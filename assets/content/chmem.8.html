       The chmem command sets a particular size or range of memory
       online or offline.

       •   Specify <i>SIZE</i> as &lt;size&gt;[m|M|g|G]. With m or M, &lt;size&gt;
           specifies the memory size in MiB (1024 x 1024 bytes). With g
           or G, &lt;size&gt; specifies the memory size in GiB (1024 x 1024 x
           1024 bytes). The default unit is MiB.

       •   Specify <i>RANGE</i> in the form 0x&lt;start&gt;-0x&lt;end&gt; as shown in the
           output of the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/lsmem.1.html">lsmem(1)</a> command. &lt;start&gt; is the hexadecimal
           address of the first byte and &lt;end&gt; is the hexadecimal
           address of the last byte in the memory range.

       •   Specify <i>BLOCKRANGE</i> in the form &lt;first&gt;-&lt;last&gt; or &lt;block&gt; as
           shown in the output of the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/lsmem.1.html">lsmem(1)</a> command. &lt;first&gt; is the
           number of the first memory block and &lt;last&gt; is the number of
           the last memory block in the memory range. Alternatively a
           single block can be specified. <i>BLOCKRANGE</i> requires the
           <b>--blocks </b>option.

       •   Specify <i>ZONE</i> as the name of a memory zone, as shown in the
           output of the <b>lsmem -o +ZONES </b>command. The output shows one
           or more valid memory zones for each memory range. If multiple
           zones are shown, then the memory range currently belongs to
           the first zone. By default, <b>chmem </b>will set memory online to
           the zone Movable, if this is among the valid zones. This
           default can be changed by specifying the <b>--zone </b>option with
           another valid zone. For memory ballooning, it is recommended
           to select the zone Movable for memory online and offline, if
           possible. Memory in this zone is much more likely to be able
           to be offlined again, but it cannot be used for arbitrary
           kernel allocations, only for migratable pages (e.g.,
           anonymous and page cache pages). Use the <b>--help </b>option to see
           all available zones.

       <i>SIZE</i> and <i>RANGE</i> must be aligned to the Linux memory block size, as
       shown in the output of the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/lsmem.1.html">lsmem(1)</a> command.

       Setting memory online can fail for various reasons. On
       virtualized systems it can fail if the hypervisor does not have
       enough memory left, for example because memory was overcommitted.
       Setting memory offline can fail if Linux cannot free the memory.
       If only part of the requested memory can be set online or
       offline, a message tells you how much memory was set online or
       offline instead of the requested amount.

       When setting memory online <b>chmem </b>starts with the lowest memory
       block numbers. When setting memory offline <b>chmem </b>starts with the
       highest memory block numbers.
