       The GNU implementation of the <i>ms</i> macro package is part of the
       <i>groff</i> document formatting system.  The <i>ms</i> package is suitable for
       the composition of letters, memoranda, reports, and books.

       These <i>groff</i> macros support cover page and table of contents
       generation, automatic section numbering, several different
       paragraph styles, a variety of text styling options, footnotes,
       multi-column page layouts, and indexing.  <i>ms</i> supports the <i>tbl</i>(1),
       <i>eqn</i>(1), <i>pic</i>(1), and <i>refer</i>(1) preprocessors for inclusion of
       tables, mathematical equations, diagrams, and standardized
       bibliographic citations.

       This implementation is mostly compatible with the documented
       interface and behavior of AT&amp;T Version 7 Unix <i>ms</i>.  Several
       extensions from 4.2BSD (Berkeley) and Version 10 Research Unix
       have been recreated.
