       The <i>uux</i> utility shall gather zero or more files from various
       systems, execute a shell pipeline (see <i>Section 2.9</i>, <i>Shell</i>
       <i>Commands</i>) on a specified system, and then send the standard
       output of the command to a file on a specified system. Only the
       first command of a pipeline can have a <i>system-name</i>!  prefix. All
       other commands in the pipeline shall be executed on the system of
       the first command.

       The following restrictions are applicable to the shell pipeline
       processed by <i>uux</i>:

        *  In gathering files from different systems, pathname expansion
           shall not be performed by <i>uux</i>.  Thus, a request such as:

               uux "c99 remsys!~/*.c"

           would attempt to copy the file named literally <b>*.c </b>to the
           local system.

        *  The redirection operators <b>"&gt;&gt;"</b>, <b>"&lt;&lt;"</b>, <b>"&gt;|"</b>, and <b>"&gt;&amp;" </b>shall
           not be accepted. Any use of these redirection operators shall
           cause this utility to write an error message describing the
           problem and exit with a non-zero exit status.

        *  The reserved word <b>!  </b>cannot be used at the head of the
           pipeline to modify the exit status.  (See the <i>command-string</i>
           operand description below.)

        *  Alias substitution shall not be performed.

       A filename can be specified as for <i>uucp</i>; it can be an absolute
       pathname, a pathname preceded by ~<i>name</i> (which is replaced by the
       corresponding login directory), a pathname specified as ~/<i>dest</i>
       (<i>dest</i> is prefixed by the public directory called <i>PUBDIR</i>; the
       actual location of <i>PUBDIR</i> is implementation-defined), or a simple
       filename (which is prefixed by <i>uux</i> with the current directory).
       See <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/uucp.1p.html">uucp(1p)</a> for the details.

       The execution of commands on remote systems shall take place in
       an execution directory known to the <i>uucp</i> system. All files
       required for the execution shall be put into this directory
       unless they already reside on that machine. Therefore, the
       application shall ensure that non-local filenames (without path
       or machine reference) are unique within the <i>uux</i> request.

       The <i>uux</i> utility shall attempt to get all files to the execution
       system. For files that are output files, the application shall
       ensure that the filename is escaped using parentheses.

       The remote system shall notify the user by mail if the requested
       command on the remote system was disallowed or the files were not
       accessible. This notification can be turned off by the <b>-n </b>option.

       Typical implementations of this utility require a communications
       line configured to use the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‚Äê2017, <i>Chapter 11</i>, <i>General Terminal Interface</i>, but other
       communications means may be used. On systems where there are no
       available communications means (either temporarily or
       permanently), this utility shall write an error message
       describing the problem and exit with a non-zero exit status.

       The <i>uux</i> utility cannot guarantee support for all character
       encodings in all circumstances. For example, transmission data
       may be restricted to 7 bits by the underlying network, 8-bit data
       and filenames need not be portable to non-internationalized
       systems, and so on. Under these circumstances, it is recommended
       that only characters defined in the ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard
       International Reference Version (equivalent to ASCII) 7-bit range
       of characters be used and that only characters defined in the
       portable filename character set be used for naming files.
