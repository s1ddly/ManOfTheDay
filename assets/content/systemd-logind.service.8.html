       <b>systemd-logind </b>is a system service that manages user logins. It
       is responsible for:

       •   Keeping track of users and sessions, their processes and
           their idle state. This is implemented by allocating a systemd
           slice unit for each user below user.slice, and a scope unit
           below it for each concurrent session of a user. Also, a
           per-user service manager is started as system service
           instance of user@.service for each logged in user.

       •   Generating and managing session IDs. If auditing is available
           and an audit session ID is already set for a session, then
           this ID is reused as the session ID. Otherwise, an
           independent session counter is used.

       •   Providing <b>polkit</b><b></b>[1]-based access for users for operations
           such as system shutdown or sleep

       •   Implementing a shutdown/sleep inhibition logic for
           applications

       •   Handling of power/sleep hardware keys

       •   Multi-seat management

       •   Session switch management

       •   Device access management for users

       •   Automatic spawning of text logins (gettys) on virtual console
           activation and user runtime directory management

       User sessions are registered with logind via the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/pam_systemd.8.html">pam_systemd(8)</a>
       PAM module.

       See <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/logind.conf.5.html">logind.conf(5)</a> for information about the configuration of
       this service.

       See <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/sd-login.3.html">sd-login(3)</a> for information about the basic concepts of
       logind such as users, sessions and seats.

       See <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/org.freedesktop.login1.5.html">org.freedesktop.login1(5)</a> and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/org.freedesktop.LogControl1.5.html">org.freedesktop.LogControl1(5)</a>
       for information about the D-Bus APIs systemd-logind provides.
