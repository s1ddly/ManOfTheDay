       By default, the <i>uname</i> utility shall write the operating system
       name to standard output. When options are specified, symbols
       representing one or more system characteristics shall be written
       to the standard output. The format and contents of the symbols
       are implementation-defined. On systems conforming to the System
       Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017, the symbols written shall be
       those supported by the <i>uname</i>() function as defined in the System
       Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017.
