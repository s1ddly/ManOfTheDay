       <b>update-alternatives </b>creates, removes, maintains and displays
       information about the symbolic links comprising the Debian
       alternatives system.

       It is possible for several programs fulfilling the same or
       similar functions to be installed on a single system at the same
       time.  For example, many systems have several text editors
       installed at once.  This gives choice to the users of a system,
       allowing each to use a different editor, if desired, but makes it
       difficult for a program to make a good choice for an editor to
       invoke if the user has not specified a particular preference.

       Debian's alternatives system aims to solve this problem.  A
       generic name in the filesystem is shared by all files providing
       interchangeable functionality.  The alternatives system and the
       system administrator together determine which actual file is
       referenced by this generic name.  For example, if the text
       editors <b>ed</b>(1) and <b>nvi</b>(1) are both installed on the system, the
       alternatives system will cause the generic name <i>/usr/bin/editor</i>
       to refer to <i>/usr/bin/nvi</i> by default. The system administrator can
       override this and cause it to refer to <i>/usr/bin/ed</i> instead, and
       the alternatives system will not alter this setting until
       explicitly requested to do so.

       The generic name is not a direct symbolic link to the selected
       alternative.  Instead, it is a symbolic link to a name in the
       <i>alternatives directory</i>, which in turn is a symbolic link to the
       actual file referenced.  This is done so that the system
       administrator's changes can be confined within the <i>/usr/local/etc</i>
       directory: the FHS (q.v.) gives reasons why this is a Good Thing.

       When each package providing a file with a particular
       functionality is installed, changed or removed,
       <b>update-alternatives </b>is called to update information about that
       file in the alternatives system.  <b>update-alternatives </b>is usually
       called from the <b>postinst </b>(configure) or <b>prerm </b>(remove and
       deconfigure) scripts in Debian packages.

       It is often useful for a number of alternatives to be
       synchronized, so that they are changed as a group; for example,
       when several versions of the <b>vi</b>(1) editor are installed, the man
       page referenced by <i>/usr/share/man/man1/vi.1</i> should correspond to
       the executable referenced by <i>/usr/bin/vi</i>.  <b>update-alternatives</b>
       handles this by means of <i>master</i> and <i>slave</i> links; when the master
       is changed, any associated slaves are changed too.  A master link
       and its associated slaves make up a <i>link group</i>.

       Each link group is, at any given time, in one of two modes:
       automatic or manual.  When a group is in automatic mode, the
       alternatives system will automatically decide, as packages are
       installed and removed, whether and how to update the links.  In
       manual mode, the alternatives system will retain the choice of
       the administrator and avoid changing the links (except when
       something is broken).

       Link groups are in automatic mode when they are first introduced
       to the system.  If the system administrator makes changes to the
       system's automatic settings, this will be noticed the next time
       <b>update-alternatives </b>is run on the changed link's group, and the
       group will automatically be switched to manual mode.

       Each alternative has a <i>priority</i> associated with it.  When a link
       group is in automatic mode, the alternatives pointed to by
       members of the group will be those which have the highest
       priority.

       When using the <b>--config </b>option, <b>update-alternatives </b>will list all
       of the choices for the link group of which given <i>name</i> is the
       master alternative name.  The current choice is marked with a
       ‘*’.  You will then be prompted for your choice regarding this
       link group.  Depending on the choice made, the link group might
       no longer be in <i>auto</i> mode. You will need to use the <b>--auto </b>option
       in order to return to the automatic mode (or you can rerun
       <b>--config </b>and select the entry marked as automatic).

       If you want to configure non-interactively you can use the <b>--set</b>
       option instead (see below).

       Different packages providing the same file need to do so
       <b>cooperatively</b>.  In other words, the usage of <b>update-alternatives</b>
       is <b>mandatory </b>for all involved packages in such case. It is not
       possible to override some file in a package that does not employ
       the <b>update-alternatives </b>mechanism.
