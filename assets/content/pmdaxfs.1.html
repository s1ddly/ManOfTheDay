       <b>pmdaxfs </b>is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
       extracts performance metrics describing the state of the XFS
       filesystem from the Linux kernel.

       The <b>xfs </b>PMDA exports metrics that measure information about
       metadata buffer usage, the journal, btree operations, inode
       operations, extended attributes, directories, quotas, read and
       write operation counts and of course throughput.

       The PMDA provides a facility to reset the values of all counters
       to zero using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmstore.1.html">pmstore(1)</a> with the xfs.control.reset metric.

       A brief description of the <b>pmdaxfs </b>command line options follows:

       <b>-d   </b>It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics <i>domain</i>
            number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is,
            <i>domain</i> should be different for every PMDA on the one host,
            and the same <i>domain</i> number should be used for the same PMDA
            on all hosts.

       <b>-l   </b>Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
            <i>xfs.log</i> is written in the current directory of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> when
            <b>pmdaxfs </b>is started, i.e.  <b>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd</b>.  If the log
            file cannot be created or is not writable, output is written
            to the standard error instead.
