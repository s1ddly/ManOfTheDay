       The mk-ca-bundle tool downloads the certdata.txt file from
       Mozilla's source tree over HTTPS, then parses certdata.txt and
       extracts certificates into PEM format. By default, only CA root
       certificates trusted to issue SSL server authentication
       certificates are extracted. These are then processed with the
       OpenSSL commandline tool to produce the final ca-bundle file.

       The default <i>outputfile</i> name is <b>ca-bundle.crt</b>. By setting it to
       '-' (a single dash) you will get the output sent to STDOUT
       instead of a file.

       The PEM format this scripts uses for output makes the result
       readily available for use by just about all OpenSSL or GnuTLS
       powered applications, such as curl, wget and more.
