       <b>readelf </b>displays information about one or more ELF format object
       files.  The options control what particular information to
       display.

       <i>elffile</i>... are the object files to be examined.  32-bit and
       64-bit ELF files are supported, as are archives containing ELF
       files.

       This program performs a similar function to <b>objdump </b>but it goes
       into more detail and it exists independently of the BFD library,
       so if there is a bug in BFD then readelf will not be affected.
