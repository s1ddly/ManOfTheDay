       <b>pmdatxmon </b>is an example Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA)
       which exports a small number of performance metrics from a
       simulated transaction monitor.

       The txmon PMDA is shipped as both binary and source code and is
       designed to be an aid for PMDA developers; the txmon PMDA
       demonstrates how performance data can be exported from an
       application (in this case <b>txrecord</b>) to the PCP infrastructure via
       a shared memory segment.  As a matter of convenience, <b>pmdatxmon</b>
       creates (and destroys on exit) the shared memory segment.

       The <i>tx_type</i> arguments are arbitrary unique tags used to identify
       different transaction types.

       The <b>txrecord </b>application simulates the processing of one or more
       transactions identified by <i>tx_type</i> and with an observed service
       time of <i>servtime .</i>

       With the <b>-l </b>option, <b>txrecord </b>displays the current summary of the
       transaction activity from the shared memory segment.

       <b>genload </b>is a shell and <b>awk</b>(1) script that acts as a front-end to
       <b>txrecord </b>to generate a constant load of simulated transaction
       activity.

       A brief description of the <b>pmdatxmon </b>command line options
       follows:

       <b>-d   </b>It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics <i>domain</i>
            number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is,
            <i>domain</i> should be different for every PMDA on the one host,
            and the same <i>domain</i> number should be used for the same PMDA
            on all hosts.

       <b>-l   </b>Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
            <i>txmon.log</i> is written in the current directory of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a>
            when <b>pmdatxmon </b>is started, i.e.  <b>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd</b>.  If the
            log file cannot be created or is not writable, output is
            written to the standard error instead.

       <b>-U   </b>User account under which to run the agent.  The default is
            the unprivileged "pcp" account in current versions of PCP,
            but in older versions the superuser account ("root") was
            used by default.
