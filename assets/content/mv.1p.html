       In the first synopsis form, the <i>mv</i> utility shall move the file
       named by the <i>source_file</i> operand to the destination specified by
       the <i>target_file</i>.  This first synopsis form is assumed when the
       final operand does not name an existing directory and is not a
       symbolic link referring to an existing directory. In this case,
       if <i>source_file</i> names a non-directory file and <i>target_file</i> ends
       with a trailing &lt;slash&gt; character, <i>mv</i> shall treat this as an
       error and no <i>source_file</i> operands will be processed.

       In the second synopsis form, <i>mv</i> shall move each file named by a
       <i>source_file</i> operand to a destination file in the existing
       directory named by the <i>target_dir</i> operand, or referenced if
       <i>target_dir</i> is a symbolic link referring to an existing directory.
       The destination path for each <i>source_file</i> shall be the
       concatenation of the target directory, a single &lt;slash&gt; character
       if the target did not end in a &lt;slash&gt;, and the last pathname
       component of the <i>source_file</i>.  This second form is assumed when
       the final operand names an existing directory.

       If any operand specifies an existing file of a type not specified
       by the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017, the behavior is
       implementation-defined.

       For each <i>source_file</i> the following steps shall be taken:

        1. If the destination path exists, the <b>-f </b>option is not
           specified, and either of the following conditions is true:

            a. The permissions of the destination path do not permit
               writing and the standard input is a terminal.

            b. The <b>-i </b>option is specified.

           the <i>mv</i> utility shall write a prompt to standard error and
           read a line from standard input. If the response is not
           affirmative, <i>mv</i> shall do nothing more with the current
           <i>source_file</i> and go on to any remaining <i>source_file</i>s.

        2. If the <i>source_file</i> operand and destination path resolve to
           either the same existing directory entry or different
           directory entries for the same existing file, then the
           destination path shall not be removed, and one of the
           following shall occur:

            a. No change is made to <i>source_file</i>, no error occurs, and no
               diagnostic is issued.

            b. No change is made to <i>source_file</i>, a diagnostic is issued
               to standard error identifying the two names, and the exit
               status is affected.

            c. If the <i>source_file</i> operand and destination path name
               distinct directory entries, then the <i>source_file</i> operand
               is removed, no error occurs, and no diagnostic is issued.

           The <i>mv</i> utility shall do nothing more with the current
           <i>source_file</i>, and go on to any remaining <i>source_file</i>s.

        3. The <i>mv</i> utility shall perform actions equivalent to the
           <i>rename</i>() function defined in the System Interfaces volume of
           POSIX.1‐2017, called with the following arguments:

            a. The <i>source_file</i> operand is used as the <i>old</i> argument.

            b. The destination path is used as the <i>new</i> argument.

           If this succeeds, <i>mv</i> shall do nothing more with the current
           <i>source_file</i> and go on to any remaining <i>source_file</i>s.  If this
           fails for any reasons other than those described for the
           <i><a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/errno.3.html">errno</a></i> <b>[EXDEV] </b>in the System Interfaces volume of
           POSIX.1‐2017, <i>mv</i> shall write a diagnostic message to standard
           error, do nothing more with the current <i>source_file</i>, and go
           on to any remaining <i>source_file</i>s.

        4. If the destination path exists, and it is a file of type
           directory and <i>source_file</i> is not a file of type directory, or
           it is a file not of type directory and <i>source_file</i> is a file
           of type directory, <i>mv</i> shall write a diagnostic message to
           standard error, do nothing more with the current <i>source_file</i>,
           and go on to any remaining <i>source_file</i>s.  If the destination
           path exists and was created by a previous step, it is
           unspecified whether this will treated as an error or the
           destination path will be overwritten.

        5. If the destination path exists, <i>mv</i> shall attempt to remove
           it. If this fails for any reason, <i>mv</i> shall write a diagnostic
           message to standard error, do nothing more with the current
           <i>source_file</i>, and go on to any remaining <i>source_file</i>s.

        6. The file hierarchy rooted in <i>source_file</i> shall be duplicated
           as a file hierarchy rooted in the destination path. If
           <i>source_file</i> or any of the files below it in the hierarchy are
           symbolic links, the links themselves shall be duplicated,
           including their contents, rather than any files to which they
           refer. The following characteristics of each file in the file
           hierarchy shall be duplicated:

            *  The time of last data modification and time of last
               access

            *  The user ID and group ID

            *  The file mode

           If the user ID, group ID, or file mode of a regular file
           cannot be duplicated, the file mode bits S_ISUID and S_ISGID
           shall not be duplicated.

           When files are duplicated to another file system, the
           implementation may require that the process invoking <i>mv</i> has
           read access to each file being duplicated.

           If files being duplicated to another file system have hard
           links to other files, it is unspecified whether the files
           copied to the new file system have the hard links preserved
           or separate copies are created for the linked files.

           If the duplication of the file hierarchy fails for any
           reason, <i>mv</i> shall write a diagnostic message to standard
           error, do nothing more with the current <i>source_file</i>, and go
           on to any remaining <i>source_file</i>s.

           If the duplication of the file characteristics fails for any
           reason, <i>mv</i> shall write a diagnostic message to standard
           error, but this failure shall not cause <i>mv</i> to modify its exit
           status.

        7. The file hierarchy rooted in <i>source_file</i> shall be removed. If
           this fails for any reason, <i>mv</i> shall write a diagnostic
           message to the standard error, do nothing more with the
           current <i>source_file</i>, and go on to any remaining <i>source_file</i>s.
