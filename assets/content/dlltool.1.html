       <b>dlltool </b>reads its inputs, which can come from the <b>-d </b>and <b>-b</b>
       options as well as object files specified on the command line.
       It then processes these inputs and if the <b>-e </b>option has been
       specified it creates a exports file.  If the <b>-l </b>option has been
       specified it creates a library file and if the <b>-z </b>option has been
       specified it creates a def file.  Any or all of the <b>-e</b>, <b>-l </b>and <b>-z</b>
       options can be present in one invocation of dlltool.

       When creating a DLL, along with the source for the DLL, it is
       necessary to have three other files.  <b>dlltool </b>can help with the
       creation of these files.

       The first file is a <i>.def</i> file which specifies which functions are
       exported from the DLL, which functions the DLL imports, and so
       on.  This is a text file and can be created by hand, or <b>dlltool</b>
       can be used to create it using the <b>-z </b>option.  In this case
       <b>dlltool </b>will scan the object files specified on its command line
       looking for those functions which have been specially marked as
       being exported and put entries for them in the <i>.def</i> file it
       creates.

       In order to mark a function as being exported from a DLL, it
       needs to have an <b>-export:&lt;name_of_function&gt; </b>entry in the <b>.drectve</b>
       section of the object file.  This can be done in C by using the
       <b>asm() </b>operator:

                 asm (".section .drectve");
                 asm (".ascii \"-export:my_func\"");

                 int my_func (void) { ... }

       The second file needed for DLL creation is an exports file.  This
       file is linked with the object files that make up the body of the
       DLL and it handles the interface between the DLL and the outside
       world.  This is a binary file and it can be created by giving the
       <b>-e </b>option to <b>dlltool </b>when it is creating or reading in a <i>.def</i>
       file.

       The third file needed for DLL creation is the library file that
       programs will link with in order to access the functions in the
       DLL (an `import library').  This file can be created by giving
       the <b>-l </b>option to dlltool when it is creating or reading in a <i>.def</i>
       file.

       If the <b>-y </b>option is specified, dlltool generates a delay-import
       library that can be used instead of the normal import library to
       allow a program to link to the dll only as soon as an imported
       function is called for the first time. The resulting executable
       will need to be linked to the static delayimp library containing
       _<b>_delayLoadHelper2()</b>, which in turn will import LoadLibraryA and
       GetProcAddress from kernel32.

       <b>dlltool </b>builds the library file by hand, but it builds the
       exports file by creating temporary files containing assembler
       statements and then assembling these.  The <b>-S </b>command-line option
       can be used to specify the path to the assembler that dlltool
       will use, and the <b>-f </b>option can be used to pass specific flags to
       that assembler.  The <b>-n </b>can be used to prevent dlltool from
       deleting these temporary assembler files when it is done, and if
       <b>-n </b>is specified twice then this will prevent dlltool from
       deleting the temporary object files it used to build the library.

       Here is an example of creating a DLL from a source file <b>dll.c </b>and
       also creating a program (from an object file called <b>program.o</b>)
       that uses that DLL:

                 gcc -c dll.c
                 dlltool -e exports.o -l dll.lib dll.o
                 gcc dll.o exports.o -o dll.dll
                 gcc program.o dll.lib -o program

       <b>dlltool </b>may also be used to query an existing import library to
       determine the name of the DLL to which it is associated.  See the
       description of the <b>-I </b>or <b>--identify </b>option.
