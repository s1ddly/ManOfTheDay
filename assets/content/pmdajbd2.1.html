       <b>pmdajbd2 </b>is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
       extracts performance metrics from the Journal Block Device
       subsystem (version 2) in the Linux kernel.  These metrics are
       exported by the kernel in procfs files, one file per block
       device.  The JBD2 subsystem is used by several filesystems
       including ext3, ext4 and ocfs2.

       The <b>jbd2 </b>PMDA exports metrics that measure detailed journal
       transaction information, such as time spent waiting and locked,
       request rates, blocks used and so on.

       A brief description of the <b>pmdajbd2 </b>command line options follows
       (these are only relevant when running the PMDA as a daemon, and
       not as a shared library):

       <b>-d   </b>It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics <i>domain</i>
            number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is,
            <i>domain</i> should be different for every PMDA on the one host,
            and the same <i>domain</i> number should be used for the same PMDA
            on all hosts.

       <b>-l   </b>Location of the log file.  By default, when running as a
            daemon a log file named <i>jbd2.log</i> is written in the current
            directory of when <b>pmdajbd2 </b>is started, i.e.
            <b>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd</b>.  If the log file cannot be created or is
            not writable, output is written to the standard error
            instead.  When running in shared library mode, and
            diagnostic information will be written into the <b>pmcd </b>log
            file, namely <b>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/pmcd.log</b>.

       <b>-j   </b>Allows an alternate path to the jbd2 statistics files to be
            specified.  The default path is <i>/proc/fs/jbd2</i>.

       <b>-U   </b>User account under which to run the agent.  The default is
            the unprivileged "pcp" account in current versions of PCP,
            but in older versions the superuser account ("root") was
            used by default.
