       <b>pmdadm </b>is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which exports
       metric values for Device Mapper on the local system.

       This PMDA collects its data through the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/dmsetup.8.html">dmsetup(8)</a> utility and
       the dmstats API and requires that the program is installed in
       order to function.  In addition, at least one statistics region
       must be created using the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/dmstats.8.html">dmstats(8)</a> utility in order to get
       basic counter values.  See below for examples.

       Note that device-mapper statistics collection is not enabled by
       default and is not persistent across reboots (unless a system
       administrator has configured something to run in <b>rc.local </b>or
       equivalent).  This is because there are overheads associated with
       statistics collection.  In addition, the <b>pmdadm </b>PMDA does not
       automatically enable any statistics collection because it may not
       be the only consumer of the data.
