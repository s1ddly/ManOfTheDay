       This manual page describes SELinux policy booleans.   The SELinux
       policy can include conditional rules that are enabled or disabled
       based on the current values of a set of policy booleans.  These
       policy booleans allow runtime modification of the security policy
       without having to load a new policy.

       For example, the boolean httpd_enable_cgi allows the httpd daemon
       to run cgi scripts if it is enabled.  If the administrator does
       not want to allow execution of cgi scripts, he can simply disable
       this boolean value.

       The policy defines a default value for each boolean, typically
       false.  These default values can be overridden via local settings
       created via the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/setsebool.8.html">setsebool(8)</a> utility, using <b>-P </b>to make the
       setting persistent across reboots.  The
       <b>system-config-securitylevel </b>tool provides a graphical interface
       for altering the settings.  The <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/load_policy.8.html">load_policy(8)</a> program will
       preserve current boolean settings upon a policy reload by
       default, or can optionally reset booleans to the boot-time
       defaults via the <b>-b </b>option.

       Boolean values can be listed by using the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/getsebool.8.html">getsebool(8)</a> utility
       and passing it the <b>-a </b>option.

       Boolean values can also be changed at runtime via the
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/setsebool.8.html">setsebool(8)</a> utility or the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/togglesebool.8.html">togglesebool(8)</a> utility.  By default,
       these utilities only change the current boolean value and do not
       affect the persistent settings, unless the <b>-P </b>option is used to
       setsebool.
