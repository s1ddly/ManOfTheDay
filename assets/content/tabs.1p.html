       The <i>tabs</i> utility shall display a series of characters that first
       clears the hardware terminal tab settings and then initializes
       the tab stops at the specified positions and optionally adjusts
       the margin.

       The phrase ``tab-stop position <i>N</i>'' shall be taken to mean that,
       from the start of a line of output, tabbing to position <i>N</i> shall
       cause the next character output to be in the (<i>N</i>+1)th column
       position on that line. The maximum number of tab stops allowed is
       terminal-dependent.

       It need not be possible to implement <i>tabs</i> on certain terminals.
       If the terminal type obtained from the <i>TERM</i> environment variable
       or <b>-T </b>option represents such a terminal, an appropriate
       diagnostic message shall be written to standard error and <i>tabs</i>
       shall exit with a status greater than zero.
