<pre>
       The <i>uudecode</i> utility shall read a file, or standard input if no
       file is specified, that includes data created by the <i>uuencode</i>
       utility. The <i>uudecode</i> utility shall scan the input file,
       searching for data compatible with one of the formats specified
       in <i>uuencode</i>, and attempt to create or overwrite the file
       described by the data (or overridden by the <b>-o </b>option). The
       pathname shall be contained in the data or specified by the <b>-o</b>
       option. The file access permission bits and contents for the file
       to be produced shall be contained in that data. The mode bits of
       the created file (other than standard output) shall be set from
       the file access permission bits contained in the data; that is,
       other attributes of the mode, including the file mode creation
       mask (see <i>umask</i>), shall not affect the file being produced. If
       either of the <i>op</i> characters <b>'+' </b>and <b>'-' </b>(see <i>chmod</i>) are specified
       in symbolic mode, the initial mode on which those operations are
       based is unspecified.

       If the pathname of the file resolves to an existing file and the
       user does not have write permission on that file, <i>uudecode</i> shall
       terminate with an error. If the pathname of the file resolves to
       an existing file and the user has write permission on that file,
       the existing file shall be overwritten and, if possible, the mode
       bits of the file (other than standard output) shall be set as
       described above; if the mode bits cannot be set, <i>uudecode</i> shall
       not treat this as an error.

       If the input data was produced by <i>uuencode</i> on a system with a
       different number of bits per byte than on the target system, the
       results of <i>uudecode</i> are unspecified.
