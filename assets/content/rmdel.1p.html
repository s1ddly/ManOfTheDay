<pre>
       The <i>rmdel</i> utility shall remove the delta specified by the SID
       from each named SCCS file. The delta to be removed shall be the
       most recent delta in its branch in the delta chain of each named
       SCCS file. In addition, the application shall ensure that the SID
       specified is not that of a version being edited for the purpose
       of making a delta; that is, if a <i>p-file</i> (see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/get.1p.html">get(1p)</a>) exists for
       the named SCCS file, the SID specified shall not appear in any
       entry of the <i>p-file</i>.

       Removal of a delta shall be restricted to:

        1. The user who made the delta

        2. The owner of the SCCS file

        3. The owner of the directory containing the SCCS file
