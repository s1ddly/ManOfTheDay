       <b>btrfs-convert </b>is used to convert existing source filesystem image
       to a btrfs filesystem in-place. The original filesystem image is
       accessible in subvolume named like <i>ext2_saved</i> as file <i>image</i>.

       Supported filesystems:

       •   ext2, ext3, ext4 — original feature, always built in

       •   reiserfs — since version 4.13, optionally built, requires
           libreiserfscore 3.6.27

       The list of supported source filesystem by a given binary is
       listed at the end of help (option <i>--help</i>).

           <b>Warning</b>
           If you are going to perform rollback to the original
           filesystem, you should not execute <b>btrfs balance </b>command on
           the converted filesystem. This will change the extent layout
           and make <b>btrfs-convert </b>unable to rollback.

       The conversion utilizes free space of the original filesystem.
       The exact estimate of the required space cannot be foretold. The
       final btrfs metadata might occupy several gigabytes on a
       hundreds-gigabyte filesystem.

       If the ability to rollback is no longer important, the it is
       recommended to perform a few more steps to transition the btrfs
       filesystem to a more compact layout. This is because the
       conversion inherits the original data blocks' fragmentation, and
       also because the metadata blocks are bound to the original free
       space layout.

       Due to different constraints, it is only possible to convert
       filesystems that have a supported data block size (ie. the same
       that would be valid for <i>mkfs.btrfs</i>). This is typically the system
       page size (4KiB on x86_64 machines).

       <b>BEFORE YOU START</b>

       The source filesystem must be clean, eg. no journal to replay or
       no repairs needed. The respective <i>fsck</i> utility must be run on the
       source filesytem prior to conversion. Please refer to the manual
       pages in case you encounter problems.

       For ext2/3/4:

           # e2fsck -fvy /dev/sdx

       For reiserfs:

           # reiserfsck -fy /dev/sdx

       Skipping that step could lead to incorrect results on the target
       filesystem, but it may work.

       <b>REMOVE THE ORIGINAL FILESYSTEM METADATA</b>

       By removing the subvolume named like <i>ext2_saved</i> or
       <i>reiserfs_saved</i>, all metadata of the original filesystem will be
       removed:

           # btrfs subvolume delete /mnt/ext2_saved

       At this point it is not possible to do a rollback. The filesystem
       is usable but may be impacted by the fragmentation inherited from
       the original filesystem.

       <b>MAKE FILE DATA MORE CONTIGUOUS</b>

       An optional but recommended step is to run defragmentation on the
       entire filesystem. This will attempt to make file extents more
       contiguous.

           # btrfs filesystem defrag -v -r -f -t 32M /mnt/btrfs

       Verbose recursive defragmentation (<i>-v</i>, <i>-r</i>), flush data per-file
       (<i>-f</i>) with target extent size 32MiB (<i>-t</i>).

       <b>ATTEMPT TO MAKE BTRFS METADATA MORE COMPACT</b>

       Optional but recommended step.

       The metadata block groups after conversion may be smaller than
       the default size (256MiB or 1GiB). Running a balance will attempt
       to merge the block groups. This depends on the free space layout
       (and fragmentation) and may fail due to lack of enough work
       space. This is a soft error leaving the filesystem usable but the
       block group layout may remain unchanged.

       Note that balance operation takes a lot of time, please see also
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/btrfs-balance.8.html">btrfs-balance(8)</a>.

           # btrfs balance start -m /mnt/btrfs
