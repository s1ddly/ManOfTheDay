       <b>insmod </b>is a trivial program to insert a module into the kernel.
       Most users will want to use <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/modprobe.8.html">modprobe(8)</a> instead, which is more
       clever and can handle module dependencies.

       Only the most general of error messages are reported: as the work
       of trying to link the module is now done inside the kernel, the
       <b>dmesg </b>usually gives more information about errors.
