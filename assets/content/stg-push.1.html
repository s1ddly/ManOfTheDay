<pre>
       Push one or more patches (defaulting to the first unapplied one)
       onto the stack. The <i>push</i> operation allows patch reordering by
       commuting them with the three-way merge algorithm. If there are
       conflicts while pushing a patch, those conflicts are written to
       the work tree, and the command halts. Conflicts raised during the
       push operation have to be fixed and the <i>git add --update</i> command
       run (alternatively, you may undo the conflicting push with <i>stg</i>
       <i>undo</i>).

       The command also notifies when the patch becomes empty (fully
       merged upstream) or is modified (three-way merged) by the <i>push</i>
       operation.
