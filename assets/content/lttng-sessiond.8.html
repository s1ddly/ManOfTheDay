       The <i>Linux Trace Toolkit: next generation</i> &lt;<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pagestps://lttng.org/">https://lttng.org/</a>&gt; is
       an open source software package used for correlated tracing of
       the Linux kernel, user applications, and user libraries.

       LTTng consists of Linux kernel modules (for Linux kernel tracing)
       and dynamically loaded libraries (for user application and
       library tracing).

       The <i>LTTng session daemon</i> is a tracing registry which allows the
       user to interact with multiple tracers (kernel and user space)
       within the same container, a <i>tracing session</i>. Traces can be
       gathered from the Linux kernel and/or from instrumented
       applications (see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/lttng-ust.3.html">lttng-ust(3)</a>). You can aggregate and read the
       events of LTTng traces using <b>babeltrace</b>(1).

       To trace the Linux kernel, the session daemon needs to be running
       as <b>root</b>. LTTng uses a <i>tracing group</i> to allow specific users to
       interact with the root session daemon. The default tracing group
       name is <b>tracing</b>. You can use the <b>--group </b>option to set the
       tracing group name to use.

       Session daemons can coexist. You can have a session daemon
       running as user Alice that can be used to trace her applications
       alongside a root session daemon or a session daemon running as
       user Bob.

       The LTTng session daemon manages trace data consumer daemons by
       spawning them when necessary. You do not need to manage the
       consumer daemons manually.

           <b>Note</b>
           It is highly recommended to start the session daemon at boot
           time for stable and long-term tracing.

   <b>Automatic loading of tracing session configurations</b>
       When the session daemon starts, it automatically loads session
       configuration files.

       The following directories are searched, non-recursively, in this
       order for configuration files to load on launch:

        1. <b>$LTTNG_HOME/.lttng/sessions/auto </b>(<b>$LTTNG_HOME </b>defaults to
           <b>$HOME</b>)

        2. <b>/usr/local/etc/lttng/sessions/auto</b>

       Note that both the directory containing the tracing session
       configurations <i>and</i> the session daemon binary <i>must</i> share the same
       UID for the configurations to be automatically loaded.

       The <b>--load </b>option overrides the default directories <i>and</i> the UID
       check. The session daemon simply checks if the path is accessible
       and tries to load every tracing session configuration in it. When
       this option is specified, the default directories are NOT
       searched for configuration files. When the option is not
       specified, <i>both</i> default directories are searched for
       configuration files.

       If the <b>--load </b>optionâ€™s argument is a directory, then all the
       tracing session configurations found in all the files in this
       directory are loaded. If the argument is a file, then all the
       tracing session configurations found in this file are loaded.
