<pre>
       This program is invoked by the kernel when the kernel is asked
       for a key that it doesn't have immediately available. The kernel
       creates a partially set up key and then calls out to this program
       to instantiate it. It is not intended to be called directly.

       However, for debugging purposes, it can be given some options on
       the command line:

       <b>-d     </b>Turn on debugging mode.  In this mode, no attempts are
              made to access any keys and, if a handler program is
              selected, it won't be executed; instead, this program will
              print a message and exit 0.

       <b>-D     </b>In debugging mode, use the proposed key description
              specified with this rather than the sample
              ("user;0;0;1f0000;debug:1234") built into the program.

       <b>-l     </b>Use configuration from the current directory.  The program
              will use <i>request-key.d/*</i> and <i>request-key.conf</i> from the
              current directory rather than from <i>/etc</i>.

       <b>-n     </b>Don't log to the system log.  Ordinarily, error messages
              and debugging messages will be copied to the system log -
              this will prevent that.

       <b>-v     </b>Turn on debugging output.  This may be specified multiple
              times to produce increasing levels of verbosity.

       <b>--version</b>
              Print the program version and exit.
