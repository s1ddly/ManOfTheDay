       When called without the --cache option, pvscan lists PVs on the
       system, like <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/pvs.8.html">pvs(8)</a> or <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/pvdisplay.8.html">pvdisplay(8)</a>.

       When the --cache and -aay options are used, pvscan records which
       PVs are available on the system, and activates LVs in completed
       VGs.  A VG is complete when pvscan sees that the final PV in the
       VG has appeared.  This is used by event-based system startup
       (systemd, udev) to activate LVs.

       The four main variations of this are:

       <b>pvscan --cache </b><i>device</i>

       If device is present, lvm adds a record that the PV on device is
       online.  If device is not present, lvm removes the online record
       for the PV.  In most cases, the pvscan will only read the named
       devices.

       <b>pvscan --cache -aay </b><i>device</i>...

       This begins by performing the same steps as above.  Afterward, if
       the VG for the specified PV is complete, then pvscan will
       activate LVs in the VG (the same as vgchange -aay vgname would
       do.)

       <b>pvscan --cache</b>

       This first clears all existing PV online records, then scans all
       devices on the system, adding PV online records for any PVs that
       are found.

       <b>pvscan --cache -aay</b>

       This begins by performing the same steps as pvscan --cache.
       Afterward, it activates LVs in any complete VGs.

       To prevent devices from being scanned by pvscan --cache, add them
       to <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/lvm.conf.5.html">lvm.conf(5)</a> <b>devices/global_filter.  </b>For more information, see:
       <b>lvmconfig --withcomments devices/global_filter</b>

       Auto-activation of VGs or LVs can be enabled/disabled using:
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/lvm.conf.5.html">lvm.conf(5)</a> <b>activation/auto_activation_volume_list</b>

       For more information, see:
       <b>lvmconfig --withcomments activation/auto_activation_volume_list</b>

       To disable auto-activation, explicitly set this list to an empty
       list, i.e. auto_activation_volume_list = [ ].

       When this setting is undefined (e.g. commented), then all LVs are
       auto-activated.
