       The <b>sar </b>command writes to standard output the contents of
       selected cumulative activity counters in the operating system.
       The accounting system, based on the values in the <i>count</i> and
       <i>interval</i> parameters, writes information the specified number of
       times spaced at the specified intervals in seconds.  If the
       <i>interval</i> parameter is set to zero, the <b>sar </b>command displays the
       average statistics for the time since the system was started. If
       the <i>interval</i> parameter is specified without the <i>count</i> parameter,
       then reports are generated continuously.  The collected data can
       also be saved in the file specified by the <b>-o </b><i>filename</i> flag, in
       addition to being displayed onto the screen. If <i>filename</i> is
       omitted, <b>sar </b>uses the standard system activity daily data file
       (see below).  By default all the data available from the kernel
       are saved in the data file.

       The <b>sar </b>command extracts and writes to standard output records
       previously saved in a file. This file can be either the one
       specified by the <b>-f </b>flag or, by default, the standard system
       activity daily data file.  It is also possible to enter <b>-1</b>, <b>-2</b>
       etc. as an argument to <b>sar </b>to display data of that days ago. For
       example, <b>-1 </b>will point at the standard system activity file of
       yesterday.

       Standard system activity daily data files are named <i>saDD</i> or
       <i>saYYYYMMDD</i>, where <i>YYYY</i> stands for the current year, <i>MM</i> for the
       current month and <i>DD</i> for the current day. They are the default
       files used by <b>sar </b>only when no filename has been explicitly
       specified.  When used to write data to files (with its option
       <b>-o</b>), <b>sar </b>will use <i>saYYYYMMDD</i> if option <b>-D </b>has also been
       specified, else it will use <i>saDD</i>.  When used to display the
       records previously saved in a file, <b>sar </b>will look for the most
       recent of <i>saDD</i> and <i>saYYYYMMDD</i>, and use it.

       Standard system activity daily data files are located in the
       <i>/var/log/sa</i> directory by default. Yet it is possible to specify
       an alternate location for them: If a directory (instead of a
       plain file) is used with options <b>-f </b>or <b>-o </b>then it will be
       considered as the directory containing the data files.

       Without the <b>-P </b>flag, the <b>sar </b>command reports system-wide (global
       among all processors) statistics, which are calculated as
       averages for values expressed as percentages, and as sums
       otherwise. If the <b>-P </b>flag is given, the <b>sar </b>command reports
       activity which relates to the specified processor or processors.
       If <b>-P ALL </b>is given, the <b>sar </b>command reports statistics for each
       individual processor and global statistics among all processors.
       Offline processors are not displayed.

       You can select information about specific system activities using
       flags. Not specifying any flags selects only CPU activity.
       Specifying the <b>-A </b>flag selects all possible activities.

       The default version of the <b>sar </b>command (CPU utilization report)
       might be one of the first facilities the user runs to begin
       system activity investigation, because it monitors major system
       resources. If CPU utilization is near 100 percent (user + nice +
       system), the workload sampled is CPU-bound.

       If multiple samples and multiple reports are desired, it is
       convenient to specify an output file for the <b>sar </b>command. Run the
       <b>sar </b>command as a background process. The syntax for this is:

       <b>sar -o </b><i>datafile interval count</i> <b>&gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;</b>

       All data are captured in binary form and saved to a file
       (<i>datafile</i>).  The data can then be selectively displayed with the
       <b>sar </b>command using the <b>-f </b>option. Set the <i>interval</i> and <i>count</i>
       parameters to select <i>count</i> records at <i>interval</i> second intervals.
       If the <i>count</i> parameter is not set, all the records saved in the
       file will be selected.  Collection of data in this manner is
       useful to characterize system usage over a period of time and
       determine peak usage hours.

       Note: The <b>sar </b>command only reports on local activities.
