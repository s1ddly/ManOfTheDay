       <b>xfs_metadump </b>is a debugging tool that copies the metadata from an
       XFS filesystem to a file.  The <i>source</i> argument must be the
       pathname of the device or file containing the XFS filesystem and
       the <i>target</i> argument specifies the destination file name.  If
       <i>target</i> is -, then the output is sent to stdout. This allows the
       output to be redirected to another program such as a compression
       application.

       <b>xfs_metadump </b>may only be used to copy unmounted filesystems, or
       read-only mounted filesystems.

       <b>xfs_metadump </b>does not alter the source filesystem in any way. The
       <i>target</i> image is a contiguous (non-sparse) file containing all the
       filesystem's metadata and indexes to where the blocks were copied
       from.

       By default, <b>xfs_metadump </b>obfuscates most file (regular file,
       directory and symbolic link) names and extended attribute names
       to allow the dumps to be sent without revealing confidential
       information. Extended attribute values are zeroed and no data is
       copied. The only exceptions are file or attribute names that are
       4 or less characters in length. Also file names that span extents
       (this can only occur with the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/mkfs.xfs.8.html">mkfs.xfs(8)</a> options where <b>-n </b><i>size</i> &gt;
       <b>-b </b><i>size</i>) are not obfuscated. Names between 5 and 8 characters in
       length inclusively are partially obfuscated.

       <b>xfs_metadump </b>cannot obfuscate metadata in the filesystem log.
       Log recovery of an obfuscated metadump image may expose clear-
       text metadata and/or cause filesystem corruption in the restored
       image.  It is recommended that the source filesystem first be
       mounted and unmounted, if possible, to ensure that the log is
       clean.  A subsequent invocation of <b>xfs_metadump </b>will capture a
       clean log and obfuscate all metadata correctly.

       If a metadump must be produced from a filesystem with a dirty
       log, it is recommended that obfuscation be turned off with -o
       option, if metadata such as filenames is not considered
       sensitive.  If obfuscation is required on a metadump with a dirty
       log, please inform the recipient of the metadump image about this
       situation.

       <b>xfs_metadump </b>should not be used for any purposes other than for
       debugging and reporting filesystem problems. The most common
       usage scenario for this tool is when <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/xfs_repair.8.html">xfs_repair(8)</a> fails to
       repair a filesystem and a metadump image can be sent for
       analysis.

       The file generated by <b>xfs_metadump </b>can be restored to filesystem
       image (minus the data) using the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/xfs_mdrestore.8.html">xfs_mdrestore(8)</a> tool.
