       <i>grodvi</i> is a driver for <i>groff</i> that produces TeX DVI format.
       Normally it should be run via “<b>groff -Tdvi</b>”.  This will run “‐
       <b>troff -Tdvi</b>”, read the macros in <i>/usr/local/share/groff/1.23.0/</i>
       <i>tmac/dvi.tmac</i>, and pipe the output to <i>grodvi</i>.

       The DVI file generated by <i>grodvi</i> can be printed by any correctly-
       written DVI driver.  <i>troff</i> drawing primitives are implemented
       using <i>tpic</i> version 2 specials.  If the driver does not support
       these, the <b>\D </b>commands will not produce any output.

       There is an additional drawing command available:

       <b>\D'R </b><i>dh dv</i><b>'</b>
              Draw a rule (solid black rectangle), with one corner at
              the current position, and the diagonally opposite corner
              at the current position +(<i>dh</i>,<i>dv</i>).  Afterwards the current
              position will be at the opposite corner.  This produces a
              rule in the DVI file and so can be printed even with a
              driver that does not support the <i>tpic</i> specials unlike the
              other <b>\D </b>commands.

       The <i>groff</i> command <b>\X'</b><i>anything</i><b>' </b>is translated into the same
       command in the DVI file as would be produced by
       <b>\special{</b><i>anything</i><b>} </b>in TeX; <i>anything</i> may not contain a newline.

       For inclusion of EPS image files, <b>-Tdvi </b>loads <i>pspic.tmac</i>
       automatically, providing the <b>.PSPIC </b>macro.  See <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/groff_tmac.5.html">groff_tmac(5)</a> for
       a detailed description.

       Font files for <i>grodvi</i> can be created from TFM (TeX font metrics)
       files using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/tfmtodit.1.html">tfmtodit(1)</a>.  The font description file should
       contain the following additional commands:

       <b>internalname </b><i>name</i>
              The name of the TFM file (without the <i>.tfm</i> extension) is
              <i>name</i>.

       <b>checksum </b><i>n</i>
              The checksum in the TFM file is <i>n</i>.

       <b>designsize </b><i>n</i>
              The designsize in the TFM file is <i>n</i>.

       These are automatically generated by <i>tfmtodit.</i>

       The default color for <b>\m </b>and <b>\M </b>is black.  Currently, the drawing
       color for <b>\D </b>commands is always black, and fill color values are
       translated to gray.

       In <i>groff</i>, as in AT&amp;T <i>troff</i>, the <b>\N </b>escape sequence can be used to
       access characters by their position in the corresponding TFM
       file; all characters in the TFM file can be accessed this way.

       By design, the DVI format doesn't care about physical dimensions
       of the output medium.  Instead, <i>grodvi</i> emits the equivalent to
       TeX's <b>\special{papersize=</b><i>width</i><b>,</b><i>length</i><b>} </b>on the first page; <i>dvips</i>
       (and possibly other DVI drivers) then sets the page size
       accordingly.  If either the page width or length is not positive,
       no <b>papersize </b>special is output.
