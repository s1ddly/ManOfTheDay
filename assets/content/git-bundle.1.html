       Create, unpack, and manipulate "bundle" files. Bundles are used
       for the "offline" transfer of Git objects without an active
       "server" sitting on the other side of the network connection.

       They can be used to create both incremental and full backups of a
       repository, and to relay the state of the references in one
       repository to another.

       Git commands that fetch or otherwise "read" via protocols such as
       <b>ssh:// </b>and <b>https:// </b>can also operate on bundle files. It is
       possible <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/git-clone.1.html">git-clone(1)</a> a new repository from a bundle, to use
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/git-fetch.1.html">git-fetch(1)</a> to fetch from one, and to list the references
       contained within it with <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/git-ls-remote.1.html">git-ls-remote(1)</a>. Thereâ€™s no
       corresponding "write" support, i.e.a <i>git push</i> into a bundle is
       not supported.

       See the "EXAMPLES" section below for examples of how to use
       bundles.
