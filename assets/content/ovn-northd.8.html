       <b>ovn-northd </b>is a centralized daemon responsible for translating
       the high-level OVN configuration into logical configuration
       consumable by daemons such as <b>ovn-controller</b>. It translates the
       logical network configuration in terms of conventional network
       concepts, taken from the OVN Northbound Database (see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/ovn-nb.5.html">ovn-nb(5)</a>),
       into logical datapath flows in the OVN Southbound Database (see
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/ovn-sb.5.html">ovn-sb(5)</a>) below it.
