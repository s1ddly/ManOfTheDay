       The <i>Linux Trace Toolkit: next generation</i> &lt;<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pagestps://lttng.org/">https://lttng.org/</a>&gt; is
       an open source software package used for correlated tracing of
       the Linux kernel, user applications, and user libraries.

       LTTng consists of Linux kernel modules (for Linux kernel tracing)
       and dynamically loaded libraries (for user application and
       library tracing).

       The <i>LTTng relay daemon</i> is responsible for receiving trace data
       from possibly remote LTTng session/consumer daemons and for
       writing it to the local file system. The relay daemon also
       accepts <i>LTTng live</i> connections from compatible viewers; this is
       the official approach to viewing LTTng events as they are
       emitted.

       The relay daemon listens by default on all network interfaces to
       gather trace data, but only on localhost for LTTng live
       connections.

       The relay daemon does not require any particular permissions, as
       long as it can write to the output directory and listen on the
       configured ports. If a user is within a secured network and/or
       has proper firewall settings, <b>lttng-relayd </b>can listen to LTTng
       live connections from <i>all</i> network interfaces by specifying
       <b>--live-port=tcp://localhost:5344</b>.

       Once a trace has been streamed completely, the trace can be
       processed by any tool that can process an LTTng trace located on
       the local file system.

   <b>Output directory</b>
       By default, the relay daemon writes the traces to:

           $LTTNG_HOME/lttng-traces/<i>HOSTNAME</i>/<i>SESSION</i>/<i>DOMAIN</i>

       with:

       <i>HOSTNAME</i>
           Remote hostname.

       <i>SESSION</i>
           Full session name.

       <i>DOMAIN</i>
           Tracing domain.

       You can override the default output directory prefix
       (<b>$LTTNG_HOME/lttng-traces</b>) with the <b>--output </b>option. The other
       parts depend on the remote configuration.

   <b>URL format</b>
       The <b>--control-port</b>, <b>--data-port</b>, and <b>--live-port </b>options specify
       URLs.

       The format of those URLs is:

           tcp://(<i>HOST</i> | <i>IPADDR</i>):<i>PORT</i>

       with:

       (<i>HOST</i> | <i>IPADDR</i>)
           Binding hostname or IP address (IPv6 address <b>must </b>be enclosed
           in brackets (<b>[ </b>and <b>]</b>); see RFC 2732

       <i>PORT</i>
           TCP port.
