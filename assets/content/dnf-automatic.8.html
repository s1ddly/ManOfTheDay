       Alternative CLI to <b>dnf upgrade </b>with specific facilities to make
       it suitable to be executed automatically and regularly from
       systemd timers, cron jobs and similar.

       The operation of the tool is usually controlled by the
       configuration file or the function-specific timer units (see
       below). The command only accepts a single optional argument
       pointing to the config file, and some control arguments intended
       for use by the services that back the timer units. If no
       configuration file is passed from the command line,
       <b>/etc/dnf/automatic.conf </b>is used.

       The tool synchronizes package metadata as needed and then checks
       for updates available for the given system and then either exits,
       downloads the packages or downloads and applies the packages. The
       outcome of the operation is then reported by a selected
       mechanism, for instance via the standard output, email or MOTD
       messages.

       The systemd timer unit <b>dnf-automatic.timer </b>will behave as the
       configuration file specifies (see below) with regard to whether
       to download and apply updates. Some other timer units are
       provided which override the configuration file with some standard
       behaviours:

       • dnf-automatic-notifyonly

       • dnf-automatic-download

       • dnf-automatic-install

       Regardless of the configuration file settings, the first will
       only notify of available updates. The second will download, but
       not install them. The third will download and install them.
