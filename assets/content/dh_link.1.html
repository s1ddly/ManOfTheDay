       <b>dh_link </b>is a debhelper program that creates symlinks in package
       build directories.

       <b>dh_link </b>accepts a list of pairs of source and destination files.
       The source files are the already existing files that will be
       symlinked from (called <b>target </b>by <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ln.1.html">ln(1)</a>). The destination files
       are the symlinks that will be created (called <b>link name </b>by
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ln.1.html">ln(1)</a>). There <b>must </b>be an equal number of source and destination
       files specified.

       Be sure you <b>do </b>specify the absolute path to both the source and
       destination files (unlike you would do if you were using
       something like <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ln.1.html">ln(1)</a>).  Please note that the leading slash is
       optional.

       <b>dh_link </b>will generate symlinks that comply with Debian policy -
       absolute when policy says they should be absolute, and relative
       links with as short a path as possible. It will also create any
       subdirectories it needs to put the symlinks in.

       Any pre-existing destination files will be replaced with
       symlinks.

       <b>dh_link </b>also scans the package build tree for existing symlinks
       which do not conform to Debian policy, and corrects them (v4 or
       later).
