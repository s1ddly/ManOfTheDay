              <i>drop</i> - the packet is dropped by the underlying device and
              a copy is not sent to the CPU.

              <i>mirror</i> - the packet is forwarded by the underlying device
              and a copy is sent to the CPU.

   <b>devlink trap group show - display available packet trap groups and</b>
       <b>their attributes</b>
       <i>DEV</i> - specifies the devlink device from which to show packet trap
       groups.  If this argument is omitted all packet trap groups of
       all devices are listed.

       <b>group </b><i>GROUP</i> - specifies the packet trap group.  Only applicable
       if a devlink device is also specified.

   <b>devlink trap group set - set attributes of a packet trap group</b>
