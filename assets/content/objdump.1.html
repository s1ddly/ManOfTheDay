       <b>objdump </b>displays information about one or more object files.  The
       options control what particular information to display.  This
       information is mostly useful to programmers who are working on
       the compilation tools, as opposed to programmers who just want
       their program to compile and work.

       <i>objfile</i>... are the object files to be examined.  When you specify
       archives, <b>objdump </b>shows information on each of the member object
       files.
