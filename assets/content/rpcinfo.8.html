     <b>rpcinfo </b>makes an RPC call to an RPC server and reports what it
     finds.

     In the first synopsis, <b>rpcinfo </b>lists all the registered RPC
     services with <b>rpcbind </b>on <i>host</i>.  If <i>host</i> is not specified, the local
     host is the default.  If <b>-s </b>is used, the information is displayed
     in a concise format.

     In the second synopsis, <b>rpcinfo </b>lists all the RPC services
     registered with <b>rpcbind</b>, version 2.  Also note that the format of
     the information is different in the first and the second synopsis.
     This is because the second synopsis is an older protocol used to
     collect the information displayed (version 2 of the <b>rpcbind</b>
     protocol).

     The third synopsis makes an RPC call to procedure 0 of <i>prognum</i> and
     <i>versnum</i> on the specified <i>host</i> and reports whether a response was
     received.  <i>transport</i> is the transport which has to be used for
     contacting the given service.  The remote address of the service is
     obtained by making a call to the remote <b>rpcbind</b>.

     The <i>prognum</i> argument is a number that represents an RPC program
     number.  If a <i>versnum</i> is specified, <b>rpcinfo </b>attempts to call that
     version of the specified <i>prognum</i>.  Otherwise, <b>rpcinfo </b>attempts to
     find all the registered version numbers for the specified <i>prognum</i>
     by calling version 0, which is presumed not to exist; if it does
     exist, <b>rpcinfo </b>attempts to obtain this information by calling an
     extremely high version number instead, and attempts to call each
     registered version.  Note: the version number is required for <b>-b</b>
     and <b>-d </b>options.
