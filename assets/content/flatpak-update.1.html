       Updates applications and runtimes.  REF is a reference to the
       application or runtime to update. If no REF is given, everything
       is updated, as well as appstream info for all remotes.

       Each REF argument is a full or partial identifier in the flatpak
       ref format, which looks like "(app|runtime)/ID/ARCH/BRANCH". All
       elements except ID are optional and can be left out, including
       the slashes, so most of the time you need only specify ID. Any
       part left out will be matched against what is installed, and if
       there are multiple matches an error message will list the
       alternatives.

       By default this looks for both apps and runtimes with the given
       REF, but you can limit this by using the <b>--app </b>or <b>--runtime</b>
       option, or by supplying the initial element in the REF.

       Normally, this command updates the application to the tip of its
       branch. But it is possible to check out another commit, with the
       <b>--commit </b>option.

       If the configured remote for a ref being updated has a collection
       ID configured on it, flatpak will search mounted filesystems such
       as USB drives as well as Avahi services advertised on the local
       network for the needed refs, in order to support offline updates.
       See <b>ostree-find-remotes</b>(1) for more information.

       Note that updating a runtime is different from installing a
       different branch, and runtime updates are expected to keep strict
       compatibility. If an application update does cause a problem, it
       is possible to go back to the previous version, with the <b>--commit</b>
       option.

       Unless overridden with the <b>--user</b>, <b>--system </b>or <b>--installation</b>
       option, this command updates any matching refs in the standard
       system-wide installation and the per-user one.
