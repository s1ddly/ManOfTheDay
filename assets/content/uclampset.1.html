       <b>uclampset </b>sets or retrieves the utilization clamping attributes
       of an existing <i>PID</i>, or runs <i>command</i> with the given attributes.

       Utilization clamping is a new feature added in v5.3. It gives a
       hint to the scheduler about the allowed range of utilization the
       task should be operating at.

       The utilization of the task affects frequency selection and task
       placement. Only schedutil cpufreq governor understands handling
       util clamp hints at the time of writing. Consult your kernel docs
       for further info about other cpufreq governors support.

       If you’re running on asymmetric heterogeneous system like Arm’s
       big.LITTLE. Utilization clamping can help bias task placement. If
       the task is boosted such that <i>util_min</i> value is higher than the
       little cores' capacity, then the scheduler will do its best to
       place it on a big core.

       Similarly, if <i>util_max</i> is smaller than or equal the capacity of
       the little cores, then the scheduler can still choose to place it
       there even if the actual utilization of the task is at max.

       Setting a task’s <i>uclamp_min</i> to a none zero value will effectively
       boost the task as when it runs it’ll always start from this
       utilization value.

       By setting a task’s <i>uclamp_max</i> below 1024, this will effectively
       cap the task as when it runs it’ll never be able to go above this
       utilization value.

       The full utilization range is: [0:1024]. The special value -1 is
       used to reset to system’s default.
