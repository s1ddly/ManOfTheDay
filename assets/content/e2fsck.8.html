       <b>e2fsck </b>is used to check the ext2/ext3/ext4 family of file
       systems.  For ext3 and ext4 file systems that use a journal, if
       the system has been shut down uncleanly without any errors,
       normally, after replaying the committed transactions  in the
       journal, the file system should be marked as clean.   Hence, for
       file systems that use journaling, <b>e2fsck </b>will normally replay the
       journal and exit, unless its superblock indicates that further
       checking is required.

       <i>device</i> is a block device (e.g., <i>/dev/sdc1</i>) or file containing the
       file system.

       Note that in general it is not safe to run <b>e2fsck </b>on mounted file
       systems.  The only exception is if the <b>-n </b>option is specified,
       and <b>-c</b>, <b>-l</b>, or <b>-L </b>options are <i>not</i> specified.   However, even if
       it is safe to do so, the results printed by <b>e2fsck </b>are not valid
       if the file system is mounted.   If <b>e2fsck </b>asks whether or not
       you should check a file system which is mounted, the only correct
       answer is ``no''.  Only experts who really know what they are
       doing should consider answering this question in any other way.

       If <b>e2fsck </b>is run in interactive mode (meaning that none of <b>-y</b>,
       <b>-n</b>, or <b>-p </b>are specified), the program will ask the user to fix
       each problem found in the file system.  A response of 'y' will
       fix the error; 'n' will leave the error unfixed; and 'a' will fix
       the problem and all subsequent problems; pressing Enter will
       proceed with the default response, which is printed before the
       question mark.  Pressing Control-C terminates e2fsck immediately.
