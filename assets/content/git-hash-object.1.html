<pre>
       Computes the object ID value for an object with specified type
       with the contents of the named file (which can be outside of the
       work tree), and optionally writes the resulting object into the
       object database. Reports its object ID to its standard output.
       When &lt;type&gt; is not specified, it defaults to "blob".
