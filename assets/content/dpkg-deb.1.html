       <b>dpkg-deb </b>packs, unpacks and provides information about Debian
       archives.

       Use <b>dpkg </b>to install and remove packages from your system.

       You can also invoke <b>dpkg-deb </b>by calling <b>dpkg </b>with whatever
       options you want to pass to <b>dpkg-deb</b>. <b>dpkg </b>will spot that you
       wanted <b>dpkg-deb </b>and run it for you.

       For most commands taking an input archive argument, the archive
       can be read from standard input if the archive name is given as a
       single minus character («<b>-</b>»); otherwise lack of support will be
       documented in their respective command description.
