       <b>pmdashping </b>is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
       exports quality of service and response time measurements for
       arbitrary commands as might be run from a shell such as <b>sh</b>(1).

       These measurements are intended to be used to quantify service
       quality and service availability for those services that are
       either mission critical or act as early indicators of adverse
       system performance.

       The sample configuration monitors simple shell commands (<b>exit </b>and
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/date.1.html">date(1)</a>), a short computationally intensive task using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/sum.1.html">sum(1)</a>, a
       short C compilation, DNS lookup via <b>nslookup</b>(1), YP lookup via
       <b>ypcat</b>(1), bind/portmapper service using <b>rpcbind</b>(1), SMTP by
       connecting to telnet port 25 and sending an ``expn root''
       request, and NNTP by connecting to telnet port 119 and running a
       ``listgroup'' command.

       It is expected that other commands would follow the examples in
       the sample configuration file, and most deployments of the
       <b>pmdashping </b>PMDA are expected to use a customized configuration
       file.

       A brief description of the <b>pmdashping </b>command line options
       follows:

       <b>-C   </b>Parse <i>configfile</i>, reporting any errors and exiting with non-
            zero status if the file contains syntactical errors.

       <b>-d   </b>It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics <i>domain</i>
            number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is,
            <i>domain</i> should be different for every PMDA on the one host,
            and the same <i>domain</i> number should be used for the same PMDA
            on all hosts.

       <b>-l   </b>Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
            <i>shping.log</i> is written in the current directory of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a>
            when <b>pmdashping </b>is started, i.e.  <b>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd</b>.  If the
            log file cannot be created or is not writable, output is
            written to the standard error instead.

       <b>-I   </b>Amount of time (in seconds) between subsequent executions of
            the list of commands provided via the configuration file
            <i>configfile</i>.  The default is 2 minutes.

       <b>-t   </b>Amount of time (in seconds) to wait before timing out
            awaiting a response for a command from <i>configfile</i>.  The
            default is 20 seconds.

       <b>-U   </b>User account under which to run the agent and all commands.
            The default is the unprivileged "pcp" account in current
            versions of PCP, but in older versions the superuser account
            ("root") was used by default.

       The required <i>configfile</i> specifies ``tag'' and ``command'' pairs,
       each on a separate line.  All of the commands are run one after
       another, with the whole group rescheduled to be run once per
       <i>interval</i>.  For each command that is run, <b>pmdashping </b>records
       information related to the success (or timeout), exit status,
       elapsed time and CPU time (system and user), and this information
       is exported by the PMDA.  The tags are used to identify the
       individual commands amongst the values exported by the PMDA, and
       form the external instance domain identifiers for the <b>pmdashping</b>
       metrics which relate to each command.
