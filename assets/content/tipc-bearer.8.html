   <b>Bearer identification</b>
       <b>media </b><i>MEDIA</i>
              Specifies the TIPC media type for a particular bearer to
              operate on.  Different media types have different ways of
              identifying a unique bearer.  For example, <b>ib </b>and <b>eth</b>
              identify a bearer with a <i>DEVICE</i> while <b>udp </b>identify a
              bearer with a <i>LOCALIP</i> and a <i>NAME</i>

              <b>ib </b>- Infiniband

              <b>eth </b>- Ethernet

              <b>udp </b>- User Datagram Protocol (UDP)

       <b>name </b><i>NAME</i>
              Logical bearer identifier valid for bearers on <b>udp </b>media.

       <b>device </b><i>DEVICE</i>
              Physical bearer device valid for bearers on <b>eth </b>and <b>ib</b>
              media.

   <b>Bearer properties</b>
       <b>domain</b>
              The addressing domain (region) in which a bearer will
              establish links and accept link establish requests.

       <b>priority</b>
              Default link priority inherited by all links subsequently
              established over a bearer. A single bearer can only host
              one link to a particular node. This means the default link
              priority for a bearer typically affects which bearer to
              use when communicating with a particular node in an multi
              bearer setup. For more info about link priority see
              <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/tipc-link.8.html">tipc-link(8)</a>

       <b>tolerance</b>
              Default link tolerance inherited by all links subsequently
              established over a bearer. For more info about link
              tolerance see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/tipc-link.8.html">tipc-link(8)</a>

       <b>window</b>
              Default link window inherited by all links subsequently
              established over a bearer. For more info about the link
              window size see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/tipc-link.8.html">tipc-link(8)</a>

   <b>UDP bearer options</b>
       <b>localip </b><i>LOCALIP</i>
              Specify a local IP v4/v6 address for a <b>udp </b>bearer.

       <b>localport </b><i>LOCALPORT</i>
              Specify the local port for a <b>udp </b>bearer. The default port
              6118 is used if no port is specified.

       <b>remoteip </b><i>REMOTEIP</i>
              Specify a remote IP for a <b>udp </b>bearer. If no remote IP is
              specified a <b>udp </b>bearer runs in multicast mode and tries to
              auto-discover its neighbours.  The multicast IP address is
              generated based on the TIPC network ID. If a remote IP is
              specified the <b>udp </b>bearer runs in point-to-point mode.

              Multiple <b>remoteip </b>addresses can be added via the <b>bearer</b>
              <b>add </b>command. Adding one or more unicast <b>remoteip </b>addresses
              to an existing <b>udp </b>bearer puts the bearer in replicast
              mode where IP multicast is emulated by sending multiple
              unicast messages to each configured <b>remoteip.  </b>When a peer
              sees a TIPC discovery message from an unknown peer the
              peer address is automatically added to the <b>remoteip</b>
              (replicast) list, thus only one side of a link needs to be
              manually configured. A <b>remoteip </b>address cannot be added to
              a multicast bearer.

       <b>remoteport </b><i>REMOTEPORT</i>
              Specify the remote port for a <b>udp </b>bearer. The default port
              6118 is used if no port is specified.
