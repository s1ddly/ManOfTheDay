       Stochastic Fairness Queueing is a classless queueing discipline
       available for traffic control with the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/tc.8.html">tc(8)</a> command.

       SFQ does not shape traffic but only schedules the transmission of
       packets, based on 'flows'.  The goal is to ensure fairness so
       that each flow is able to send data in turn, thus preventing any
       single flow from drowning out the rest.

       This may in fact have some effect in mitigating a Denial of
       Service attempt.

       SFQ is work-conserving and therefore always delivers a packet if
       it has one available.
