<pre>
       The <i>umask</i> utility shall set the file mode creation mask of the
       current shell execution environment (see <i>Section 2.12</i>, <i>Shell</i>
       <i>Execution Environment</i>) to the value specified by the <i>mask</i>
       operand. This mask shall affect the initial value of the file
       permission bits of subsequently created files. If <i>umask</i> is called
       in a subshell or separate utility execution environment, such as
       one of the following:

           (umask 002)
           nohup umask ...
           find . -exec umask ... \;

       it shall not affect the file mode creation mask of the caller's
       environment.

       If the <i>mask</i> operand is not specified, the <i>umask</i> utility shall
       write to standard output the value of the file mode creation mask
       of the invoking process.
