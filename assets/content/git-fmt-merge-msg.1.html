       Takes the list of merged objects on stdin and produces a suitable
       commit message to be used for the merge commit, usually to be
       passed as the <i>&lt;merge-message&gt;</i> argument of <i>git merge</i>.

       This command is intended mostly for internal use by scripts
       automatically invoking <i>git merge</i>.
