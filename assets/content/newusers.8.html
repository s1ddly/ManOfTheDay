       The <b>newusers </b>command reads a <i>file</i> (or the standard input by
       default) and uses this information to update a set of existing
       users or to create new users. Each line is in the same format as
       the standard password file (see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/passwd.5.html">passwd(5)</a>) with the exceptions
       explained below:

       pw_name:pw_passwd:pw_uid:pw_gid:pw_gecos:pw_dir:pw_shell

       <i>pw_name</i>
           This is the name of the user.

           It can be the name of a new user or the name of an existing
           user (or a user created before by <b>newusers</b>). In case of an
           existing user, the user's information will be changed,
           otherwise a new user will be created.

       <i>pw_passwd</i>
           This field will be encrypted and used as the new value of the
           encrypted password.

       <i>pw_uid</i>
           This field is used to define the UID of the user.

           If the field is empty, a new (unused) UID will be defined
           automatically by <b>newusers</b>.

           If this field contains a number, this number will be used as
           the UID.

           If this field contains the name of an existing user (or the
           name of a user created before by <b>newusers</b>), the UID of the
           specified user will be used.

           If the UID of an existing user is changed, the files
           ownership of the user's file should be fixed manually.

       <i>pw_gid</i>
           This field is used to define the primary group ID for the
           user.

           If this field contains the name of an existing group (or a
           group created before by <b>newusers</b>), the GID of this group will
           be used as the primary group ID for the user.

           If this field is a number, this number will be used as the
           primary group ID of the user. If no groups exist with this
           GID, a new group will be created with this GID, and the name
           of the user.

           If this field is empty, a new group will be created with the
           name of the user and a GID will be automatically defined by
           <b>newusers </b>to be used as the primary group ID for the user and
           as the GID for the new group.

           If this field contains the name of a group which does not
           exist (and was not created before by <b>newusers</b>), a new group
           will be created with the specified name and a GID will be
           automatically defined by <b>newusers </b>to be used as the primary
           group ID for the user and GID for the new group.

       <i>pw_gecos</i>
           This field is copied in the GECOS field of the user.

       <i>pw_dir</i>
           This field is used to define the home directory of the user.

           If this field does not specify an existing directory, the
           specified directory is created, with ownership set to the
           user being created or updated and its primary group. Note
           that <i>newusers does not create parent directories</i> of the new
           user's home directory. The newusers command will fail to
           create the home directory if the parent directories do not
           exist, and will send a message to stderr informing the user
           of the failure. The newusers command will not halt or return
           a failure to the calling shell if it fails to create the home
           directory, it will continue to process the batch of new users
           specified.

           If the home directory of an existing user is changed,
           <b>newusers </b>does not move or copy the content of the old
           directory to the new location. This should be done manually.

       <i>pw_shell</i>
           This field defines the shell of the user. No checks are
           performed on this field.

       <b>newusers </b>first tries to create or change all the specified users,
       and then write these changes to the user or group databases. If
       an error occurs (except in the final writes to the databases), no
       changes are committed to the databases.

       During this first pass, users are created with a locked password
       (and passwords are not changed for the users which are not
       created). A second pass is used to update the passwords using
       PAM. Failures to update a password are reported, but will not
       stop the other password updates.

       This command is intended to be used in a large system environment
       where many accounts are updated at a single time.
