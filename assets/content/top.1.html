       The <b>top </b>program provides a dynamic real-time view of a running
       system.  It can display <b>system </b>summary information as well as a
       list of <b>processes </b>or <b>threads </b>currently being managed by the Linux
       kernel.  The types of system summary information shown and the
       types, order and size of information displayed for processes are
       all user configurable and that configuration can be made
       persistent across restarts.

       The program provides a limited interactive interface for process
       manipulation as well as a much more extensive interface for
       personal configuration  --  encompassing every aspect of its
       operation.  And while <b>top </b>is referred to throughout this
       document, you are free to name the program anything you wish.
       That new name, possibly an alias, will then be reflected on top's
       display and used when reading and writing a configuration file.
