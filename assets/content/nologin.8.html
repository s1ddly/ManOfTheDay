       <b>nologin </b>displays a message that an account is not available and
       exits non-zero. It is intended as a replacement shell field to
       deny login access to an account.

       If the file <i>/etc/nologin.txt</i> exists, <b>nologin </b>displays its
       contents to the user instead of the default message.

       The exit status returned by <b>nologin </b>is always 1.
