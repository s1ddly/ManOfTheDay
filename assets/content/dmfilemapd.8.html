       The dmfilemapd daemon monitors groups of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/dmstats.8.html">dmstats(8)</a> regions that
       correspond to the extents of a file, adding and removing regions
       to reflect the changing state of the file on-disk.

       The daemon is normally launched automatically by the <b>dmstats</b>
       <b>create </b>command, but can be run manually, either to create a new
       daemon where one did not previously exist, or to change the
       options previously used, by killing the existing daemon and
       starting a new one.
