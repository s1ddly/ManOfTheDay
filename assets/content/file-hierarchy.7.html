       Operating systems using the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/systemd.1.html">systemd(1)</a> system and service manager
       are organized based on a file system hierarchy inspired by UNIX,
       more specifically the hierarchy described in the <b>File System</b>
       <b>Hierarchy</b><b></b>[1] specification and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/hier.7.html">hier(7)</a>, with various extensions,
       partially documented in the <b>XDG Base Directory Specification</b><b></b>[2]
       and <b>XDG User Directories</b><b></b>[3]. This manual page describes a more
       generalized, though minimal and modernized subset of these
       specifications that defines more strictly the suggestions and
       restrictions systemd makes on the file system hierarchy.

       Many of the paths described here can be queried with the
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/systemd-path.1.html">systemd-path(1)</a> tool.
