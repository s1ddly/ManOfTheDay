       <i>Gawk</i> is the GNU Project's implementation of the AWK programming
       language.  It conforms to the definition of the language in the
       POSIX 1003.1 standard.  This version in turn is based on the
       description in <i>The AWK Programming Language</i>, by Aho, Kernighan,
       and Weinberger.  <i>Gawk</i> provides the additional features found in
       the current version of Brian Kernighan's <i>awk</i> and numerous GNU-
       specific extensions.

       The command line consists of options to <i>gawk</i> itself, the AWK
       program text (if not supplied via the <b>-f </b>or <b>--include </b>options),
       and values to be made available in the <b>ARGC </b>and <b>ARGV </b>pre-defined
       AWK variables.

       When <i>gawk</i> is invoked with the <b>--profile </b>option, it starts
       gathering profiling statistics from the execution of the program.
       <i>Gawk</i> runs more slowly in this mode, and automatically produces an
       execution profile in the file <b>awkprof.out </b>when done.  See the
       <b>--profile </b>option, below.

       <i>Gawk</i> also has an integrated debugger. An interactive debugging
       session can be started by supplying the <b>--debug </b>option to the
       command line. In this mode of execution, <i>gawk</i> loads the AWK
       source code and then prompts for debugging commands.  <i>Gawk</i> can
       only debug AWK program source provided with the <b>-f </b>and <b>--include</b>
       options.  The debugger is documented in <i>GAWK: Effective AWK</i>
       <i>Programming</i>.
