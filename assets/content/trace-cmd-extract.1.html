       The trace-cmd(1) extract is usually used after <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/trace-cmd-start.1.html">trace-cmd-start(1)</a>
       and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/trace-cmd-stop.1.html">trace-cmd-stop(1)</a>. It can be used after the Ftrace tracer has
       been started manually through the Ftrace pseudo file system.

       The extract command creates a trace.dat file that can be used by
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/trace-cmd-report.1.html">trace-cmd-report(1)</a> to read from. It reads the kernel internal
       ring buffer to produce the trace.dat file.
