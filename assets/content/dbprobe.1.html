       The <b>dbprobe </b>utility is used by <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmdadbping.1.html">pmdadbping(1)</a> to measure response
       time from a database.  A given query is executed on the database
       at the requested interval (<i>delay</i>, which defaults to 60 seconds).
       This response time measure can be exported via the Performance
       Co-Pilot framework for live and historical monitoring using
       <i>pmdadbping</i>(1).
