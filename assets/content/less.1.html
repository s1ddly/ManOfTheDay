       <i>Less</i> is a program similar to <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/more.1.html">more(1)</a>, but which allows backward
       movement in the file as well as forward movement.  Also, <i>less</i>
       does not have to read the entire input file before starting, so
       with large input files it starts up faster than text editors like
       <b>vi</b>(1).  <i>Less</i> uses termcap (or terminfo on some systems), so it
       can run on a variety of terminals.  There is even limited support
       for hardcopy terminals.  (On a hardcopy terminal, lines which
       should be printed at the top of the screen are prefixed with a
       caret.)

       Commands are based on both <i>more</i> and <i>vi</i>.  Commands may be preceded
       by a decimal number, called N in the descriptions below.  The
       number is used by some commands, as indicated.
