       <b>fsck.btrfs </b>is a type of utility that should exist for any
       filesystem and is called during system setup when the
       corresponding <b>/etc/fstab </b>entries contain non-zero value for
       <b>fs_passno</b>, see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/fstab.5.html">fstab(5)</a> for more.

       Traditional filesystems need to run their respective fsck utility
       in case the filesystem was not unmounted cleanly and the log
       needs to be replayed before mount. This is not needed for BTRFS.
       You should set fs_passno to 0.

       If you wish to check the consistency of a BTRFS filesystem or
       repair a damaged filesystem, see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/btrfs-check.8.html">btrfs-check(8)</a>. By default
       filesystem consistency is checked, the repair mode is enabled via
       the <i>--repair</i> option (use with care!).
