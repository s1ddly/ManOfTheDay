       <b>pmdasample </b>is a sample Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA)
       which exports a variety of synthetic performance metrics.

       This PMDA was developed as part of the quality assurance testing
       for the PCP product, but has other uses, most notably in the
       development of new PCP clients.

       The metrics exported by the sample PMDA cover the full range of
       data types, data semantics, value cardinality, instance domain
       stability and error conditions found in real PMDAs.

       A brief description of the <b>pmdasample </b>command line options
       follows:

       <b>-d   </b>It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics <i>domain</i>
            number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is,
            <i>domain</i> should be different for every PMDA on the one host,
            and the same <i>domain</i> number should be used for the same PMDA
            on all hosts.

       <b>-i   </b>Expect PMCD to connect to <b>pmdasample </b>on the specified TCP/IP
            port.  <i>port</i> may be a port number or port name.

       <b>-l   </b>Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
            <i>sample.log</i> is written in the current directory of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a>
            when <b>pmdasample </b>is started, i.e.  <b>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd</b>.  If the
            log file cannot be created or is not writable, output is
            written to the standard error instead.

       <b>-p   </b>Expect PMCD to create a pipe and the connection to
            <b>pmdasample </b>is via standard input and standard output.  This
            is the default connection mode.

       <b>-u   </b>Expect PMCD to connect to <b>pmdasample </b>on the Unix domain
            socket named <i>socket</i>.

       <b>-U   </b>User account under which to run the agent.  The default is
            the unprivileged "pcp" account in current versions of PCP,
            but in older versions the superuser account ("root") was
            used by default.

       At most one of the options <b>-i</b>, <b>-p </b>and <b>-u </b>may be specified.
