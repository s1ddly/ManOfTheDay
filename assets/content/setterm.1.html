       <b>setterm </b>writes to standard output a character string that will
       invoke the specified terminal capabilities. Where possible
       <i>terminfo</i> is consulted to find the string to use. Some options
       however (marked "virtual consoles only" below) do not correspond
       to a <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/terminfo.5.html">terminfo(5)</a> capability. In this case, if the terminal type
       is "con" or "linux" the string that invokes the specified
       capabilities on the PC Minix virtual console driver is output.
       Options that are not implemented by the terminal are ignored.
