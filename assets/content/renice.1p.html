<pre>
       The <i>renice</i> utility shall request that the nice values (see the
       Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‚Äê2017, <i>Section 3.244</i>, <i>Nice</i>
       <i>Value</i>) of one or more running processes be changed. By default,
       the applicable processes are specified by their process IDs. When
       a process group is specified (see <b>-g</b>), the request shall apply to
       all processes in the process group.

       The nice value shall be bounded in an implementation-defined
       manner.  If the requested <i>increment</i> would raise or lower the nice
       value of the executed utility beyond implementation-defined
       limits, then the limit whose value was exceeded shall be used.

       When a user is <i>renice</i>d, the request applies to all processes
       whose saved set-user-ID matches the user ID corresponding to the
       user.

       Regardless of which options are supplied or any other factor,
       <i>renice</i> shall not alter the nice values of any process unless the
       user requesting such a change has appropriate privileges to do so
       for the specified process. If the user lacks appropriate
       privileges to perform the requested action, the utility shall
       return an error status.

       The saved set-user-ID of the user's process shall be checked
       instead of its effective user ID when <i>renice</i> attempts to
       determine the user ID of the process in order to determine
       whether the user has appropriate privileges.
