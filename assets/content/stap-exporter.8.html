       <i>stap-exporter</i> runs a set of systemtap scripts and relays their
       procfs outputs to remote HTTP clients on demand.  This makes
       systemtap scripts directly usable as individual prometheus
       exporters.  This is assisted by a set of macros provided in the
       <b>prometheus.stpm </b>tapset file.
