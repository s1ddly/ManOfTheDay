       The pam_wheel PAM module is used to enforce the so-called <i>wheel</i>
       group. By default it permits root access to the system if the
       applicant user is a member of the <i>wheel</i> group. If no group with
       this name exist, the module is using the group with the group-ID
       <b>0</b>.
