       <b>dh_auto_configure </b>is a debhelper program that tries to
       automatically configure a package prior to building. It does so
       by running the appropriate command for the build system it
       detects the package uses.  For example, it looks for and runs a
       <i>./configure</i> script, <i>Makefile.PL</i>, <i>Build.PL</i>, or <i>cmake</i>. A standard
       set of parameters is determined and passed to the program that is
       run. Some build systems, such as make, do not need a configure
       step; for these <b>dh_auto_configure </b>will exit without doing
       anything.

       This is intended to work for about 90% of packages. If it doesn't
       work, you're encouraged to skip using <b>dh_auto_configure </b>at all,
       and just run <i>./configure</i> or its equivalent manually.
