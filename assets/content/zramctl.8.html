       <b>zramctl </b>is used to quickly set up zram device parameters, to
       reset zram devices, and to query the status of used zram devices.

       If no option is given, all non-zero size zram devices are shown.

       Note that <i>zramdev</i> node specified on command line has to already
       exist. The command <b>zramctl </b>creates a new <i>/dev/zram&lt;N&gt;</i> nodes only
       when <b>--find </b>option specified. Itâ€™s possible (and common) that
       after system boot <i>/dev/zram&lt;N&gt;</i> nodes are not created yet.
