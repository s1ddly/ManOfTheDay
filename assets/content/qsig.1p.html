       To signal a batch job is to send a signal to the session leader
       of the batch job. A batch job is signaled by sending a request to
       the batch server that manages the batch job. The <i>qsig</i> utility is
       a user-accessible batch client that requests the signaling of a
       batch job.

       The <i>qsig</i> utility shall signal those batch jobs for which a batch
       <i>job_identifier</i> is presented to the utility. The <i>qsig</i> utility
       shall not signal any batch jobs whose batch <i>job_identifier</i>s are
       not presented to the utility.

       The <i>qsig</i> utility shall signal batch jobs in the order in which
       the corresponding batch <i>job_identifier</i>s are presented to the
       utility. If the <i>qsig</i> utility fails to process a batch
       <i>job_identifier</i> successfully, the utility shall proceed to process
       the remaining batch <i>job_identifier</i>s, if any.

       The <i>qsig</i> utility shall signal batch jobs by sending a <i>Signal Job</i>
       <i>Request</i> to the batch server that manages the batch job.

       For each successfully processed batch <i>job_identifier</i>, the <i>qsig</i>
       utility shall have received a completion reply to each <i>Signal Job</i>
       <i>Request</i> sent to a batch server at the time the utility exits.
