<pre>
       These errors and warnings occur when the kernel systemtap is
       running on lacks support for user-space process tracking
       facilities.

   <b>COMPILE-TIME ERROR</b>
       The error

              ERROR: user-space process-tracking facilities not available

       occurs when the script contains a uprobes probe point that the
       current kernel does not support.

   <b>RUNTIME WARNINGS</b>
       The warning,

              WARNING: process-tracking facilities are not available in this kernel

       and the related message,

              WARNING: cannot track target in process '...'

       both occur at runtime when running on a kernel (generally an
       older version) that has neither utrace functionality nor an
       acceptable substitute.

       The script should still load and run. However, probes that rely
       on availability of process-tracking facilities will silently fail
       to trigger.
