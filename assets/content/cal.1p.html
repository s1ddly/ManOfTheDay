       The <i>cal</i> utility shall write a calendar to standard output using
       the Julian calendar for dates from January 1, 1 through September
       2, 1752 and the Gregorian calendar for dates from September 14,
       1752 through December 31, 9999 as though the Gregorian calendar
       had been adopted on September 14, 1752.

       If no operands are given, <i>cal</i> shall produce a one-month calendar
       for the current month in the current year. If only the <i>year</i>
       operand is given, <i>cal</i> shall produce a calendar for all twelve
       months in the given calendar year. If both <i>month</i> and <i>year</i>
       operands are given, <i>cal</i> shall produce a one-month calendar for
       the given month in the given year.
