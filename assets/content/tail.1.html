       Print the last 10 lines of each FILE to standard output.  With
       more than one FILE, precede each with a header giving the file
       name.

       With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short
       options too.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--bytes</b>=<i>[</i>+]NUM
              output the last NUM bytes; or use <b>-c </b>+NUM to output
              starting with byte NUM of each file

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--follow[=</b>{name|descriptor}]
              output appended data as the file grows;

              an absent option argument means 'descriptor'

       <b>-F     </b>same as <b>--follow</b>=<i>name</i> <b>--retry</b>

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--lines</b>=<i>[</i>+]NUM
              output the last NUM lines, instead of the last 10; or use
              <b>-n </b>+NUM to output starting with line NUM

       <b>--max-unchanged-stats</b>=<i>N</i>
              with <b>--follow</b>=<i>name</i>, reopen a FILE which has not

              changed size after N (default 5) iterations to see if it
              has been unlinked or renamed (this is the usual case of
              rotated log files); with inotify, this option is rarely
              useful

       <b>--pid</b>=<i>PID</i>
              with <b>-f</b>, terminate after process ID, PID dies

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--quiet</b>, <b>--silent</b>
              never output headers giving file names

       <b>--retry</b>
              keep trying to open a file if it is inaccessible

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--sleep-interval</b>=<i>N</i>
              with <b>-f</b>, sleep for approximately N seconds (default 1.0)
              between iterations; with inotify and <b>--pid</b>=<i>P</i>, check
              process P at least once every N seconds

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              always output headers giving file names

       <b>-z</b>, <b>--zero-terminated</b>
              line delimiter is NUL, not newline

       <b>--help </b>display this help and exit

       <b>--version</b>
              output version information and exit

       NUM may have a multiplier suffix: b 512, kB 1000, K 1024, MB
       1000*1000, M 1024*1024, GB 1000*1000*1000, G 1024*1024*1024, and
       so on for T, P, E, Z, Y.  Binary prefixes can be used, too:
       KiB=K, MiB=M, and so on.

       With <b>--follow </b>(<b>-f</b>), tail defaults to following the file
       descriptor, which means that even if a tail'ed file is renamed,
       tail will continue to track its end.  This default behavior is
       not desirable when you really want to track the actual name of
       the file, not the file descriptor (e.g., log rotation).  Use
       <b>--follow</b>=<i>name</i> in that case.  That causes tail to track the named
       file in a way that accommodates renaming, removal and creation.
