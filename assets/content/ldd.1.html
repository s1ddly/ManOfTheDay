       <b>ldd </b>prints the shared objects (shared libraries) required by each
       program or shared object specified on the command line.  An
       example of its use and output is the following:

           $ <b>ldd /bin/ls</b>
               linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffcc3563000)
               libselinux.so.1 =&gt; /lib64/libselinux.so.1 (0x00007f87e5459000)
               libcap.so.2 =&gt; /lib64/libcap.so.2 (0x00007f87e5254000)
               libc.so.6 =&gt; /lib64/libc.so.6 (0x00007f87e4e92000)
               libpcre.so.1 =&gt; /lib64/libpcre.so.1 (0x00007f87e4c22000)
               libdl.so.2 =&gt; /lib64/libdl.so.2 (0x00007f87e4a1e000)
               /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00005574bf12e000)
               libattr.so.1 =&gt; /lib64/libattr.so.1 (0x00007f87e4817000)
               libpthread.so.0 =&gt; /lib64/libpthread.so.0 (0x00007f87e45fa000)

       In the usual case, <b>ldd </b>invokes the standard dynamic linker (see
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ld.so.8.html">ld.so(8)</a>) with the <b>LD_TRACE_LOADED_OBJECTS </b>environment variable
       set to 1.  This causes the dynamic linker to inspect the
       program's dynamic dependencies, and find (according to the rules
       described in <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ld.so.8.html">ld.so(8)</a>) and load the objects that satisfy those
       dependencies.  For each dependency, <b>ldd </b>displays the location of
       the matching object and the (hexadecimal) address at which it is
       loaded.  (The <i>linux-vdso</i> and <i>ld-linux</i> shared dependencies are
       special; see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/vdso.7.html">vdso(7)</a> and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ld.so.8.html">ld.so(8)</a>.)

   <b>Security</b>
       Be aware that in some circumstances (e.g., where the program
       specifies an ELF interpreter other than <i>ld-linux.so</i>), some
       versions of <b>ldd </b>may attempt to obtain the dependency information
       by attempting to directly execute the program, which may lead to
       the execution of whatever code is defined in the program's ELF
       interpreter, and perhaps to execution of the program itself.  (In
       glibc versions before 2.27, the upstream <b>ldd </b>implementation did
       this for example, although most distributions provided a modified
       version that did not.)

       Thus, you should <i>never</i> employ <b>ldd </b>on an untrusted executable,
       since this may result in the execution of arbitrary code.  A
       safer alternative when dealing with untrusted executables is:

           $ <b>objdump -p /path/to/program | grep NEEDED</b>

       Note, however, that this alternative shows only the direct
       dependencies of the executable, while <b>ldd </b>shows the entire
       dependency tree of the executable.
