<pre>
       The <i>df</i> utility shall write the amount of available space and file
       slots for file systems on which the invoking user has appropriate
       read access. File systems shall be specified by the <i>file</i>
       operands; when none are specified, information shall be written
       for all file systems. The format of the default output from <i>df</i> is
       unspecified, but all space figures are reported in 512-byte
       units, unless the <b>-k </b>option is specified. This output shall
       contain at least the file system names, amount of available space
       on each of these file systems, and, if no options other than <b>-t</b>
       are specified, the number of free file slots, or <i>inode</i>s,
       available; when <b>-t </b>is specified, the output shall contain the
       total allocated space as well.
