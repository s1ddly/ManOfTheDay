       Intel Processor Trace (Intel PT) is an extension of Intel
       Architecture that collects information about software execution
       such as control flow, execution modes and timings and formats it
       into highly compressed binary packets. Technical details are
       documented in the Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software
       Developer Manuals, Chapter 36 Intel Processor Trace.

       Intel PT is first supported in Intel Core M and 5th generation
       Intel Core processors that are based on the Intel
       micro-architecture code name Broadwell.

       Trace data is collected by <i>perf record</i> and stored within the
       perf.data file. See below for options to <i>perf record</i>.

       Trace data must be <i>decoded</i> which involves walking the object code
       and matching the trace data packets. For example a TNT packet
       only tells whether a conditional branch was taken or not taken,
       so to make use of that packet the decoder must know precisely
       which instruction was being executed.

       Decoding is done on-the-fly. The decoder outputs samples in the
       same format as samples output by perf hardware events, for
       example as though the "instructions" or "branches" events had
       been recorded. Presently 3 tools support this: <i>perf script</i>, <i>perf</i>
       <i>report</i> and <i>perf inject</i>. See below for more information on using
       those tools.

       The main distinguishing feature of Intel PT is that the decoder
       can determine the exact flow of software execution. Intel PT can
       be used to understand why and how did software get to a certain
       point, or behave a certain way. The software does not have to be
       recompiled, so Intel PT works with debug or release builds,
       however the executed images are needed - which makes use in
       JIT-compiled environments, or with self-modified code, a
       challenge. Also symbols need to be provided to make sense of
       addresses.

       A limitation of Intel PT is that it produces huge amounts of
       trace data (hundreds of megabytes per second per core) which
       takes a long time to decode, for example two or three orders of
       magnitude longer than it took to collect. Another limitation is
       the performance impact of tracing, something that will vary
       depending on the use-case and architecture.
