       In a nutshell, <i>pam_timestamp</i> caches successful authentication
       attempts, and allows you to use a recent successful attempt as
       the basis for authentication. This is similar mechanism which is
       used in <b>sudo</b>.

       When an application opens a session using <i>pam_timestamp</i>, a
       timestamp file is created in the <i>timestampdir</i> directory for the
       user. When an application attempts to authenticate the user, a
       <i>pam_timestamp</i> will treat a sufficiently recent timestamp file as
       grounds for succeeding.
