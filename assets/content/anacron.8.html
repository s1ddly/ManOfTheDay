       <b>Anacron </b>is used to execute commands periodically, with a
       frequency specified in days.  Unlike <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/cron.8.html">cron(8)</a>, it does not assume
       that the machine is running continuously.  Hence, it can be used
       on machines that are not running 24 hours a day to control
       regular jobs as daily, weekly, and monthly jobs.

       Anacron reads a list of jobs from the <i>/etc/anacrontab</i>
       configuration file (see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/anacrontab.5.html">anacrontab(5)</a>).  This file contains the
       list of jobs that Anacron controls.  Each job entry specifies a
       period in days, a delay in minutes, a unique job identifier, and
       a shell command.

       For each job, Anacron checks whether this job has been executed
       in the last <b>n </b>days, where <b>n </b>is the time period specified for that
       job.  If a job has not been executed in <b>n </b>days or more, Anacron
       runs the job's shell command, after waiting for the number of
       minutes specified as the delay parameter.

       After the command exits, Anacron records the date (excludes the
       hour) in a special timestamp file for that job, so it knows when
       to execute that job again.

       When there are no more jobs to be run, Anacron exits.

       Anacron only considers jobs whose identifier, as specified in
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/anacrontab.5.html">anacrontab(5)</a>, matches any of the <i>job</i> command-line arguments.
       The <i>job</i> command-line arguments can be represented by shell
       wildcard patterns (be sure to protect them from your shell with
       adequate quoting).  Specifying no <i>job</i> command-line arguments is
       equivalent to specifying "*"  (that is, all jobs are considered
       by Anacron).

       Unless Anacron is run with the <b>-d </b>option (specified below), it
       forks to the background when it starts, and any parent processes
       exit immediately.

       Unless Anacron is run with the <b>-s </b>or <b>-n </b>options, it starts jobs
       immediately when their delay is over.  The execution of different
       jobs is completely independent.

       If an executed job generates any output to standard output or to
       standard error, the output is mailed to the user under whom
       Anacron is running (usually root), or to the address specified in
       the <b>MAILTO </b>environment variable in the <i>/etc/anacrontab</i> file, if
       such exists.  If the <b>LOGNAME </b>environment variable is set, it is
       used in the From: field of the mail.

       Any informative messages generated by Anacron are sent to
       <b>syslogd</b>(8) or <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/rsyslogd.8.html">rsyslogd(8)</a> under with facility set to <b>cron </b>and
       priority set to <b>notice</b>.  Any error messages are sent with the
       priority <b>error</b>.

       "Active" jobs (i.e., jobs that Anacron already decided to run and
       are now waiting for their delay to pass, and jobs that are
       currently being executed by Anacron), are "locked", so that other
       copies of Anacron cannot run them at the same time.
