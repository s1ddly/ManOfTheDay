       <b>dh_installsystemduser </b>finds the systemd user instance service
       files installed by a package and generates <i>postinst</i>, and <i>prerm</i>
       code blocks for enabling and disabling the corresponding systemd
       user instance services, when the package is installed, updated,
       or removed. These snippets are added to the maintainer scripts by
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dh_installdeb.1.html">dh_installdeb(1)</a>.

       <b>deb-systemd-helper</b>(1) is used to enable and disable the systemd
       units, thus it is not necessary that the machine actually runs
       systemd during package installation time, enabling happens on all
       machines.

       <b>dh_installsystemduser </b>operates on all user instance unit files
       installed by a package. For only generating blocks for specific
       unit files, pass them as arguments. Specific unit files can be
       excluded from processing using the <b>-X </b>common <b>debhelper</b>(1) option.
