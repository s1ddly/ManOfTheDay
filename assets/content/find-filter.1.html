       <b>find-filter </b>is a filter for a list of file names read on standard
       input, and if the files match the <i>predicate</i> their names are
       written on standard output.

       The supported <i>predicate</i> forms are based on the file's creation
       time or modification time, and take the form <b>ctime </b>or <b>mtime</b>
       followed by a time specification.  A time specification takes the
       form of a <b>+ </b>or <b>- </b>followed by days (a non-negative integer),
       optionally followed by a colon (<b>:</b>) and hours (an integer in the
       range 0 to 23), optionally followed by another colon (<b>:</b>) and
       minutes (an integer in the range 0 to 59).

       The semantics of the time specification are that a file matches
       the predicate if the chosen time attribute for the file is <i>less</i>
       <i>than</i> (<b>+</b>) the current time minus the time specification, else <i>more</i>
       <i>than or equal to</i> (<b>-</b>) the current time minus the time
       specification.  Alternatively, <b>+ </b>means <i>before</i> the current time
       minus the time specification, and <b>- </b>means <i>at</i> or <i>after</i> the current
       time minus the time specification.

       <b>find-filter </b>is intended to be used to provide finer-grain and
       platform independent selection compared to the <b>-mtime </b>or <b>-ctime</b>
       options of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/find.1.html">find(1)</a>.  <b>find-filter </b>is expected to be used as a
       post-filter for the output from <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/find.1.html">find(1)</a>, and this is how it is
       used in the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmlogger_daily.1.html">pmlogger_daily(1)</a> scripts to select files to be
       compressed or culled.
