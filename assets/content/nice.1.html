       Run COMMAND with an adjusted niceness, which affects process
       scheduling.  With no COMMAND, print the current niceness.
       Niceness values range from <b>-20 </b>(most favorable to the process) to
       19 (least favorable to the process).

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short
       options too.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--adjustment</b>=<i>N</i>
              add integer N to the niceness (default 10)

       <b>--help </b>display this help and exit

       <b>--version</b>
              output version information and exit

       NOTE: your shell may have its own version of nice, which usually
       supersedes the version described here.  Please refer to your
       shell's documentation for details about the options it supports.
