       <b>dbpmda </b>is an interactive interface to the interactions between a
       Performance Metric Domain Agent (<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/PMDA.3.html">PMDA(3)</a>) and the Performance
       Metric Collector Daemon (<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a>).  This allows PMDAs to be
       attached, initialized and exercised to test for correctness.

       <b>dbpmda </b>interactively prompts the user for commands, many of which
       emulate the Protocol Data Units (PDUs) that may be sent by a
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> process.  After running <b>dbpmda</b>, enter the command <b>help </b>to
       get a list of the available commands.  The example section below
       illustrates a session using <b>dbpmda </b>to test a PMDA.

       To simplify repetitive testing of a PMDA, the file <i>.dbpmdarc</i> in
       the current working directory can contain a list of commands that
       will be executed by <b>dbpmda </b>on startup, before the user is
       prompted to enter further commands interactively.  While
       processing the <i>.dbpmdarc</i> file, interactive mode and command
       echoing are enabled and then reset at the end of the <i>.dbpmdarc</i>
       file (see the <b>-i </b>and <b>-e </b>command line options below).

       The <b>-f </b>command line option prevents startup processing of a
       <i>.dbpmdarc</i> file (if it exists).

       If the system supports <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/readline.3.html">readline(3)</a> then this will be used to read
       commands when input is from a tty device, so history and command
       line editing are available.

       As there are no timeout constraints on a PMDA while using <b>dbpmda</b>
       (as compared to <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a>), another debugger like <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/gdb.1.html">gdb(1)</a> can be
       used on the PMDA process once it has been attached to <b>dbpmda</b>.
