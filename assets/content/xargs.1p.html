       The <i>xargs</i> utility shall construct a command line consisting of
       the <i>utility</i> and <i>argument</i> operands specified followed by as many
       arguments read in sequence from standard input as fit in length
       and number constraints specified by the options. The <i>xargs</i>
       utility shall then invoke the constructed command line and wait
       for its completion. This sequence shall be repeated until one of
       the following occurs:

        *  An end-of-file condition is detected on standard input.

        *  An argument consisting of just the logical end-of-file string
           (see the <b>-E </b><i>eofstr</i> option) is found on standard input after
           double-quote processing, &lt;apostrophe&gt; processing, and
           &lt;backslash&gt;-escape processing (see next paragraph). All
           arguments up to but not including the argument consisting of
           just the logical end-of-file string shall be used as
           arguments in constructed command lines.

        *  An invocation of a constructed command line returns an exit
           status of 255.

       The application shall ensure that arguments in the standard input
       are separated by unquoted &lt;blank&gt; characters, unescaped &lt;blank&gt;
       characters, or &lt;newline&gt; characters. A string of zero or more
       non-double-quote (<b>'"'</b>) characters and non-&lt;newline&gt; characters
       can be quoted by enclosing them in double-quotes. A string of
       zero or more non-&lt;apostrophe&gt; (<b>'\''</b>) characters and non-&lt;newline&gt;
       characters can be quoted by enclosing them in &lt;apostrophe&gt;
       characters. Any unquoted character can be escaped by preceding it
       with a &lt;backslash&gt;.  The utility named by <i>utility</i> shall be
       executed one or more times until the end-of-file is reached or
       the logical end-of file string is found. The results are
       unspecified if the utility named by <i>utility</i> attempts to read from
       its standard input.

       The generated command line length shall be the sum of the size in
       bytes of the utility name and each argument treated as strings,
       including a null byte terminator for each of these strings. The
       <i>xargs</i> utility shall limit the command line length such that when
       the command line is invoked, the combined argument and
       environment lists (see the <i>exec</i> family of functions in the System
       Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‚Äê2017) shall not exceed
       {ARG_MAX}-2048 bytes. Within this constraint, if neither the <b>-n</b>
       nor the <b>-s </b>option is specified, the default command line length
       shall be at least {LINE_MAX}.
