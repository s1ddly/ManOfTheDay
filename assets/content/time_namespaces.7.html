       Time namespaces virtualize the values of two system clocks:

       • <b>CLOCK_MONOTONIC </b>(and likewise <b>CLOCK_MONOTONIC_COARSE </b>and
         <b>CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW</b>), a nonsettable clock that represents
         monotonic time  since—as described  by  POSIX—"some
         unspecified  point in the past".

       • <b>CLOCK_BOOTTIME </b>(and likewise <b>CLOCK_BOOTTIME_ALARM</b>), a
         nonsettable clock that is identical to <b>CLOCK_MONOTONIC</b>, except
         that it also includes any time that the system is suspended.

       Thus, the processes in a time namespace share per-namespace
       values for these clocks.  This affects various APIs that measure
       against these clocks, including: <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/clock_gettime.2.html">clock_gettime(2)</a>,
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/clock_nanosleep.2.html">clock_nanosleep(2)</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/nanosleep.2.html">nanosleep(2)</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/timer_settime.2.html">timer_settime(2)</a>,
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/timerfd_settime.2.html">timerfd_settime(2)</a>, and <i>/proc/uptime</i>.

       Currently, the only way to create a time namespace is by calling
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/unshare.2.html">unshare(2)</a> with the <b>CLONE_NEWTIME </b>flag.  This call creates a new
       time namespace but does <i>not</i> place the calling process in the new
       namespace.  Instead, the calling process's subsequently created
       children are placed in the new namespace.  This allows clock
       offsets (see below) for the new namespace to be set before the
       first process is placed in the namespace.  The
       <i>/proc/[pid]/ns/time_for_children</i> symbolic link shows the time
       namespace in which the children of a process will be created.  (A
       process can use a file descriptor opened on this symbolic link in
       a call to <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setns.2.html">setns(2)</a> in order to move into the namespace.)

   <b>/proc/PID/timens_offsets</b>
       Associated with each time namespace are offsets, expressed with
       respect to the initial time namespace, that define the values of
       the monotonic and boot-time clocks in that namespace.  These
       offsets are exposed via the file <i>/proc/PID/timens_offsets</i>.
       Within this file, the offsets are expressed as lines consisting
       of three space-delimited fields:

           &lt;clock-id&gt; &lt;offset-secs&gt; &lt;offset-nanosecs&gt;

       The <i>clock-id</i> is a string that identifies the clock whose offsets
       are being shown.  This field is either <i>monotonic</i>, for
       <b>CLOCK_MONOTONIC</b>, or <i>boottime</i>, for <b>CLOCK_BOOTTIME</b>.  The remaining
       fields express the offset (seconds plus nanoseconds) for the
       clock in this time namespace.  These offsets are expressed
       relative to the clock values in the initial time namespace.  The
       <i>offset-secs</i> value can be negative, subject to restrictions noted
       below; <i>offset-nanosecs</i> is an unsigned value.

       In the initial time namespace, the contents of the <i>timens_offsets</i>
       file are as follows:

           $ <b>cat /proc/self/timens_offsets</b>
           monotonic           0         0
           boottime            0         0

       In a new time namespace that has had no member processes, the
       clock offsets can be modified by writing newline-terminated
       records of the same form to the <i>timens_offsets</i> file.  The file
       can be written to multiple times, but after the first process has
       been created in or has entered the namespace, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/write.2.html">write(2)</a>s on this
       file fail with the error <b>EACCES</b>.  In order to write to the
       <i>timens_offsets</i> file, a process must have the <b>CAP_SYS_TIME</b>
       capability in the user namespace that owns the time namespace.

       Writes to the <i>timens_offsets</i> file can fail with the following
       errors:

       <b>EINVAL </b>An <i>offset-nanosecs</i> value is greater than 999,999,999.

       <b>EINVAL </b>A <i>clock-id</i> value is not valid.

       <b>EPERM  </b>The caller does not have the <b>CAP_SYS_TIME </b>capability.

       <b>ERANGE </b>An <i>offset-secs</i> value is out of range.  In particular;

              • <i>offset-secs</i> can't be set to a value which would make the
                current time on the corresponding clock inside the
                namespace a negative value; and

              • <i>offset-secs</i> can't be set to a value such that the time
                on the corresponding clock inside the namespace would
                exceed half of the value of the kernel constant
                <b>KTIME_SEC_MAX </b>(this limits the clock value to a maximum
                of approximately 146 years).

       In a new time namespace created by <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/unshare.2.html">unshare(2)</a>, the contents of
       the <i>timens_offsets</i> file are inherited from the time namespace of
       the creating process.
