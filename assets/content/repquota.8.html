       <b>repquota </b>prints a summary of the disc usage and quotas for the
       specified file systems.  For each user the current number of
       files and amount of space (in kilobytes) is printed, along with
       any quota limits set with <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/edquota.8.html">edquota(8)</a> or <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/setquota.8.html">setquota(8)</a>.  In the
       second column repquota prints two characters marking which limits
       are exceeded. If user is over his space softlimit or reaches his
       space hardlimit in case softlimit is unset, the first character
       is '+'. Otherwise the character printed is '-'. The second
       character denotes the state of inode usage analogously.

       <b>repquota </b>has to translate ids of all users/groups/projects to
       names (unless option <b>-n </b>was specified) so it may take a while to
       print all the information. To make translating as fast as
       possible <b>repquota </b>tries to detect (by reading <b>/etc/nsswitch.conf</b>)
       whether entries are stored in standard plain text file or in a
       database and either translates chunks of 1024 names or each name
       individually. You can override this autodetection by <b>-c </b>or <b>-C</b>
       options.
