       The <i>touch</i> utility shall change the last data modification
       timestamps, the last data access timestamps, or both.

       The time used can be specified by the <b>-t </b><i>time</i> option-argument,
       the corresponding <i>time</i> fields of the file referenced by the <b>-r</b>
       <i>ref_file</i> option-argument, or the <b>-d </b><i>date_time</i> option-argument, as
       specified in the following sections. If none of these are
       specified, <i>touch</i> shall use the current time.

       For each <i>file</i> operand, <i>touch</i> shall perform actions equivalent to
       the following functions defined in the System Interfaces volume
       of POSIX.1‚Äê2017:

        1. If <i>file</i> does not exist:

            a. The <i>creat</i>() function is called with the following
               arguments:

               --  The <i>file</i> operand is used as the <i>path</i> argument.

               --  The value of the bitwise-inclusive OR of S_IRUSR,
                   S_IWUSR, S_IRGRP, S_IWGRP, S_IROTH, and S_IWOTH is
                   used as the <i>mode</i> argument.

            b. The <i>futimens</i>() function is called with the following
               arguments:

               --  The file descriptor opened in step 1a.

               --  The access time and the modification time, set as
                   described in the OPTIONS section, are used as the
                   first and second elements of the <i>times</i> array
                   argument, respectively.

        2. If <i>file</i> exists, the <i>utimensat</i>() function is called with the
           following arguments:

            a. The AT_FDCWD special value is used as the <i>fd</i> argument.

            b. The <i>file</i> operand is used as the <i>path</i> argument.

            c. The access time and the modification time, set as
               described in the OPTIONS section, are used as the first
               and second elements of the <i>times</i> array argument,
               respectively.

            d. The <i>flag</i> argument is set to zero.
