       <b>pmnsmerge </b>merges multiple instances of a Performance Metrics Name
       Space (PMNS), as used by the components of the Performance Co-
       Pilot (PCP).

       Each <i>infile</i> argument names a file that includes the root of a
       PMNS, of the form

                 root {
                     /* arbitrary stuff */
                 }

       The order in which the <i>infile</i> files are processed is determined
       by the presence or absence of embedded control lines of the form

       #define _DATESTAMP <i>YYYYMMDD</i>

       Files without a control line are processed first and in the order
       they appear on the command line.  The other files are then
       processed in order of ascending _DATESTAMP.

       The <b>-a </b>option suppresses the argument re-ordering and processes
       all files in the order they appear on the command line.

       The merging proceeds by matching names in PMNS, only those <b>new</b>
       names in each PMNS are considered, and these are added after any
       existing metrics with the longest possible matching prefix in
       their names.  For example, merging these two input PMNS

                 root {                    root {
                                               surprise  1:1:3
                     mine       1:1:1          mine      1:1:1
                     foo                       foo
                                               yawn
                     yours      1:1:2
                 }                         }
                 foo {                     foo {
                     fumble     1:2:1
                                               mumble    1:2:3
                     stumble    1:2:2          stumble   1:2:2
                 }                         }
                                           yawn {
                                               sleepy    1:3:1
                                           }

       Produces the resulting PMNS in <i>out</i>.

                 root {
                     mine      1:1:1
                     foo
                     yours     1:1:2
                     surprise  1:1:3
                     yawn
                 }
                 foo {
                     fumble    1:2:1
                     stumble   1:2:2
                     mumble    1:2:3
                 }
                 yawn {
                     sleepy    1:3:1
                 }

       To avoid accidental over-writing of PMNS files, <i>outfile</i> is
       expected to not exist when <b>pmnsmerge </b>starts.  The <b>-f </b>option
       allows an existing <i>outfile</i> to be unlinked (if possible) and
       truncated before writing starts.

       Normally duplicate names for the same Performance Metric
       Identifier (PMID) in a PMNS are allowed.  The <b>-d </b>option is the
       default option and is included for backwards compatibility.  The
       <b>-x </b>option reverses the default and <b>pmnsmerge </b>will report an error
       and exit with a non-zero status if a duplicate name is found for
       a PMID in any of the <i>input</i> PMNS files or in the merged <i>output</i>
       PMNS.

       The <b>-v </b>option produces one line of diagnostic output as each
       <i>infile</i> is processed.

       Once all of the merging has been completed, <b>pmnsmerge </b>will
       attempt to load the resultant namespace using
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/pmLoadASCIINameSpace.3.html">pmLoadASCIINameSpace(3)</a> - if this fails for any reason, <i>outfile</i>
       will still be created, but <b>pmnsmerge </b>will report the problem and
       exit with non-zero status.

       Using <b>pmnsmerge </b>with a single <i>input</i> argument allows that PMNS
       file to be checked.  In addition to syntactic checking,
       specifying <b>-x </b>will also enable a check for duplicate names for
       all PMIDs.
