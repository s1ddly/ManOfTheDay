       <i>pdfroff</i> is a wrapper program for the GNU text processing system,
       <i>groff</i>.  It transparently handles the mechanics of multiple pass
       <i>groff</i> processing, when applied to suitably marked up <i>groff</i> source
       files, such that tables of contents and body text are formatted
       separately, and are subsequently combined in the correct order,
       for final publication as a single PDF document.  A further
       optional “style sheet” capability is provided; this allows for
       the definition of content which is required to precede the table
       of contents, in the published document.

       For each invocation of <i>pdfroff</i>, the ultimate <i>groff</i> output stream
       is post-processed by the Ghostscript <b>gs</b>(1) interpreter to produce
       a finished PDF document.

       <i>pdfroff</i> makes no assumptions about, and imposes no restrictions
       on, the use of any <i>groff</i> macro packages which the user may choose
       to employ, in order to achieve a desired document format;
       however, it <i>does</i> include specific built in support for the
       <i>pdfmark</i> macro package, should the user choose to employ it.
       Specifically, if the <i>pdfhref</i> macro, defined in the <i>pdfmark.tmac</i>
       package, is used to define public reference marks, or dynamic
       links to such reference marks, then <i>pdfroff</i> performs as many
       preformatting <i>groff</i> passes as required, up to a maximum limit of
       <i>four</i>, in order to compile a document reference dictionary, to
       resolve references, and to expand the dynamically defined content
       of links.
