       <b>badblocks </b>is used to search for bad blocks on a device (usually a
       disk partition).  <i>device</i> is the special file corresponding to the
       device (e.g <i>/dev/hdc1</i>).  <i>last_block</i> is the last block to be
       checked; if it is not specified, the last block on the device is
       used as a default.  <i>first_block</i> is an optional parameter
       specifying the starting block number for the test, which allows
       the testing to start in the middle of the disk.  If it is not
       specified the first block on the disk is used as a default.

       <b>Important note: </b>If the output of <b>badblocks </b>is going to be fed to
       the <b>e2fsck </b>or <b>mke2fs </b>programs, it is important that the block
       size is properly specified, since the block numbers which are
       generated are very dependent on the block size in use by the file
       system.  For this reason, it is strongly recommended that users
       <b>not </b>run <b>badblocks </b>directly, but rather use the <b>-c </b>option of the
       <b>e2fsck </b>and <b>mke2fs </b>programs.
