<pre>
       Run the <i>executable</i> within the specified context, using the
       alternate home directory and /tmp directory.  The seunshare
       command unshares from the default namespace, then mounts the
       specified homedir and tmpdir over the default homedir and /tmp.
       Finally it tells the kernel to execute the application under the
       specified SELinux context.

       <b>-h homedir</b>
              Alternate homedir to be used by the application.  Homedir
              must be owned by the user.

       <b>-t tmpdir</b>
              Use alternate temporary directory to mount on /tmp.
              tmpdir must be owned by the user.

       <b>-C --capabilities</b>
              Allow apps executed within the namespace to use
              capabilities.  Default is no capabilities.

       <b>-k --kill</b>
              Kill all processes with matching MCS level.

       <b>-Z context</b>
              Use alternate SELinux context while running the
              executable.

       <b>-v     </b>Verbose output
