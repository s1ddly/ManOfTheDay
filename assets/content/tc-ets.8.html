       The Enhanced Transmission Selection scheduler is a classful
       queuing discipline that merges functionality of PRIO and DRR
       qdiscs in one scheduler. ETS makes it easy to configure a set of
       strict and bandwidth-sharing bands to implement the transmission
       selection described in 802.1Qaz.

       On creation with 'tc qdisc add', a fixed number of bands is
       created. Each band is a class, although it is not possible to
       directly add and remove bands with 'tc class' commands. The
       number of bands to be created must instead be specified on the
       command line as the qdisc is added.

       The minor number of classid to use when referring to a band is
       the band number increased by one. Thus band 0 will have classid
       of major:1, band 1 that of major:2, etc.

       ETS bands are of two types: some number may be in strict mode,
       the remaining ones are in bandwidth-sharing mode.
