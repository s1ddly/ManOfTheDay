       <b>userdbctl </b>may be used to inspect user and groups (as well as
       group memberships) of the system. This client utility inquires
       user/group information provided by various system services, both
       operating on JSON user/group records (as defined by the <b>JSON User</b>
       <b>Records</b><b></b>[1] and <b>JSON Group Records</b><b></b>[2] definitions), and classic
       UNIX NSS/glibc user and group records. This tool is primarily a
       client to the <b>User/Group Record Lookup API via Varlink</b><b></b>[3], and
       may also pick up drop-in JSON user and group records from
       /etc/userdb/, /run/userdb/, /run/host/userdb/, /usr/lib/userdb/.
