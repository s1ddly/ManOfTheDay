       <b>xfs_scrub </b>attempts to check and repair all metadata in a mounted
       XFS filesystem.

       <b>WARNING!  </b>This program is <b>EXPERIMENTAL</b>, which means that its
       behavior and interface could change at any time!

       <b>xfs_scrub </b>asks the kernel to scrub all metadata objects in the
       filesystem.  Metadata records are scanned for obviously bad
       values and then cross-referenced against other metadata.  The
       goal is to establish a reasonable confidence about the
       consistency of the overall filesystem by examining the
       consistency of individual metadata records against the other
       metadata in the filesystem.  Damaged metadata can be rebuilt from
       other metadata if there exists redundant data structures which
       are intact.

       Filesystem corruption and optimization opportunities will be
       logged to the standard error stream.  Enabling verbose mode will
       increase the amount of status information sent to the output.

       If the kernel scrub reports that metadata needs repairs or
       optimizations and the user does not pass <b>-n </b>on the command line,
       this program will ask the kernel to make the repairs and to
       perform the optimizations.  See the sections about optimizations
       and repairs for a list of optimizations and repairs known to this
       program.  The kernel may not support repairing or optimizing the
       filesystem.  If this is the case, the filesystem must be
       unmounted and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/xfs_repair.8.html">xfs_repair(8)</a> run on the filesystem to fix the
       problems.
