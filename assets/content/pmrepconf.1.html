       <b>pmrepconf </b>may be used to create and modify a generic
       configuration file for <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmrep.1.html">pmrep(1)</a> and related utilities in the
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/pmrep.conf.5.html">pmrep.conf(5)</a> format.

       If <i>configfile</i> does not exist, <b>pmrepconf </b>will create a generic
       configuration file with a set of discovered metrics in a
       [metrics] section.

       Once created, <i>configfile</i> may be used with the <b>-c </b>option to
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmrep.1.html">pmrep(1)</a> and related utilities such as <b>pcp2elasticsearch</b>(2) and
       <b>pcp2spark</b>(2).

       If <i>configfile</i> does exist, <b>pmrepconf </b>will prompt for input from
       the user to enable or disable groups of related performance
       metrics.

       Group selection requires a simple <b>y </b>(yes) or <b>n </b>(no) response to
       the prompt <b>Log this group?</b>.

       Other responses at this point may be used to select additional
       control functions as follows:

       <b>m         </b>Report the names of the metrics in the current group.

       <b>q         </b>Finish with group selection (quit) and make no further
                 changes to this group or any subsequent group.

       <b>/</b><i>pattern</i>  Make no change to this group but search for a group
                 containing <i>pattern</i> in the description of the group or
                 the names of the associated metrics.

       When run from automated setup processes, the <b>-c </b>option is used to
       indicate that <i>pmrepconf</i> is in auto-create mode and no interactive
       dialog takes place.  The output <i>configfile</i> has an additional
       comment message and timestamp indicating this fact, so that it
       can be identified and subsequently updated using <b>-c </b>again.  This
       option is not appropriate for interactive use of the tool.

       More verbose output may be enabled with the <b>-v </b>option.
