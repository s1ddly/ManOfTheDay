       The <b>sa2 </b>command is a shell procedure variant of the <b>sar </b>command
       which writes a daily report in the <i>sarDD</i> or the <i>sarYYYYMMDD</i> file,
       where <i>YYYY</i> stands for the current year, <i>MM</i> for the current month
       and <i>DD</i> for the current day. By default the report is saved in the
       <i>/var/log/sa</i> directory. The <b>sa2 </b>command will also remove reports
       more than one week old by default.  You can however keep reports
       for a longer (or a shorter) period by setting the <b>HISTORY</b>
       environment variable. Read the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/sysstat.5.html">sysstat(5)</a> manual page for
       details.

       The <b>sa2 </b>command accepts most of the flags and parameters of the
       <b>sar </b>command.

       The <b>sa2 </b>command is designed to be started automatically by the
       <b>cron </b>command.
