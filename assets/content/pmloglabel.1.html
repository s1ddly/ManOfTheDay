       <b>pmloglabel </b>verifies, reports on, and can modify all details of
       the labels in each of the files of a Performance Co-Pilot (PCP)
       archive log.  The archive log has the base name <i>archive</i> and must
       have been previously created using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a>.

       Each of the files in a PCP archive (metadata, temporal index, and
       one or more data volumes) must contain a valid label at the
       start, else the PCP tools will refuse to open the archive at all.

       Thus, the primary function of <b>pmloglabel </b>is to be able to repair
       any inconsistent or corrupt label fields, such that the entire
       archive is not lost.  It will not check the remainder of the
       archive, but it will give you a fighting chance to recover
       otherwise lost data.  Together, <b>pmloglabel </b>and <b>pmlogextract </b>are
       able to produce a valid PCP archive from many forms of
       corruption.

       Note that if the temporal index is found to be corrupt, the
       "*.index" file can be safely moved aside and the archive will
       still be accessible, however retrievals may take longer without
       the index.
