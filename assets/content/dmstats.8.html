<pre>
       The dmstats program manages IO statistics regions for devices
       that use the device-mapper driver. Statistics regions may be
       created, deleted, listed and reported on using the tool.

       The first argument to dmstats is a <i>command</i>.

       The second argument is the <i>device name</i>, <i>uuid</i> or <i>major</i> and <i>minor</i>
       numbers.

       Further options permit the selection of regions, output format
       control, and reporting behaviour.

       When no device argument is given dmstats will by default operate
       on all device-mapper devices present. The <b>create </b>and <b>delete</b>
       commands require the use of <b>--alldevices </b>when used in this way.
