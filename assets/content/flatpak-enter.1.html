       Enter a running sandbox.

       INSTANCE must be either the pid of a process running in a flatpak
       sandbox, or the ID of a running application, or the instance ID
       of a running sandbox. You can use <b>flatpak ps </b>to find the instance
       IDs of running flatpaks.

       COMMAND is the command to run in the sandbox. Extra arguments are
       passed on to the command.

       This creates a new process within the running sandbox, with the
       same environment. This is useful when you want to debug a problem
       with a running application.

       This command works as a regular user if the system support
       unprivileged user namespace. If that is not available you need to
       run run it like: <b>sudo -E flatpak enter</b>.
