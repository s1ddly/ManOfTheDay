       <b>ipcrm </b>removes System V inter-process communication (IPC) objects
       and associated data structures from the system. In order to
       delete such objects, you must be superuser, or the creator or
       owner of the object.

       System V IPC objects are of three types: shared memory, message
       queues, and semaphores. Deletion of a message queue or semaphore
       object is immediate (regardless of whether any process still
       holds an IPC identifier for the object). A shared memory object
       is only removed after all currently attached processes have
       detached (<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/shmdt.2.html">shmdt(2)</a>) the object from their virtual address space.

       Two syntax styles are supported. The old Linux historical syntax
       specifies a three-letter keyword indicating which class of object
       is to be deleted, followed by one or more IPC identifiers for
       objects of this type.

       The SUS-compliant syntax allows the specification of zero or more
       objects of all three types in a single command line, with objects
       specified either by key or by identifier (see below). Both keys
       and identifiers may be specified in decimal, hexadecimal
       (specified with an initial '0x' or '0X'), or octal (specified
       with an initial '0').

       The details of the removes are described in <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/shmctl.2.html">shmctl(2)</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/msgctl.2.html">msgctl(2)</a>,
       and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/semctl.2.html">semctl(2)</a>. The identifiers and keys can be found by using
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ipcs.1.html">ipcs(1)</a>.
