   <b>rdma system set - set RDMA subsystem network namespace mode</b>
   <b>rdma system show - display RDMA subsystem network namespace mode</b>
       <i>NEWMODE</i> - specifies the RDMA subsystem mode. Either exclusive or
       shared.  When user wants to assign dedicated RDMA device to a
       particular network namespace, exclusive mode should be set before
       creating any network namespace. If there are active network
       namespaces and if one or more RDMA devices exist, changing mode
       from shared to exclusive returns error code EBUSY.

       When RDMA subsystem is in shared mode, RDMA device is accessible
       in all network namespace. When RDMA device isolation among
       multiple network namespaces is not needed, shared mode can be
       used.

       It is preferred to not change the subsystem mode when there is
       active RDMA traffic running, even though it is supported.
