       <b>pmdaapache </b>is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
       extracts performance metrics describing the state of an Apache
       web server.

       The <b>apache </b>PMDA exports metrics that measure the request rate,
       cumulative request sizes, uptime and various connection states
       for active clients.

       This information is obtained by performing a HTTP request to the
       server status URL, which must be enabled in the <i>httpd.conf</i>
       configuration file.

            ExtendedStatus on
            &lt;Location /server-status&gt;
            SetHandler server-status
            Order deny,allow
            Deny from all
            Allow from localhost
            &lt;/Location&gt;

       A brief description of the <b>pmdaapache </b>command line options
       follows:

       <b>-d   </b>It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics <i>domain</i>
            number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is,
            <i>domain</i> should be different for every PMDA on the one host,
            and the same <i>domain</i> number should be used for the same PMDA
            on all hosts.

       <b>-l   </b>Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
            <i>apache.log</i> is written in the current directory of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a>
            when <b>pmdaapache </b>is started, i.e.  <b>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd .  </b>If
            the log file cannot be created or is not writable, output is
            written to the standard error instead.

       <b>-S   </b>Query the Apache status information from the named <i>server</i>
            rather than the local host.

       <b>-P   </b>Query the Apache status information from the given <i>port</i>
            rather than the default (80).

       <b>-L   </b>Specify an alternative <i>location</i> for finding the server-
            status page.

       <b>-U   </b>User account under which to run the agent.  The default is
            the unprivileged "pcp" account in current versions of PCP,
            but in older versions the superuser account ("root") was
            used by default.
