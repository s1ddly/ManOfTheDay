<pre>
       The GNU implementation of the <i>mm</i> macro package is part of the
       <i>groff</i> document formatting system.  The <i>mm</i> package is suitable for
       the composition of letters, memoranda, reports, and books.

       <i>groff mm</i> is intended to be compatible with the <i>mm</i> implementation
       found in the AT&amp;T Documenter's Workbench (DWB), with the
       following limitations.

       •      No Bell Labs localisms are implemented.

       •      The macros <b>OK </b>and <b>PM </b>are not implemented.

       •      Cut marks are not supported.

   <b>Localization</b>
       <i>groff mm</i> is designed to be easily localized.  Strings that can
       appear in output are collected in the file <i>/usr/local/share/</i>
       <i>groff/1.23.0/tmac/</i>xx<i>.tmac</i>, where <i>xx</i> is an ISO 639 two-letter
       language identifier.  For Swedish, this is <i>sv.tmac</i>; “sv”, not
       “se”.

       This package can also be localized by site or territory; for
       example, <i>/usr/local/share/groff/1.23.0/tmac/mse.tmac</i> illustrates
       how to adapt the output to a national standard using its ISO 3166
       territory code.  Such a package can define an internal string
       that causes a macro file called territory<i>_locale</i> to be loaded at
       package initialization.  If this mechanism is not used, a macro
       file called <i>locale</i> is loaded instead.  No diagnostic is produced
       if these macro files do not exist.

   <b>Registers and strings</b>
       The behavior of many macros can be configured by registers and
       strings.  A register is assigned with the <b>nr </b>request.

              <b>.nr </b><i>ident</i> [<b>±</b>]<i>n</i> [<i>i</i>]

       <i>ident</i> is the name of the register, and <i>n</i> is the value to be
       assigned.  <i>n</i> can be prefixed with a plus or minus sign if
       incrementation or decrementation (respectively) of the register's
       existing value is desired.  If assignment of a (possibly)
       negative <i>n</i> is required, further prefix it with a zero or enclose
       it in parentheses.  If <i>i</i> is specified, the register is
       automatically modified by <i>i</i> prior to interpolation if a plus or
       minus sign is included in the escape sequence as follows.

              <b>\n</b>[<b>±</b>]<b>[</b><i>ident</i><b>]</b>

       <i>i</i> can be negative; it combines algebraically with the sign in the
       interpolation escape.

       Strings are defined with the <b>ds </b>request.

              <b>.ds </b><i>ident string</i>

       The string is assigned everything up to the end of the line,
       including trailing spaces.  It is a good practice to end <i>string</i>
       with a comment escape sequence (<b>\"</b>) so that extraneous spaces do
       not intrude during document maintenance.  To include leading
       spaces in <i>string</i>, prefix it with a double quote.  Strings are
       interpolated with the <b>\* </b>escape sequence.

              <b>\*[</b><i>ident</i><b>]</b>

       Register and string name spaces are distinct, but strings and
       macros share a name space.  Defining a string with the same name
       as an <i>mm</i> macro is not supported and may cause incorrect
       rendering, the emission of diagnostic messages, and an error exit
       status from <i>troff</i>.

   <b>Register format</b>
       A register is interpolated using Arabic numerals if no other
       format has been assigned to it.  Assign a format to a register
       with the <b>af </b>request.

              <b>.af </b><i>R c</i>

       <i>R</i> is the name of the register, and <i>c</i> is the format.  If <i>c</i> is a
       sequence of Arabic numerals, their quantity defines a zero-padded
       minimum width for the interpolated register value.

              <b>Form   Sequence</b>
              1      0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 10, ...
              001    000, 001, 002, 003, ..., 1000, ...
              i      0, i, ii, iii, iv, ...
              I      0, I, II, III, IV, ...
              a      0, a, b, c, ..., z, aa, ab, ...
              A      0, A, B, C, ..., Z, AA, AB, ...

   <b>Fonts</b>
       In <i>groff mm</i>, the fonts (or rather, font styles) <b>R </b>(normal),
       <b>I </b>(italic), and <b>B </b>(bold) are mounted at font positions <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>,
       and <b>3</b>, respectively.  Internally, font positions are used for
       backwards compatibility.  From a practical point of view, it
       doesn't make a big difference—a different font family can still
       be selected by invoking <i>groff</i>'s <b>fam </b>request or using its <b>-f</b>
       command-line option.  On the other hand, if you want to replace
       just, for example, font <b>I </b>with Zapf Chancery Medium italic
       (available on <i>groff</i>'s <b>pdf </b>and <b>ps </b>output devices), you have to use
       the <b>fp </b>request, replacing the font at position 2 with
       “<b>.fp 2 ZCMI</b>”).  Because the cover sheet, memorandum type, and
       <i>refer</i>(1) integration macros explicitly request fonts named <b>B</b>, <b>I</b>,
       and <b>R</b>, you will also need to remap these font names with the <b>ftr</b>
       request, for instance with “<b>.ftr I ZCMI</b>”.
