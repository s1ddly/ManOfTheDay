       <b>gendict </b>reads the word list from <i>dictionary-file</i> and creates a
       string trie dictionary file. Normally this data file has the
       <b>.dict </b>extension.

       Words begin at the beginning of a line and are terminated by the
       first whitespace.  Lines that begin with whitespace are ignored.
