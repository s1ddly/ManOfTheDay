       Set the permissions for an application in an entry in the
       permission store. The entry is identified by TABLE and ID, the
       application is identified by APP_ID. The PERMISSION strings must
       be in a format suitable for the table.

       The permission store is used by portals. Each portal generally
       has its own table in the permission store, and the format of the
       table entries is specific to each portal.
