       <b>pmdaib </b>is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which exports
       information and performance metrics about local Infiniband HCAs
       and local or remote Infiniband GUIDs.

       A brief description of the <b>pmdaib </b>command line options follows:

       <b>-c   </b>Location of the config file.  By default, the config file is
            named <b>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/infiniband/config.  </b>See <b>CONFIG FILE </b>for
            more information.

       <b>-D   </b>A debug values, as specified by <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmdbg.1.html">pmdbg(1)</a>

       <b>-d   </b>Specify an alternate performance metrics <i>domain</i> number.
            Almost never necessary.

       <b>-l   </b>Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
            <i>ib.log</i> is written to <b>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd</b>.  If the log file
            cannot be created or is not writable, output is written to
            the standard error instead.

       <b>-w   </b>Write out the default config file to
            <b>$PCP_PMDAS_DIRS/infiniband </b>and exit immediately.  The
            written config file will contain the local HCA ports.  It
            will not overwrite an existing file.  This argument should
            only be used to create the template config file and should
            never appear in <i>pmcd.conf.</i>  See <b>CONFIG FILE </b>for more
            information on the file format and on monitoring remote
            GUIDs.
