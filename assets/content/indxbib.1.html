       <i>indxbib</i> makes an inverted index for the bibliographic databases
       in each <i>file</i> for use with <i>refer</i>(1), <i>lookbib</i>(1), and <i>lkbib</i>(1).
       Each created index is named file<i>.i</i>; writing is done to a
       temporary file which is then renamed to this.  If no <i>file</i>
       operands are given on the command line because the <b>-f </b>option has
       been used, and no <b>-o </b>option is given, the index will be named
       <i>Ind.i</i>.

       Bibliographic databases are divided into records by blank lines.
       Within a record, each field starts with a <b>% </b>character at the
       beginning of a line.  Fields have a one letter name that follows
       the <b>% </b>character.

       The values set by the <b>-c</b>, <b>-n</b>, <b>-l</b>, and <b>-t </b>options are stored in
       the index: when the index is searched, keys will be discarded and
       truncated in a manner appropriate to these options; the original
       keys will be used for verifying that any record found using the
       index actually contains the keys.  This means that a user of an
       index need not know whether these options were used in the
       creation of the index, provided that not all the keys to be
       searched for would have been discarded during indexing and that
       the user supplies at least the part of each key that would have
       remained after being truncated during indexing.  The value set by
       the <b>-i </b>option is also stored in the index and will be used in
       verifying records found using the index.
