       When you invoke GCC, it normally does preprocessing, compilation,
       assembly and linking.  The "overall options" allow you to stop
       this process at an intermediate stage.  For example, the <b>-c</b>
       option says not to run the linker.  Then the output consists of
       object files output by the assembler.

       Other options are passed on to one or more stages of processing.
       Some options control the preprocessor and others the compiler
       itself.  Yet other options control the assembler and linker; most
       of these are not documented here, since you rarely need to use
       any of them.

       Most of the command-line options that you can use with GCC are
       useful for C programs; when an option is only useful with another
       language (usually C++), the explanation says so explicitly.  If
       the description for a particular option does not mention a source
       language, you can use that option with all supported languages.

       The usual way to run GCC is to run the executable called <b>gcc</b>, or
       <i>machine</i><b>-gcc </b>when cross-compiling, or <i>machine</i><b>-gcc-</b><i>version</i> to run a
       specific version of GCC.  When you compile C++ programs, you
       should invoke GCC as <b>g++ </b>instead.

       The <b>gcc </b>program accepts options and file names as operands.  Many
       options have multi-letter names; therefore multiple single-letter
       options may <i>not</i> be grouped: <b>-dv </b>is very different from <b>-d -v</b>.

       You can mix options and other arguments.  For the most part, the
       order you use doesn't matter.  Order does matter when you use
       several options of the same kind; for example, if you specify <b>-L</b>
       more than once, the directories are searched in the order
       specified.  Also, the placement of the <b>-l </b>option is significant.

       Many options have long names starting with <b>-f </b>or with <b>-W</b>---for
       example, <b>-fmove-loop-invariants</b>, <b>-Wformat </b>and so on.  Most of
       these have both positive and negative forms; the negative form of
       <b>-ffoo </b>is <b>-fno-foo</b>.  This manual documents only one of these two
       forms, whichever one is not the default.

       Some options take one or more arguments typically separated
       either by a space or by the equals sign (<b>=</b>) from the option name.
       Unless documented otherwise, an argument can be either numeric or
       a string.  Numeric arguments must typically be small unsigned
       decimal or hexadecimal integers.  Hexadecimal arguments must
       begin with the <b>0x </b>prefix.  Arguments to options that specify a
       size threshold of some sort may be arbitrarily large decimal or
       hexadecimal integers followed by a byte size suffix designating a
       multiple of bytes such as "kB" and "KiB" for kilobyte and
       kibibyte, respectively, "MB" and "MiB" for megabyte and mebibyte,
       "GB" and "GiB" for gigabyte and gigibyte, and so on.  Such
       arguments are designated by <i>byte-size</i> in the following text.
       Refer to the NIST, IEC, and other relevant national and
       international standards for the full listing and explanation of
       the binary and decimal byte size prefixes.
