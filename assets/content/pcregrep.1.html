       <b>pcregrep </b>searches files for character patterns, in the same way
       as other grep commands do, but it uses the PCRE regular
       expression library to support patterns that are compatible with
       the regular expressions of Perl 5. See <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/pcresyntax.3.html">pcresyntax(3)</a> for a quick-
       reference summary of pattern syntax, or <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/pcrepattern.3.html">pcrepattern(3)</a> for a full
       description of the syntax and semantics of the regular
       expressions that PCRE supports.

       Patterns, whether supplied on the command line or in a separate
       file, are given without delimiters. For example:

         pcregrep Thursday /etc/motd

       If you attempt to use delimiters (for example, by surrounding a
       pattern with slashes, as is common in Perl scripts), they are
       interpreted as part of the pattern. Quotes can of course be used
       to delimit patterns on the command line because they are
       interpreted by the shell, and indeed quotes are required if a
       pattern contains white space or shell metacharacters.

       The first argument that follows any option settings is treated as
       the single pattern to be matched when neither <b>-e </b>nor <b>-f </b>is
       present.  Conversely, when one or both of these options are used
       to specify patterns, all arguments are treated as path names. At
       least one of <b>-e</b>, <b>-f</b>, or an argument pattern must be provided.

       If no files are specified, <b>pcregrep </b>reads the standard input. The
       standard input can also be referenced by a name consisting of a
       single hyphen.  For example:

         pcregrep some-pattern /file1 - /file3

       By default, each line that matches a pattern is copied to the
       standard output, and if there is more than one file, the file
       name is output at the start of each line, followed by a colon.
       However, there are options that can change how <b>pcregrep </b>behaves.
       In particular, the <b>-M </b>option makes it possible to search for
       patterns that span line boundaries. What defines a line boundary
       is controlled by the <b>-N </b>(<b>--newline</b>) option.

       The amount of memory used for buffering files that are being
       scanned is controlled by a parameter that can be set by the
       <b>--buffer-size </b>option.  The default value for this parameter is
       specified when <b>pcregrep </b>is built, with the default default being
       20K. A block of memory three times this size is used (to allow
       for buffering "before" and "after" lines). An error occurs if a
       line overflows the buffer.

       Patterns can be no longer than 8K or BUFSIZ bytes, whichever is
       the greater.  BUFSIZ is defined in <b>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</b>. When there is more
       than one pattern (specified by the use of <b>-e </b>and/or <b>-f</b>), each
       pattern is applied to each line in the order in which they are
       defined, except that all the <b>-e </b>patterns are tried before the <b>-f</b>
       patterns.

       By default, as soon as one pattern matches a line, no further
       patterns are considered. However, if <b>--colour </b>(or <b>--color</b>) is
       used to colour the matching substrings, or if <b>--only-matching</b>,
       <b>--file-offsets</b>, or <b>--line-offsets </b>is used to output only the part
       of the line that matched (either shown literally, or as an
       offset), scanning resumes immediately following the match, so
       that further matches on the same line can be found. If there are
       multiple patterns, they are all tried on the remainder of the
       line, but patterns that follow the one that matched are not tried
       on the earlier part of the line.

       This behaviour means that the order in which multiple patterns
       are specified can affect the output when one of the above options
       is used. This is no longer the same behaviour as GNU grep, which
       now manages to display earlier matches for later patterns (as
       long as there is no overlap).

       Patterns that can match an empty string are accepted, but empty
       string matches are never recognized. An example is the pattern
       "(super)?(man)?", in which all components are optional. This
       pattern finds all occurrences of both "super" and "man"; the
       output differs from matching with "super|man" when only the
       matching substrings are being shown.

       If the <b>LC_ALL </b>or <b>LC_CTYPE </b>environment variable is set, <b>pcregrep</b>
       uses the value to set a locale when calling the PCRE library.
       The <b>--locale </b>option can be used to override this.
