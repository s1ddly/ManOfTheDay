       Lets you rewrite Git revision history by rewriting the branches
       mentioned in the &lt;rev-list options&gt;, applying custom filters on
       each revision. Those filters can modify each tree (e.g. removing
       a file or running a perl rewrite on all files) or information
       about each commit. Otherwise, all information (including original
       commit times or merge information) will be preserved.

       The command will only rewrite the <i>positive</i> refs mentioned in the
       command line (e.g. if you pass <i>a..b</i>, only <i>b</i> will be rewritten).
       If you specify no filters, the commits will be recommitted
       without any changes, which would normally have no effect.
       Nevertheless, this may be useful in the future for compensating
       for some Git bugs or such, therefore such a usage is permitted.

       <b>NOTE</b>: This command honors <b>.git/info/grafts </b>file and refs in the
       <b>refs/replace/ </b>namespace. If you have any grafts or replacement
       refs defined, running this command will make them permanent.

       <b>WARNING</b>! The rewritten history will have different object names
       for all the objects and will not converge with the original
       branch. You will not be able to easily push and distribute the
       rewritten branch on top of the original branch. Please do not use
       this command if you do not know the full implications, and avoid
       using it anyway, if a simple single commit would suffice to fix
       your problem. (See the "RECOVERING FROM UPSTREAM REBASE" section
       in <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/git-rebase.1.html">git-rebase(1)</a> for further information about rewriting
       published history.)

       Always verify that the rewritten version is correct: The original
       refs, if different from the rewritten ones, will be stored in the
       namespace <i>refs/original/</i>.

       Note that since this operation is very I/O expensive, it might be
       a good idea to redirect the temporary directory off-disk with the
       <b>-d </b>option, e.g. on tmpfs. Reportedly the speedup is very
       noticeable.

   <b>Filters</b>
       The filters are applied in the order as listed below. The
       &lt;command&gt; argument is always evaluated in the shell context using
       the <i>eval</i> command (with the notable exception of the commit
       filter, for technical reasons). Prior to that, the <b>$GIT_COMMIT</b>
       environment variable will be set to contain the id of the commit
       being rewritten. Also, GIT_AUTHOR_NAME, GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL,
       GIT_AUTHOR_DATE, GIT_COMMITTER_NAME, GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL, and
       GIT_COMMITTER_DATE are taken from the current commit and exported
       to the environment, in order to affect the author and committer
       identities of the replacement commit created by
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/git-commit-tree.1.html">git-commit-tree(1)</a> after the filters have run.

       If any evaluation of &lt;command&gt; returns a non-zero exit status,
       the whole operation will be aborted.

       A <i>map</i> function is available that takes an "original sha1 id"
       argument and outputs a "rewritten sha1 id" if the commit has been
       already rewritten, and "original sha1 id" otherwise; the <i>map</i>
       function can return several ids on separate lines if your commit
       filter emitted multiple commits.
