<pre>
       The flatpak config command shows or modifies the configuration of
       a flatpak installation. The following keys are supported:

       <i>languages</i>
           The languages that are included when installing Locale
           extensions. The value is a semicolon-separated list of
           two-letter language codes, or one of the special values * or
           all. If this key is unset, flatpak defaults to including the
           <i>extra-languages</i> key and the current locale.

       <i>extra-languages</i>
           This key is used when languages is not set, and it defines
           extra locale extensions on top of the system configured
           languages. The value is a semicolon-separated list of locale
           identifiers (language, optional locale, optional codeset,
           optional modifier) as documented by <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/setlocale.3.html">setlocale(3)</a> (for
           example, en;en_DK;zh_HK.big5hkscs;uz_UZ.utf8@cyrillic).
