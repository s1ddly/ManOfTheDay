       MPTCP is a transport protocol built on top of TCP that allows TCP
       connections to use multiple paths to maximize resource usage and
       increase redundancy. The ip-mptcp sub-commands allow configuring
       several aspects of the MPTCP path manager, which is in charge of
       subflows creation:

       The <b>endpoint </b>object specifies the IP addresses that will be used
       and/or announced for additional subflows:

       ip mptcp endpoint add      add new MPTCP endpoint
       ip mptcp endpoint delete   delete existing MPTCP endpoint
       ip mptcp endpoint show     get existing MPTCP endpoint
       ip mptcp endpoint flush    flush all existing MPTCP endpoints

       <i>PORT</i>   When a port number is specified, incoming MPTCP subflows
              for already established MPTCP sockets will be accepted on
              the specified port, regardless the original listener port
              accepting the first MPTCP subflow and/or this peer being
              actually on the client side.

              <i>ID</i> is a unique numeric identifier for the given endpoint

       <b>signal </b>the endpoint will be announced/signalled to each peer via
              an ADD_ADDR MPTCP sub-option

       <b>subflow</b>
              if additional subflow creation is allowed by MPTCP limits,
              the endpoint will be used as the source address to create
              an additional subflow after that the MPTCP connection is
              established.

       <b>backup </b>the endpoint will be announced as a backup address, if
              this is a <b>signal </b>endpoint, or the subflow will be created
              as a backup one if this is a <b>subflow </b>endpoint

       The <b>limits </b>object specifies the constraints for subflow
       creations:

       ip mptcp limits show   get current MPTCP subflow creation limits
       ip mptcp limits set    change the MPTCP subflow creation limits

       <i>SUBFLOW_NR</i>
              specifies the maximum number of additional subflows
              allowed for each MPTCP connection. Additional subflows can
              be created due to: incoming accepted ADD_ADDR option,
              local <b>subflow </b>endpoints, additional subflows started by
              the peer.

       <i>ADD_ADDR_ACCEPTED_NR</i>
              specifies the maximum number of ADD_ADDR suboptions
              accepted for each MPTCP connection. The MPTCP path manager
              will try to create a new subflow for each accepted
              ADD_ADDR option, respecting the <i>SUBFLOW_NR</i> limit.

       <b>monitor </b>displays creation and deletion of MPTCP connections as
       well as addition or removal of remote addresses and subflows.
