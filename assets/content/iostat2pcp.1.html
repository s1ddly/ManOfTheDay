       <b>iostat2pcp </b>reads a text file created with <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/iostat.1.html">iostat(1)</a> (<i>infile</i>) and
       translates this into a Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) archive with
       the basename <i>outfile</i>.  If <i>infile</i> is ``-'' then <i>iostat2pcp</i> reads
       from standard input, allowing easy preprocessing of the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/iostat.1.html">iostat(1)</a>
       output with <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/sed.1.html">sed(1)</a> or similar.

       The resultant PCP archive may be used with all the PCP client
       tools to graph subsets of the data using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmchart.1.html">pmchart(1)</a>, perform data
       reduction and reporting, filter with the PCP inference engine
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmie.1.html">pmie(1)</a>, etc.

       A series of physical files will be created with the prefix
       <i>outfile</i>.  These are <i>outfile</i><b>.0 </b>(the performance data),
       <i>outfile</i><b>.meta </b>(the metadata that describes the performance data)
       and <i>outfile</i><b>.index </b>(a temporal index to improve efficiency of
       replay operations for the archive).  If any of these files exists
       already, then <b>iostat2pcp </b>will <b>not </b>overwrite them and will exit
       with an error message.

       The first output sample from <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/iostat.1.html">iostat(1)</a> contains a statistical
       summary since boot time and is ignored by <i>iostat2pcp</i>, so the
       first real data set is the second one in the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/iostat.1.html">iostat(1)</a> output.

       The best results are obtained when <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/iostat.1.html">iostat(1)</a> was run with its own
       <b>-t </b>flag, so each output sample is prefixed with a timestamp.
       Even better is <b>-t </b>with $<b>S_TIME_FORMAT=ISO </b>set in environment when
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/iostat.1.html">iostat(1)</a> is run, in which case the timestamp includes the
       timezone.

       Note that if $<b>S_TIME_FORMAT=ISO </b>is <b>not </b>used with the <b>-t </b>option
       then <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/iostat.1.html">iostat(1)</a> may produce a timestamp controlled by <b>LC_TIME </b>from
       the locale that is in a format <i>iostat2pcp</i> cannot parse.  The
       formats for the timestamp that <i>iostat2pcp</i> accepts are illustrated
       by these examples:

       <b>2013-07-06T21:34:39+1000</b>
           (for the $<b>S_TIME_FORMAT=ISO</b>).

       <b>2013-07-06 21:34:39</b>
           (for some of the European formats, e.g. de_AT, de_BE, de_LU
           and en_DK.utf8).

       <b>06/07/13 21:34:39</b>
           (for all of the $<b>LC_TIME </b>settings for English locales outside
           North America, e.g. en_AU, en_GB, en_IE, en_NZ, en_SG and
           en_ZA, and all the Spanish locales, e.g. es_ES, es_MX and
           es_AR).

       In particular, note that some common North American $<b>LC_TIME</b>
       settings will <b>not </b>work with <i>iostat2pcp</i> (namely, en_US, POSIX and
       C) because they use the MM/DD format which may be incorrectly
       converted with the assumed DD/MM format.  This is another reason
       to recommend setting $<b>S_TIME_FORMAT=ISO</b>.

       If there are no timestamps in the input stream, <i>iostat2pcp</i> will
       try and deduce the sample interval if basic Disk data (<b>-d </b>option
       for <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/iostat.1.html">iostat(1)</a>) is found.  If this fails, then the <b>-t </b>option may
       be used to specify the sample <i>interval</i> in seconds.  This option
       is ignored if timestamps are found in the input stream.

       The <b>-S </b>option may be used to specify as start time for the first
       real sample in <i>infile</i>, where <i>start</i> must have the format HH:MM:SS.
       This option is ignored if timestamps are found in the input
       stream.

       The <b>-Z </b>option may be used to specify a timezone.  It must have
       the format +HHMM (for hours and minutes East of UTC) or -HHMM
       (for hours and minutes West of UTC).  Note in particular that
       <b>neither </b>the <b>zoneinfo </b>(aka Olson) format, e.g. Europe/Paris, nor
       the Posix <b>TZ </b>format, e.g.  EST+5 is allowed for the <b>-Z </b>option.
       This option is ignored if ISO timestamps are found in the input
       stream.  If the timezone is not specified and cannot be deduced,
       it defaults to ``UTC''.

       Some additional diagnostic output is generated with the <b>-v</b>
       option.

       <b>iostat2pcp </b>is a Perl script that uses the PCP::LogImport Perl
       wrapper around the PCP <i>libpcp_import</i> library, and as such could
       be used as an example to develop new tools to import other types
       of performance data and create PCP archives.
