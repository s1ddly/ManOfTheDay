       The trace-cmd(1) stack enables the Ftrace stack tracer within the
       kernel. The stack tracer enables the function tracer and at each
       function call within the kernel, the stack is checked. When a new
       maximum usage stack is discovered, it is recorded.

       When no option is used, the current stack is displayed.

       To enable the stack tracer, use the option <b>--start</b>, and to
       disable the stack tracer, use the option <b>--stop</b>. The output will
       be the maximum stack found since the start was enabled.

       Use <b>--reset </b>to reset the stack counter to zero.
