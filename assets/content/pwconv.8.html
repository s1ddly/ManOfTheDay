       The <b>pwconv </b>command creates <i>shadow</i> from <i>passwd</i> and an optionally
       existing <i>shadow</i>.

       The <b>pwunconv </b>command creates <i>passwd</i> from <i>passwd</i> and <i>shadow</i> and
       then removes <i>shadow</i>.

       The <b>grpconv </b>command creates <i>gshadow</i> from <i>group</i> and an optionally
       existing <i>gshadow</i>.

       The <b>grpunconv </b>command creates <i>group</i> from <i>group</i> and <i>gshadow</i> and
       then removes <i>gshadow</i>.

       These four programs all operate on the normal and shadow password
       and group files: /etc/passwd, /etc/group, /etc/shadow, and
       /etc/gshadow.

       Each program acquires the necessary locks before conversion.
       <b>pwconv </b>and <b>grpconv </b>are similar. First, entries in the shadowed
       file which don't exist in the main file are removed. Then,
       shadowed entries which don't have `x' as the password in the main
       file are updated. Any missing shadowed entries are added.
       Finally, passwords in the main file are replaced with `x'. These
       programs can be used for initial conversion as well to update the
       shadowed file if the main file is edited by hand.

       <b>pwconv </b>will use the values of <i>PASS_MIN_DAYS</i>, <i>PASS_MAX_DAYS</i>, and
       <i>PASS_WARN_AGE</i> from /etc/login.defs when adding new entries to
       /etc/shadow.

       Likewise <b>pwunconv </b>and <b>grpunconv </b>are similar. Passwords in the
       main file are updated from the shadowed file. Entries which exist
       in the main file but not in the shadowed file are left alone.
       Finally, the shadowed file is removed. Some password aging
       information is lost by <b>pwunconv</b>. It will convert what it can.
