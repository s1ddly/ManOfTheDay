       <b>genpmda </b>is a rapid application development tool for creating new
       Performance Metrics Domain Agents, see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/PMDA.3.html">PMDA(3)</a>.  It provides a
       very easy and efficient way to extend the Performance Co-pilot
       (PCP) with new performance metrics without needing to understand
       the low level details of how PMDAs are constructed.

       <b>genpmda </b>reads a config file containing an augmented Performance
       Metrics Name Space, see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/PMNS.5.html">PMNS(5)</a>, and automatically generates
       virtually all of the source code to implement a fully functional
       PMDA, including the Makefile, name space, support scripts for
       configuring the new PMDA, and the metrics help text.  Fairly
       simple PMDAs can be automatically generated from the config file
       without writing any additional code.  More complicated PMDAs,
       e.g. containing multiple instance domains, require only the
       refresh methods for the instance domains to be written manually.

       An example of the config file format accepted by <b>genpmda </b>is given
       below.
