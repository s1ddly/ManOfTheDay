       VDO is software that provides inline block-level deduplication,
       compression, and thin provisioning capabilities for primary
       storage.

       Deduplication is a technique for reducing the consumption of
       storage resources by eliminating multiple copies of duplicate
       blocks. Compression takes the individual unique blocks and
       shrinks them.  These reduced blocks are then efficiently packed
       together into physical blocks. Thin provisioning manages the
       mapping from logical blocks presented by VDO to where the data
       has actually been physically stored, and also eliminates any
       blocks of all zeroes.

       With deduplication, instead of writing the same data more than
       once, VDO detects and records each duplicate block as a reference
       to the original block. VDO maintains a mapping from Logical Block
       Addresses (LBA) (used by the storage layer above VDO) to physical
       block addresses (used by the storage layer under VDO). After
       deduplication, multiple logical block addresses may be mapped to
       the same physical block address; these are called shared blocks
       and are reference-counted by the software.

       With compression, VDO compresses multiple blocks (or shared
       blocks) with the fast LZ4 algorithm, and bins them together where
       possible so that multiple compressed blocks fit within a 4 KB
       block on the underlying storage. Mapping from LBA is to a
       physical block address and index within it for the desired
       compressed data. All compressed blocks are individually reference
       counted for correctness.

       Block sharing and block compression are invisible to applications
       using the storage, which read and write blocks as they would if
       VDO were not present. When a shared block is overwritten, a new
       physical block is allocated for storing the new block data to
       ensure that other logical block addresses that are mapped to the
       shared physical block are not modified.

       To use VDO with <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/lvm.8.html">lvm(8)</a>, you must install the standard VDO user-
       space tools <b>vdoformat</b>(8) and the currently non-standard kernel
       VDO module "<i>kvdo</i>".

       The "<i>kvdo</i>" module implements fine-grained storage virtualization,
       thin provisioning, block sharing, and compression.  The "<i>uds</i>"
       module provides memory-efficient duplicate identification. The
       user-space tools include <b>vdostats</b>(8) for extracting statistics
       from VDO volumes.
