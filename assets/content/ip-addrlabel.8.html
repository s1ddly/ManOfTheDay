<pre>
       IPv6 address labels are used for address selection; they are
       described in RFC 3484. Precedence is managed by userspace, and
       only the label itself is stored in the kernel.

   <b>ip addrlabel add - add an address label</b>
       add an address label entry to the kernel.

       <b>prefix </b><i>PREFIX</i>

       <b>dev </b><i>DEV</i>
              the outgoing interface.

       <b>label </b><i>NUMBER</i>
              the label for the prefix.  0xffffffff is reserved.

   <b>ip addrlabel del - delete an address label</b>
       delete an address label entry from the kernel.  <b>Arguments:</b>
       coincide with the arguments of <b>ip addrlabel add </b>but the label is
       not required.

   <b>ip addrlabel list - list address labels</b>
       list the current address label entries in the kernel.

   <b>ip addrlabel flush - flush address labels</b>
       flush all address labels in the kernel. This does not restore any
       default settings.
