       Installs an application or runtime. The primary way to install is
       to specify a REMOTE name as the source and one ore more REFs to
       specify the application or runtime to install. If REMOTE is
       omitted, the configured remotes are searched for the first REF
       and the user is asked to confirm the resulting choice.

       Each REF argument is a full or partial identifier in the flatpak
       ref format, which looks like "(app|runtime)/ID/ARCH/BRANCH". All
       elements except ID are optional and can be left out, including
       the slashes, so most of the time you need only specify ID. Any
       part left out will be matched against what is in the remote, and
       if there are multiple matches you will be prompted to choose one
       of them. You will also be prompted with choices if REF doesn't
       match anything in the remote exactly but is similar to one or
       more refs in the remote (e.g. "devhelp" is similar to
       "org.gnome.Devhelp").

       By default this looks for both apps and runtimes with the given
       REF in the specified REMOTE, but you can limit this by using the
       <b>--app </b>or <b>--runtime </b>option, or by supplying the initial element in
       the REF.

       If REMOTE is a uri or a path (absolute or relative starting with
       ./) to a local repository, then that repository will be used as
       the source, and a temporary remote will be created for the
       lifetime of the REF.

       If the specified REMOTE has a collection ID configured on it,
       flatpak will search mounted filesystems such as USB drives as
       well as Avahi services advertised on the local network for the
       needed refs, in order to support offline updates. See
       <b>ostree-find-remotes</b>(1) for more information.

       The alternative form of the command (with <b>--from </b>or <b>--bundle</b>)
       allows to install directly from a source such as a .flatpak
       single-file bundle or a .flatpakref application description. The
       options are optional if the first argument has the expected
       filename extension.

       Note that flatpak allows to have multiple branches of an
       application and runtimes installed and used at the same time.
       However, only one version of an application can be current,
       meaning its exported files (for instance desktop files and icons)
       are visible to the host. The last installed version is made
       current by default, but this can manually changed with flatpak
       make-current.

       Unless overridden with the <b>--user </b>or the <b>--installation </b>option,
       this command installs the application or runtime in the default
       system-wide installation.
