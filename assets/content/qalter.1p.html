<pre>
       The attributes of a batch job are altered by a request to the
       batch server that manages the batch job. The <i>qalter</i> utility is a
       user-accessible batch client that requests the alteration of the
       attributes of one or more batch jobs.

       The <i>qalter</i> utility shall alter the attributes of those batch
       jobs, and only those batch jobs, for which a batch <i>job_identifier</i>
       is presented to the utility.

       The <i>qalter</i> utility shall alter the attributes of batch jobs in
       the order in which the batch <i>job_identifier</i>s are presented to the
       utility.

       If the <i>qalter</i> utility fails to process a batch <i>job_identifier</i>
       successfully, the utility shall proceed to process the remaining
       batch <i>job_identifier</i>s, if any.

       For each batch <i>job_identifier</i> for which the <i>qalter</i> utility
       succeeds, each attribute of the identified batch job shall be
       altered as indicated by all the options presented to the utility.

       For each identified batch job for which the <i>qalter</i> utility fails,
       the utility shall not alter any attribute of the batch job.

       For each batch job that the <i>qalter</i> utility processes, the utility
       shall not modify any attribute other than those required by the
       options and option-arguments presented to the utility.

       The <i>qalter</i> utility shall alter batch jobs by sending a <i>Modify Job</i>
       <i>Request</i> to the batch server that manages each batch job. At the
       time the <i>qalter</i> utility exits, it shall have modified the batch
       job corresponding to each successfully processed batch
       <i>job_identifier</i>.  An attempt to alter the attributes of a batch
       job in the RUNNING state is implementation-defined.
