<pre>
       <b>dpkg-distaddfile </b>adds an entry for a named file to <b>debian/files</b>.

       It takes three non-option arguments, the filename and the section
       and priority for the <b>.changes </b>file.

       The filename should be specified relative to the directory where
       <b>dpkg-genchanges </b>will expect to find the files, usually <b>..</b>, rather
       than being a pathname relative to the current directory when
       <b>dpkg-distaddfile </b>is run.
