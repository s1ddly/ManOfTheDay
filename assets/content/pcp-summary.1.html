       The <b>pcp </b>command is used in one of two modes.  By default, it
       summarizes the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) installation on the
       local host.  This mode can also be used to summarize the
       installation from a remote <i>host</i>, or a historical installation
       from a set of PCP <i>archives</i>.  This mode indirectly invokes the
       <b>pcp-summary </b><i>command</i> (in the absence of any other requested
       command).

       Alternatively, a <i>command</i> can be passed to <b>pcp </b>to run, again
       possibly in the context of a remote <i>host</i> or set of historical
       <i>archives</i>.
