       This utility manages <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/flock.2.html">flock(2)</a> locks from within shell scripts or
       from the command line.

       The first and second of the above forms wrap the lock around the
       execution of a <i>command</i>, in a manner similar to <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/su.1.html">su(1)</a> or
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/newgrp.1.html">newgrp(1)</a>. They lock a specified <i>file</i> or <i>directory</i>, which is
       created (assuming appropriate permissions) if it does not already
       exist. By default, if the lock cannot be immediately acquired,
       <b>flock </b>waits until the lock is available.

       The third form uses an open file by its file descriptor <i>number</i>.
       See the examples below for how that can be used.
