       <b>pmdasmart </b>is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
       exports metric values for Device Mapper on the local system.

       This PMDA collects its data through the <b>smartctl</b>(8) utility and
       requires that the program is installed in order to function.

       Further details on smartctl and smartmontools can be found at
