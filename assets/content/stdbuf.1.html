       Run COMMAND, with modified buffering operations for its standard
       streams.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short
       options too.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--input</b>=<i>MODE</i>
              adjust standard input stream buffering

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--output</b>=<i>MODE</i>
              adjust standard output stream buffering

       <b>-e</b>, <b>--error</b>=<i>MODE</i>
              adjust standard error stream buffering

       <b>--help </b>display this help and exit

       <b>--version</b>
              output version information and exit

       If MODE is 'L' the corresponding stream will be line buffered.
       This option is invalid with standard input.

       If MODE is '0' the corresponding stream will be unbuffered.

       Otherwise MODE is a number which may be followed by one of the
       following: KB 1000, K 1024, MB 1000*1000, M 1024*1024, and so on
       for G, T, P, E, Z, Y.  Binary prefixes can be used, too: KiB=K,
       MiB=M, and so on.  In this case the corresponding stream will be
       fully buffered with the buffer size set to MODE bytes.

       NOTE: If COMMAND adjusts the buffering of its standard streams
       ('tee' does for example) then that will override corresponding
       changes by 'stdbuf'.  Also some filters (like 'dd' and 'cat'
       etc.) don't use streams for I/O, and are thus unaffected by
       'stdbuf' settings.
