       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/yum-versionlock.1.html">yum-versionlock(1)</a> is a Yum plugin that takes a set of
       name/versions for packages and excludes all other versions of
       those packages (including optionally following obsoletes).  This
       allows you to protect packages from being updated by newer
       versions.

       The plugin provides a command "versionlock" which allows you to
       view and edit the list of locked packages easily.

       <b>yum versionlock add &lt;package-wildcard&gt;...</b>
              Add a versionlock for all of the packages in the rpmdb
              matching the given wildcards.

       <b>yum versionlock exclude &lt;package-wildcard&gt;...</b>
              Opposite; disallow currently available versions of the
              packages matching the given wildcards.

       <b>yum versionlock list</b>
              List the current versionlock entries.

       <b>yum versionlock status</b>
              List any available updates that are currently blocked by
              versionlock.  That is, for each entry in the lock list,
              print the newest package available in the repos unless it
              is the particular locked/excluded version.

       <b>yum versionlock delete &lt;entry-wildcard&gt;...</b>
              Remove any matching versionlock entries.

       <b>yum versionlock clear</b>
              Remove all versionlock entries.
