       FQ-PIE (Flow Queuing with Proportional Integral controller
       Enhanced) is a queuing discipline that combines Flow Queuing with
       the PIE AQM scheme. FQ-PIE uses a Jenkins hash function to
       classify incoming packets into different flows and is used to
       provide a fair share of the bandwidth to all the flows using the
       qdisc. Each such flow is managed by the PIE algorithm.
