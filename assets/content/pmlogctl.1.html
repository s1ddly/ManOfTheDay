       <b>pmlogctl </b>may be used to manage <i>non-primary</i> instances of the
       Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) archiver <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a>.  This would be
       most relevant in a PCP archive logger ``farm'' where many
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> instances would be creating archives of performance
       data collected from <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> on many remote hosts.

       The <i>primary</i> <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> instance is closely linked to the local
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> process and as a consequence shares the same control
       infrastructure, namely <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/systemd.1.html">systemd(1)</a> or the PCP <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/init.1.html">init(1)</a> ``rc
       scripts''.  This is why the <i>primary</i> <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> instance <i>cannot</i>
       be managed with <b>pmlogctl</b>.

       For brevity in the description below, the term ``instance'' means
       a <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> instance.

       All instances managed by <b>pmlogctl</b>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmlogger_check.1.html">pmlogger_check(1)</a> and
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmlogger_daily.1.html">pmlogger_daily(1)</a> abide by the following rules:

       1. Each instance is fetching performance data from a single
          <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> (i.e. one host), but each <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> may be providing
          performance data to zero, one or more <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> processes
          running on one or more hosts.

       2. On the local host, each <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> instance must be specified
          once in a <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmlogger_check.1.html">pmlogger_check(1)</a> control file and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a>
          creates archives in a unique directory, named in the 4th
          parameter of the associated control file entry (see the
          CONFIGURATION section of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmlogger_check.1.html">pmlogger_check(1)</a>).

       3. Each instance belongs to exactly one <b>class</b>, optionally named
          using a <b>$class=...  </b>assignment in the associated control file.
          The special <b>default </b>class is reserved for all instances that
          do not have an associated <b>$class=...  </b>assignment.  For
          reporting purposes (refer to the <b>summary </b>command below), the
          <i>primary</i> <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> instance is automatically assigned to the
          special <b>primary </b>class.

       Each <b>pmlogctl </b>execution manages one or more instances updating
       the associated control files and then running <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmlogger_check.1.html">pmlogger_check(1)</a>
       to effect the desired change.

       The <i>host</i> arguments are usually valid host names.  For all
       commands <i>except</i> <b>create </b>and <b>cond-create </b>(described below) the <i>host</i>
       arguments may also be <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/egrep.1.html">egrep(1)</a> regular expressions that match the
       <i>whole</i> of a valid host name, so the pattern used is actually
       <b>^</b><i>host</i><b>$</b>.  For example <b>foo.*  </b>(matches all host names beginning
       with ``foo'') or <b>.*foo </b>(matches all host names ending with
       ``foo'') or <b>.*[fF][oO][oO].*  </b>(matches all host names containing
       ``foo'' in upper, lower or mixed case).

       The combination of a <i>class</i> from the optional <b>-c </b>option (or
       <b>default</b>) and the <i>host</i> arguments to each <i>command</i> identifies a
       <i>target of set</i> instances to which the <i>command</i> operation should be
       applied.

       The <b>-i </b>option may be used with the <b>create </b>or <b>cond-create </b>commands
       to override the instance identity that is specified in the ident
       section of the class policy file (see the CLASS POLICY FILE
       section below).  Since the identifier must be unique across all
       instances and all classes, it only makes sense to use this option
       when there is a single <i>host</i> argument.

       Given the tasks that <b>pmlogctl </b>is undertaking it usually must be
       run as ``root'', the exceptions being the <b>status </b>command or when
       the <b>-N </b>option is specified.
