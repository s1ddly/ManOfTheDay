       systemd is a system and service manager for Linux operating
       systems. When run as first process on boot (as PID 1), it acts as
       init system that brings up and maintains userspace services.
       Separate instances are started for logged-in users to start their
       services.

       <b>systemd </b>is usually not invoked directly by the user, but is
       installed as the /sbin/init symlink and started during early
       boot. The user manager instances are started automatically
       through the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/user@.service.5.html">user@.service(5)</a> service.

       For compatibility with SysV, if the binary is called as <b>init </b>and
       is not the first process on the machine (PID is not 1), it will
       execute <b>telinit </b>and pass all command line arguments unmodified.
       That means <b>init </b>and <b>telinit </b>are mostly equivalent when invoked
       from normal login sessions. See <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/telinit.8.html">telinit(8)</a> for more information.

       When run as a system instance, systemd interprets the
       configuration file system.conf and the files in system.conf.d
       directories; when run as a user instance, systemd interprets the
       configuration file user.conf and the files in user.conf.d
       directories. See <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/systemd-system.conf.5.html">systemd-system.conf(5)</a> for more information.
