       <b>last </b>looks through the file <i>wtmp</i> (which records all
       logins/logouts) and prints information about connect times of
       users. Records are printed from most recent to least recent.
       Records can be specified by tty and username.  tty names can be
       abbreviated:
                                    <b>last </b>0
       is equivalent to
                                  <b>last </b>tty0.

       Multiple arguments can be specified:
                               <b>last </b>root console
       will print all of the entries for the user <i>root</i> and all entries
       logged in on the <i>console</i> tty.

       The special users <i>reboot</i> and <i>shutdown</i> log in when the system
       reboots or (surprise) shuts down.
                                  <b>last </b>reboot
       will produce a record of reboot times.

       If <b>last </b>is interrupted by a quit signal, it prints out how far
       its search in the <i>wtmp</i> file had reached and then quits.
