       Operf is the profiler tool provided with OProfile. Operf uses the
       Linux Performance Events Subsystem and, thus, does not require
       the obsolete oprofile kernel driver.

       By default, operf uses &lt;current_dir&gt;/oprofile_data as the
       session-dir and stores profiling data there.  You can change this
       by way of the <i>--session-dir</i> option. The usual post-profiling
       analysis tools such as <b>opreport(1) </b>and <b>opannotate(1) </b>can be used
       to generate profile reports. Unless a <i>session-dir</i> is specified,
       the post-processing analysis tools will search for samples in
       &lt;current_dir&gt;/oprofile_data first. If that directory does not
       exist, the post-processing tools use the standard session-dir of
       /var/lib/oprofile.

       Statistics, such as total samples received and lost samples, are
       written to the operf.log file that can be found in the
       &lt;session_dir&gt;/samples directory.
