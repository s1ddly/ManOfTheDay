       <b>cmirrord </b>is the daemon that tracks mirror log information in a
       cluster.  It is specific to device-mapper based mirrors (and by
       extension, LVM cluster mirrors).  Cluster mirrors are not
       possible without this daemon running.

       This daemon relies on the cluster infrastructure provided by the
       corosync, which must be set up and running in order for cmirrord
       to function.

       Output is logged via <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/syslog.3.html">syslog(3)</a>. The <b>SIGUSR1 signal</b>(7) can be
       issued to <b>cmirrord </b>to gather current status information for
       debugging purposes.

       Once started, <b>cmirrord </b>will run until it is shutdown via <b>SIGINT</b>
       signal. If there are still active cluster mirrors, however, the
       signal will be ignored. Active cluster mirrors should be shutdown
       before stopping the cluster mirror log daemon.
