       <b>dh_usrlocal </b>is a debhelper program that can be used for building
       packages that will provide a subdirectory in <i>/usr/local</i> when
       installed.

       It finds subdirectories of <i>usr/local</i> in the package build
       directory, and removes them, replacing them with maintainer
       script snippets (unless <b>-n </b>is used) to create the directories at
       install time, and remove them when the package is removed, in a
       manner compliant with Debian policy. These snippets are inserted
       into the maintainer scripts by <b>dh_installdeb</b>. See
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dh_installdeb.1.html">dh_installdeb(1)</a> for an explanation of debhelper maintainer
       script snippets.

       When the <i>DEB_RULES_REQUIRES_ROOT</i> environment variable is not
       (effectively) <i>binary-targets</i>, the directories in <i>/usr/local</i> will
       be handled as if they were owned by root:root (see below).

       When the <i>DEB_RULES_REQUIRES_ROOT</i> environment variable has an
       effective value of <i>binary-targets</i>, the owners, groups and
       permissions will be preserved with the sole exception where the
       directory is owned by root:root.

       If a directory is owned by root:root, then ownership will be
       determined at install time.  The ownership and permission bits
       will either be root:root mode 0755 or root:staff mode 02775.  The
       actual choice depends on whether the system has
       <i>/etc/staff-group-for-usr-local</i> (as documented in the Debian
       Policy Manual ยง9.1.2 since version 4.1.4)
