       <b>pmprobe </b>determines the availability of performance metrics
       exported through the facilities of the Performance Co-Pilot
       (PCP).

       The metrics of interest are named in the <i>metricname</i> arguments.
       If <i>metricname</i> is a non-leaf node in the Performance Metrics Name
       Space (<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/PMNS.5.html">PMNS(5)</a>), then <b>pmprobe </b>will recursively descend the PMNS
       and report on all leaf nodes.  If no <i>metricname</i> argument is
       given, the root of the namespace is used.

       This recursive expansion of the PMNS can be inhibited by the <b>-F</b>
       (go faster) option, which reduces the number of roundtrips to
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> when the <i>metricname</i> arguments are known to be leaf nodes
       ahead of time.

       The output format is spartan and intended for use in wrapper
       scripts creating configuration files for other PCP tools.  By
       default, there is one line of output per metric, with the metric
       name followed by a count of the number of available values.
       Error conditions are encoded as a negative value count (as per
       the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/PMAPI.3.html">PMAPI(3)</a> protocols, but may be decoded using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmerr.1.html">pmerr(1)</a>) and
       followed by a textual description of the error.

       Unless directed to another host by the <b>-h </b>option, <b>pmprobe </b>will
       contact the Performance Metrics Collector Daemon (PMCD) on the
       local host.

       The <b>-a </b>option causes <b>pmprobe </b>to use the specified set of archives
       rather than connecting to a PMCD.

       The <b>-L </b>option causes <b>pmprobe </b>to use a local context to collect
       metrics from PMDAs on the local host without PMCD.  Only some
       metrics are available in this mode.

       The <b>-a</b>, <b>-h </b>and <b>-L </b>options are mutually exclusive.
