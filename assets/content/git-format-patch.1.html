       Prepare each non-merge commit with its "patch" in one "message"
       per commit, formatted to resemble a UNIX mailbox. The output of
       this command is convenient for e-mail submission or for use with
       <i>git am</i>.

       A "message" generated by the command consists of three parts:

       •   A brief metadata header that begins with <b>From &lt;commit&gt; </b>with a
           fixed <b>Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001 </b>datestamp to help programs
           like "file(1)" to recognize that the file is an output from
           this command, fields that record the author identity, the
           author date, and the title of the change (taken from the
           first paragraph of the commit log message).

       •   The second and subsequent paragraphs of the commit log
           message.

       •   The "patch", which is the "diff -p --stat" output (see
           <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/git-diff.1.html">git-diff(1)</a>) between the commit and its parent.

       The log message and the patch is separated by a line with a
       three-dash line.

       There are two ways to specify which commits to operate on.

        1. A single commit, &lt;since&gt;, specifies that the commits leading
           to the tip of the current branch that are not in the history
           that leads to the &lt;since&gt; to be output.

        2. Generic &lt;revision range&gt; expression (see "SPECIFYING
           REVISIONS" section in <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/gitrevisions.7.html">gitrevisions(7)</a>) means the commits in
           the specified range.

       The first rule takes precedence in the case of a single &lt;commit&gt;.
       To apply the second rule, i.e., format everything since the
       beginning of history up until &lt;commit&gt;, use the <b>--root </b>option:
       <b>git format-patch --root &lt;commit&gt;</b>. If you want to format only
       &lt;commit&gt; itself, you can do this with <b>git format-patch -1</b>
       <b>&lt;commit&gt;</b>.

       By default, each output file is numbered sequentially from 1, and
       uses the first line of the commit message (massaged for pathname
       safety) as the filename. With the <b>--numbered-files </b>option, the
       output file names will only be numbers, without the first line of
       the commit appended. The names of the output files are printed to
       standard output, unless the <b>--stdout </b>option is specified.

       If <b>-o </b>is specified, output files are created in &lt;dir&gt;. Otherwise
       they are created in the current working directory. The default
       path can be set with the <b>format.outputDirectory </b>configuration
       option. The <b>-o </b>option takes precedence over
       <b>format.outputDirectory</b>. To store patches in the current working
       directory even when <b>format.outputDirectory </b>points elsewhere, use
       <b>-o .</b>. All directory components will be created.

       By default, the subject of a single patch is "[PATCH] " followed
       by the concatenation of lines from the commit message up to the
       first blank line (see the DISCUSSION section of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/git-commit.1.html">git-commit(1)</a>).

       When multiple patches are output, the subject prefix will instead
       be "[PATCH n/m] ". To force 1/1 to be added for a single patch,
       use <b>-n</b>. To omit patch numbers from the subject, use <b>-N</b>.

       If given <b>--thread</b>, <b>git-format-patch </b>will generate <b>In-Reply-To </b>and
       <b>References </b>headers to make the second and subsequent patch mails
       appear as replies to the first mail; this also generates a
       <b>Message-Id </b>header to reference.
