       Given one argument, reads which branch head the given symbolic
       ref refers to and outputs its path, relative to the <b>.git/</b>
       directory. Typically you would give <b>HEAD </b>as the &lt;name&gt; argument
       to see which branch your working tree is on.

       Given two arguments, creates or updates a symbolic ref &lt;name&gt; to
       point at the given branch &lt;ref&gt;.

       Given <b>--delete </b>and an additional argument, deletes the given
       symbolic ref.

       A symbolic ref is a regular file that stores a string that begins
       with <b>ref: refs/</b>. For example, your <b>.git/HEAD </b>is a regular file
       whose contents is <b>ref: refs/heads/master</b>.
