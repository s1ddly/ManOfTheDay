<pre>
       This command does assorted sanity tests, initially through linked
       routines but also will look for a directory with more tests in
       the form of scripts.

       To get a list of available tests use <i>perf test list</i>, specifying a
       test name fragment will show all tests that have it.

       To run just specific tests, inform test name fragments or the
       numbers obtained from <i>perf test list</i>.
