       The CUPS notifier interface provides a standard method for adding
       support for new event notification methods to CUPS.  Each
       notifier delivers one or more IPP events from the standard input
       to the specified recipient.

       Notifiers <b>MUST </b>read IPP messages from the standard input using
       the <b>ippNew</b>() and <b>ippReadFile</b>() functions and exit on error.
       Notifiers are encouraged to exit after a suitable period of
       inactivity, however they may exit after reading the first message
       or stay running until an error is seen.  Notifiers inherit the
       environment and can use the logging mechanism documented in
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/filter.7.html">filter(7)</a>.
