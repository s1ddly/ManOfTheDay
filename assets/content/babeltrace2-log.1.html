       The <b>babeltrace2-log </b>tool reads the lines of a Linux kernel ring
       buffer, as printed by the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dmesg.1.html">dmesg(1)</a> tool, from the standard input
       stream and converts them to a CTF (see &lt;<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pagestp://diamon.org/ctf/">http://diamon.org/ctf/</a>&gt;)
       trace written to the <i>OUTPUT-PATH</i> directory.

       Usage example:

           $ dmesg | babeltrace2-log --with-timestamps my-trace

       The events of the generated CTF trace are named <b>string </b>and
       contain a single payload string field named <b>str </b>which contains
       the corresponding ring buffer line.

       By default, <b>babeltrace2-log </b>does not try to extract the
       timestamps of the kernel ring buffer lines to use them as the
       created eventsâ€™s timestamps. A typical <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dmesg.1.html">dmesg(1)</a> line looks like
       this:

           [87166.510937] PM: Finishing wakeup.

       In the last example, the <b>[87166.510937] </b>part is a timestamp which
       could be extracted. You can make <b>babeltrace2-log </b>extract
       timestamps from lines with the <b>--with-timestamps </b>option.
