       This tutorial explains how to import a new project into Git, make
       changes to it, and share changes with other developers.

       If you are instead primarily interested in using Git to fetch a
       project, for example, to test the latest version, you may prefer
       to start with the first two chapters of <b>The Git Userâ€™s Manual</b><b></b>[1].

       First, note that you can get documentation for a command such as
       <b>git log --graph </b>with:

           $ man git-log

       or:

           $ git help log

       With the latter, you can use the manual viewer of your choice;
       see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/git-help.1.html">git-help(1)</a> for more information.

       It is a good idea to introduce yourself to Git with your name and
       public email address before doing any operation. The easiest way
       to do so is:

           $ git config --global user.name "Your Name Comes Here"
           $ git config --global user.email you@yourdomain.example.com
