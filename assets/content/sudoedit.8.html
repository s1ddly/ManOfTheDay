     <b>sudo </b>allows a permitted user to execute a <i>command</i> as the superuser
     or another user, as specified by the security policy.  The invoking
     user's real (<i>not</i> effective) user-ID is used to determine the user
     name with which to query the security policy.

     <b>sudo </b>supports a plugin architecture for security policies and
     input/output logging.  Third parties can develop and distribute
     their own policy and I/O logging plugins to work seamlessly with
     the <b>sudo </b>front end.  The default security policy is <i>sudoers</i>, which
     is configured via the file <i>/etc/sudoers</i>, or via LDAP.  See the
     <i>Plugins</i> section for more information.

     The security policy determines what privileges, if any, a user has
     to run <b>sudo</b>.  The policy may require that users authenticate
     themselves with a password or another authentication mechanism.  If
     authentication is required, <b>sudo </b>will exit if the user's password
     is not entered within a configurable time limit.  This limit is
     policy-specific; the default password prompt timeout for the
     <i>sudoers</i> security policy is 5 minutes.

     Security policies may support credential caching to allow the user
     to run <b>sudo </b>again for a period of time without requiring
     authentication.  By default, the <i>sudoers</i> policy caches credentials
     on a per-terminal basis for 5 minutes.  See the <i>timestamp_type</i> and
     <i>timestamp_timeout</i> options in sudoers(5) for more information.  By
     running <b>sudo </b>with the <b>-v </b>option, a user can update the cached
     credentials without running a <i>command</i>.

     On systems where <b>sudo </b>is the primary method of gaining superuser
     privileges, it is imperative to avoid syntax errors in the security
     policy configuration files.  For the default security policy,
     sudoers(5), changes to the configuration files should be made using
     the visudo(8) utility which will ensure that no syntax errors are
     introduced.

     When invoked as <b>sudoedit</b>, the <b>-e </b>option (described below), is
     implied.

     Security policies may log successful and failed attempts to use
     <b>sudo</b>.  If an I/O plugin is configured, the running command's input
     and output may be logged as well.

     The options are as follows:

     <b>-A</b>, <b>--askpass</b>
                 Normally, if <b>sudo </b>requires a password, it will read it
                 from the user's terminal.  If the <b>-A </b>(<i>askpass</i>) option
                 is specified, a (possibly graphical) helper program is
                 executed to read the user's password and output the
                 password to the standard output.  If the SUDO_ASKPASS
                 environment variable is set, it specifies the path to
                 the helper program.  Otherwise, if sudo.conf(5)
                 contains a line specifying the askpass program, that
                 value will be used.  For example:

                     # Path to askpass helper program
                     Path askpass /usr/X11R6/bin/ssh-askpass

                 If no askpass program is available, <b>sudo </b>will exit with
                 an error.

     <b>-B</b>, <b>--bell  </b>Ring the bell as part of the password prompt when a
                 terminal is present.  This option has no effect if an
                 askpass program is used.

     <b>-b</b>, <b>--background</b>
                 Run the given command in the background.  Note that it
                 is not possible to use shell job control to manipulate
                 background processes started by <b>sudo</b>.  Most interactive
                 commands will fail to work properly in background mode.

     <b>-C </b><i>num</i>, <b>--close-from</b>=<i>num</i>
                 Close all file descriptors greater than or equal to <i>num</i>
                 before executing a command.  Values less than three are
                 not permitted.  By default, <b>sudo </b>will close all open
                 file descriptors other than standard input, standard
                 output and standard error when executing a command.
                 The security policy may restrict the user's ability to
                 use this option.  The <i>sudoers</i> policy only permits use
                 of the <b>-C </b>option when the administrator has enabled the
                 <i>closefrom_override</i> option.

     <b>-D </b><i>directory</i>, <b>--chdir</b>=<i>directory</i>
                 Run the command in the specified <i>directory</i> instead of
                 the current working directory.  The security policy may
                 return an error if the user does not have permission to
                 specify the working directory.

     <b>-E</b>, <b>--preserve-env</b>
                 Indicates to the security policy that the user wishes
                 to preserve their existing environment variables.  The
                 security policy may return an error if the user does
                 not have permission to preserve the environment.

     <b>--preserve-env=list</b>
                 Indicates to the security policy that the user wishes
                 to add the comma-separated list of environment
                 variables to those preserved from the user's
                 environment.  The security policy may return an error
                 if the user does not have permission to preserve the
                 environment.  This option may be specified multiple
                 times.

     <b>-e</b>, <b>--edit  </b>Edit one or more files instead of running a command.
                 In lieu of a path name, the string "sudoedit" is used
                 when consulting the security policy.  If the user is
                 authorized by the policy, the following steps are
                 taken:

                 1.   Temporary copies are made of the files to be
                      edited with the owner set to the invoking user.

                 2.   The editor specified by the policy is run to edit
                      the temporary files.  The <i>sudoers</i> policy uses the
                      SUDO_EDITOR, VISUAL and EDITOR environment
                      variables (in that order).  If none of
                      SUDO_EDITOR, VISUAL or EDITOR are set, the first
                      program listed in the <i>editor</i> sudoers(5) option is
                      used.

                 3.   If they have been modified, the temporary files
                      are copied back to their original location and the
                      temporary versions are removed.

                 To help prevent the editing of unauthorized files, the
                 following restrictions are enforced unless explicitly
                 allowed by the security policy:

                 <b>•  </b>Symbolic links may not be edited (version 1.8.15 and
                    higher).

                 <b>•  </b>Symbolic links along the path to be edited are not
                    followed when the parent directory is writable by
                    the invoking user unless that user is root (version
                    1.8.16 and higher).

                 <b>•  </b>Files located in a directory that is writable by the
                    invoking user may not be edited unless that user is
                    root (version 1.8.16 and higher).

                 Users are never allowed to edit device special files.

                 If the specified file does not exist, it will be
                 created.  Note that unlike most commands run by <i>sudo</i>,
                 the editor is run with the invoking user's environment
                 unmodified.  If the temporary file becomes empty after
                 editing, the user will be prompted before it is
                 installed.  If, for some reason, <b>sudo </b>is unable to
                 update a file with its edited version, the user will
                 receive a warning and the edited copy will remain in a
                 temporary file.

     <b>-g </b><i>group</i>, <b>--group</b>=<i>group</i>
                 Run the command with the primary group set to <i>group</i>
                 instead of the primary group specified by the target
                 user's password database entry.  The <i>group</i> may be
                 either a group name or a numeric group-ID (GID)
                 prefixed with the ‘#’ character (e.g., #0 for GID 0).
                 When running a command as a GID, many shells require
                 that the ‘#’ be escaped with a backslash (‘\’).  If no
                 <b>-u </b>option is specified, the command will be run as the
                 invoking user.  In either case, the primary group will
                 be set to <i>group</i>.  The <i>sudoers</i> policy permits any of the
                 target user's groups to be specified via the <b>-g </b>option
                 as long as the <b>-P </b>option is not in use.

     <b>-H</b>, <b>--set-home</b>
                 Request that the security policy set the HOME
                 environment variable to the home directory specified by
                 the target user's password database entry.  Depending
                 on the policy, this may be the default behavior.

     <b>-h</b>, <b>--help  </b>Display a short help message to the standard output and
                 exit.

     <b>-h </b><i>host</i>, <b>--host</b>=<i>host</i>
                 Run the command on the specified <i>host</i> if the security
                 policy plugin supports remote commands.  Note that the
                 <i>sudoers</i> plugin does not currently support running
                 remote commands.  This may also be used in conjunction
                 with the <b>-l </b>option to list a user's privileges for the
                 remote host.

     <b>-i</b>, <b>--login</b>
                 Run the shell specified by the target user's password
                 database entry as a login shell.  This means that
                 login-specific resource files such as <i>.profile</i>,
                 <i>.bash_profile</i> or <i>.login</i> will be read by the shell.  If
                 a command is specified, it is passed to the shell for
                 execution via the shell's <b>-c </b>option.  If no command is
                 specified, an interactive shell is executed.  <b>sudo</b>
                 attempts to change to that user's home directory before
                 running the shell.  The command is run with an
                 environment similar to the one a user would receive at
                 log in.  Note that most shells behave differently when
                 a command is specified as compared to an interactive
                 session; consult the shell's manual for details.  The
                 <i>Command environment</i> section in the sudoers(5) manual
                 documents how the <b>-i </b>option affects the environment in
                 which a command is run when the <i>sudoers</i> policy is in
                 use.

     <b>-K</b>, <b>--remove-timestamp</b>
                 Similar to the <b>-k </b>option, except that it removes the
                 user's cached credentials entirely and may not be used
                 in conjunction with a command or other option.  This
                 option does not require a password.  Not all security
                 policies support credential caching.

     <b>-k</b>, <b>--reset-timestamp</b>
                 When used without a command, invalidates the user's
                 cached credentials.  In other words, the next time <b>sudo</b>
                 is run a password will be required.  This option does
                 not require a password and was added to allow a user to
                 revoke <b>sudo </b>permissions from a <i>.logout</i> file.

                 When used in conjunction with a command or an option
                 that may require a password, this option will cause
                 <b>sudo </b>to ignore the user's cached credentials.  As a
                 result, <b>sudo </b>will prompt for a password (if one is
                 required by the security policy) and will not update
                 the user's cached credentials.

                 Not all security policies support credential caching.

     <b>-l</b>, <b>--list  </b>If no <i>command</i> is specified, list the allowed (and
                 forbidden) commands for the invoking user (or the user
                 specified by the <b>-U </b>option) on the current host.  A
                 longer list format is used if this option is specified
                 multiple times and the security policy supports a
                 verbose output format.

                 If a <i>command</i> is specified and is permitted by the
                 security policy, the fully-qualified path to the
                 command is displayed along with any command line
                 arguments.  If a <i>command</i> is specified but not allowed
                 by the policy, <b>sudo </b>will exit with a status value of 1.

     <b>-n</b>, <b>--non-interactive</b>
                 Avoid prompting the user for input of any kind.  If a
                 password is required for the command to run, <b>sudo </b>will
                 display an error message and exit.

     <b>-P</b>, <b>--preserve-groups</b>
                 Preserve the invoking user's group vector unaltered.
                 By default, the <i>sudoers</i> policy will initialize the
                 group vector to the list of groups the target user is a
                 member of.  The real and effective group-IDs, however,
                 are still set to match the target user.

     <b>-p </b><i>prompt</i>, <b>--prompt</b>=<i>prompt</i>
                 Use a custom password prompt with optional escape
                 sequences.  The following percent (‘%’) escape
                 sequences are supported by the <i>sudoers</i> policy:

                 %H  expanded to the host name including the domain name
                     (on if the machine's host name is fully qualified
                     or the <i>fqdn</i> option is set in sudoers(5))

                 %h  expanded to the local host name without the domain
                     name

                 %p  expanded to the name of the user whose password is
                     being requested (respects the <i>rootpw</i>, <i>targetpw</i>, and
                     <i>runaspw</i> flags in sudoers(5))

                 %U  expanded to the login name of the user the command
                     will be run as (defaults to root unless the <b>-u</b>
                     option is also specified)

                 %u  expanded to the invoking user's login name

                 %%  two consecutive ‘%’ characters are collapsed into a
                     single ‘%’ character

                 The custom prompt will override the default prompt
                 specified by either the security policy or the
                 SUDO_PROMPT environment variable.  On systems that use
                 PAM, the custom prompt will also override the prompt
                 specified by a PAM module unless the
                 <i>passprompt_override</i> flag is disabled in <i>sudoers</i>.

     <b>-R </b><i>directory</i>, <b>--chroot</b>=<i>directory</i>
                 Change to the specified root <i>directory</i> (see chroot(8))
                 before running the command.  The security policy may
                 return an error if the user does not have permission to
                 specify the root directory.

     <b>-S</b>, <b>--stdin</b>
                 Write the prompt to the standard error and read the
                 password from the standard input instead of using the
                 terminal device.

     <b>-s</b>, <b>--shell</b>
                 Run the shell specified by the SHELL environment
                 variable if it is set or the shell specified by the
                 invoking user's password database entry.  If a command
                 is specified, it is passed to the shell for execution
                 via the shell's <b>-c </b>option.  If no command is specified,
                 an interactive shell is executed.  Note that most
                 shells behave differently when a command is specified
                 as compared to an interactive session; consult the
                 shell's manual for details.

     <b>-U </b><i>user</i>, <b>--other-user</b>=<i>user</i>
                 Used in conjunction with the <b>-l </b>option to list the
                 privileges for <i>user</i> instead of for the invoking user.
                 The security policy may restrict listing other users'
                 privileges.  The <i>sudoers</i> policy only allows root or a
                 user with the ALL privilege on the current host to use
                 this option.

     <b>-T </b><i>timeout</i>, <b>--command-timeout</b>=<i>timeout</i>
                 Used to set a timeout for the command.  If the timeout
                 expires before the command has exited, the command will
                 be terminated.  The security policy may restrict the
                 ability to set command timeouts.  The <i>sudoers</i> policy
                 requires that user-specified timeouts be explicitly
                 enabled.

     <b>-u </b><i>user</i>, <b>--user</b>=<i>user</i>
                 Run the command as a user other than the default target
                 user (usually <i>root</i>).  The <i>user</i> may be either a user
                 name or a numeric user-ID (UID) prefixed with the ‘#’
                 character (e.g., #0 for UID 0).  When running commands
                 as a UID, many shells require that the ‘#’ be escaped
                 with a backslash (‘\’).  Some security policies may
                 restrict UIDs to those listed in the password database.
                 The <i>sudoers</i> policy allows UIDs that are not in the
                 password database as long as the <i>targetpw</i> option is not
                 set.  Other security policies may not support this.

     <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
                 Print the <b>sudo </b>version string as well as the version
                 string of the security policy plugin and any I/O
                 plugins.  If the invoking user is already root the <b>-V</b>
                 option will display the arguments passed to configure
                 when <b>sudo </b>was built and plugins may display more
                 verbose information such as default options.

     <b>-v</b>, <b>--validate</b>
                 Update the user's cached credentials, authenticating
                 the user if necessary.  For the <i>sudoers</i> plugin, this
                 extends the <b>sudo </b>timeout for another 5 minutes by
                 default, but does not run a command.  Not all security
                 policies support cached credentials.

     <b>--          </b>The <b>-- </b>option indicates that <b>sudo </b>should stop
                 processing command line arguments.

     Options that take a value may only be specified once unless
     otherwise indicated in the description.  This is to help guard
     against problems caused by poorly written scripts that invoke <b>sudo</b>
     with user-controlled input.

     Environment variables to be set for the command may also be passed
     on the command line in the form of <i>VAR</i>=<i>value</i>, e.g.,
     LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<i>/usr/local/pkg/lib</i>.  Variables passed on the
     command line are subject to restrictions imposed by the security
     policy plugin.  The <i>sudoers</i> policy subjects variables passed on the
     command line to the same restrictions as normal environment
     variables with one important exception.  If the <i>setenv</i> option is
     set in <i>sudoers</i>, the command to be run has the SETENV tag set or the
     command matched is ALL, the user may set variables that would
     otherwise be forbidden.  See sudoers(5) for more information.
