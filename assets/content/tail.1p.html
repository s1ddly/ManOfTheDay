<pre>
       The <i>tail</i> utility shall copy its input file to the standard output
       beginning at a designated place.

       Copying shall begin at the point in the file indicated by the <b>-c</b>
       <i>number</i> or <b>-n </b><i>number</i> options. The option-argument <i>number</i> shall be
       counted in units of lines or bytes, according to the options <b>-n</b>
       and <b>-c</b>.  Both line and byte counts start from 1.

       Tails relative to the end of the file may be saved in an internal
       buffer, and thus may be limited in length. Such a buffer, if any,
       shall be no smaller than {LINE_MAX}*10 bytes.
