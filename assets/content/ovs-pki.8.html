       The <b>ovs-pki </b>program sets up and manages a public key
       infrastructure for use with OpenFlow.  It is intended to be a
       simple interface for organizations that do not have an
       established public key infrastructure.  Other PKI tools can
       substitute for or supplement the use of <b>ovs-pki</b>.

       <b>ovs-pki </b>uses <b>openssl</b>(1) for certificate management and key
       generation.
