       The IB ACM implements and provides a framework for name, address,
       and route (path) resolution services over InfiniBand.  It is
       intended to address connection setup scalability issues running
       MPI applications on large clusters.  The IB ACM provides
       information needed to establish a connection, but does not
       implement the CM protocol.

       A primary user of the ibacm service is the librdmacm library.
       This enables applications to make use of the ibacm service
       without code changes or needing to be aware that the service is
       in use.  librdmacm versions 1.0.12 - 1.0.15 can invoke IB ACM
       services when built using the --with-ib_acm option.  Version
       1.0.16 and newer of librdmacm will automatically use the IB ACM
       if it is installed.  The IB ACM services tie in under the
       rdma_resolve_addr, rdma_resolve_route, and rdma_getaddrinfo
       routines.  For maximum benefit, the rdma_getaddrinfo routine
       should be used, however existing applications should still see
       significant connection scaling benefits using the calls available
       in librdmacm 1.0.11 and previous releases.

       The IB ACM is focused on being scalable, efficient, and
       extensible.  It implements a plugin architecture that allows a
       vendor to supply its proprietary provider in addition to the
       default provider.  The current default provider implementation
       ibacmp limits network traffic, SA interactions, and centralized
       services.  Ibacmp supports multiple resolution protocols in order
       to handle different fabric topologies.

       The IB ACM package is comprised of three components: the ibacm
       core service, the default provider ibacmp shared library, and a
       test/configuration utility - ib_acme.  All three are userspace
       components and are available for Linux.  Additional details are
       given below.
