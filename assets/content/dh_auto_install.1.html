       <b>dh_auto_install </b>is a debhelper program that tries to
       automatically install built files. It does so by running the
       appropriate command for the build system it detects the package
       uses. For example, if there's a <i>Makefile</i> and it contains a
       <b>install </b>target, then this is done by running <b>make </b>(or <b>MAKE</b>, if
       the environment variable is set). If there is a <i>setup.py</i> or
       <i>Build.PL</i>, it is used. Note that the Ant build system does not
       support installation, so <b>dh_auto_install </b>will not install files
       built using Ant.

       Unless <b>--destdir </b>option is specified, the files are installed
       into debian/<i>package</i>/ if there is only one binary package. In the
       multiple binary package case, the files are instead installed
       into <i>debian/tmp/</i>, and should be moved from there to the
       appropriate package build directory using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dh_install.1.html">dh_install(1)</a>.

       <b>DESTDIR </b>is used to tell make where to install the files.  If the
       Makefile was generated by MakeMaker from a <i>Makefile.PL</i>, it will
       automatically set <b>PREFIX=/usr </b>too, since such Makefiles need
       that.

       This is intended to work for about 90% of packages. If it doesn't
       work, or tries to use the wrong install target, you're encouraged
       to skip using <b>dh_auto_install </b>at all, and just run make install
       manually.
