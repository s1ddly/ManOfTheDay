<pre>
       Run COMMAND, ignoring hangup signals.

       <b>--help </b>display this help and exit

       <b>--version</b>
              output version information and exit

       If standard input is a terminal, redirect it from an unreadable
       file.  If standard output is a terminal, append output to
       'nohup.out' if possible, '$HOME/nohup.out' otherwise.  If
       standard error is a terminal, redirect it to standard output.  To
       save output to FILE, use 'nohup COMMAND &gt; FILE'.

       NOTE: your shell may have its own version of nohup, which usually
       supersedes the version described here.  Please refer to your
       shell's documentation for details about the options it supports.
