       <b>dh_systemd_enable </b>is a debhelper program that is responsible for
       enabling and disabling systemd unit files.

       In the simple case, it finds all unit files installed by a
       package (e.g.  bacula-fd.service) and enables them. It is not
       necessary that the machine actually runs systemd during package
       installation time, enabling happens on all machines in order to
       be able to switch from sysvinit to systemd and back.

       In the complex case, you can call <b>dh_systemd_enable </b>and
       <b>dh_systemd_start </b>manually (by overwriting the debian/rules
       targets) and specify flags per unit file. An example is colord,
       which ships colord.service, a dbus-activated service without an
       [Install] section. This service file cannot be enabled or
       disabled (a state called "static" by systemd) because it has no
       [Install] section. Therefore, running dh_systemd_enable does not
       make sense.

       For only generating blocks for specific service files, you need
       to pass them as arguments, e.g. <b>dh_systemd_enable quota.service</b>
       and <b>dh_systemd_enable --name=quotarpc quotarpc.service</b>.
