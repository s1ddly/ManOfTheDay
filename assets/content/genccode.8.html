<pre>
       <b>genccode </b>reads each of the supplied <i>filename</i> and writes out a C
       file containing a compilable definition of the data in the data
       file.  The C file name is made by taking the base name of the
       data <i>filename</i>, replacing dots by underscores, and adding a <i>.c</i>
       file extension.

       If the <b>-a </b>option is used, platform specific assembly code is
       generated instead of C code.  Most C compilers will accept both C
       and assembly files.  Instead of writing a filename with a <i>.c</i> file
       extension, a filename with a <i>.s</i> will be written instead.

       If <b>genccode </b>is called with no <i>filename</i> it terminates gracefully.
