       <b>cups-lpd </b>is the CUPS Line Printer Daemon ("LPD") mini-server that
       supports legacy client systems that use the LPD protocol.  <b>cups-</b>
       <b>lpd </b>does not act as a standalone network daemon but instead
       operates using any of the Internet "super-servers" such as
       <b>inetd</b>(8), <b>launchd</b>(8), and <b>systemd</b>(8).
