       <b>ovn-controller-vtep </b>is the local controller daemon in OVN, the
       Open Virtual Network, for VTEP enabled physical switches. It
       connects up to the OVN Southbound database (see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/ovn-sb.5.html">ovn-sb(5)</a>) over
       the OVSDB protocol, and down to the VTEP database (see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/vtep.5.html">vtep(5)</a>)
       over the OVSDB protocol.

   <b>PKI Options</b>
       PKI configuration is required in order to use SSL for the
       connections to the VTEP and Southbound databases.

              <b>-p </b><i>privkey.pem</i>
              <b>--private-key=</b><i>privkey.pem</i>
                   Specifies a PEM file containing the private key used
                   as identity for outgoing SSL connections.

              <b>-c </b><i>cert.pem</i>
              <b>--certificate=</b><i>cert.pem</i>
                   Specifies a PEM file containing a certificate that
                   certifies the private key specified on <b>-p </b>or
                   <b>--private-key </b>to be trustworthy. The certificate must
                   be signed by the certificate authority (CA) that the
                   peer in SSL connections will use to verify it.

              <b>-C </b><i>cacert.pem</i>
              <b>--ca-cert=</b><i>cacert.pem</i>
                   Specifies a PEM file containing the CA certificate
                   for verifying certificates presented to this program
                   by SSL peers. (This may be the same certificate that
                   SSL peers use to verify the certificate specified on
                   <b>-c </b>or <b>--certificate</b>, or it may be a different one,
                   depending on the PKI design in use.)

              <b>-C none</b>
              <b>--ca-cert=none</b>
                   Disables verification of certificates presented by
                   SSL peers. This introduces a security risk, because
                   it means that certificates cannot be verified to be
                   those of known trusted hosts.

              <b>--bootstrap-ca-cert=</b><i>cacert.pem</i>
                     When <i>cacert.pem</i> exists, this option has the same
                     effect as <b>-C </b>or <b>--ca-cert</b>. If it does not exist,
                     then the executable will attempt to obtain the CA
                     certificate from the SSL peer on its first SSL
                     connection and save it to the named PEM file. If it
                     is successful, it will immediately drop the
                     connection and reconnect, and from then on all SSL
                     connections must be authenticated by a certificate
                     signed by the CA certificate thus obtained.

                     This option exposes the SSL connection to a man-in-
                     the-middle attack obtaining the initial CA
                     certificate, but it may be useful for
                     bootstrapping.

                     This option is only useful if the SSL peer sends
                     its CA certificate as part of the SSL certificate
                     chain. The SSL protocol does not require the server
                     to send the CA certificate.

                     This option is mutually exclusive with <b>-C </b>and
                     <b>--ca-cert</b>.

              <b>--peer-ca-cert=</b><i>peer-cacert.pem</i>
                     Specifies a PEM file that contains one or more
                     additional certificates to send to SSL peers. <i>peer-</i>
                     <i>cacert.pem</i> should be the CA certificate used to
                     sign the program’s own certificate, that is, the
                     certificate specified on <b>-c </b>or <b>--certificate</b>. If
                     the program’s certificate is self-signed, then
                     <b>--certificate </b>and <b>--peer-ca-cert </b>should specify the
                     same file.

                     This option is not useful in normal operation,
                     because the SSL peer must already have the CA
                     certificate for the peer to have any confidence in
                     the program’s identity. However, this offers a way
                     for a new installation to bootstrap the CA
                     certificate on its first SSL connection.
