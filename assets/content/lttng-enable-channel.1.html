<pre>
       The <b>lttng enable-channel </b>command can create a new channel, or
       enable one or more existing and disabled ones.

       A channel is the owner of sub-buffers holding recorded events.
       Event, rules, when created using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/lttng-enable-event.1.html">lttng-enable-event(1)</a>, are
       always assigned to a channel. When creating a new channel, many
       parameters related to those sub-buffers can be fine-tuned. They
       are described in the subsections below.

       When <i>CHANNEL</i> does not name an existing channel, a channel named
       <i>CHANNEL</i> is created. Otherwise, the disabled channel named <i>CHANNEL</i>
       is enabled.

       Note that the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/lttng-enable-event.1.html">lttng-enable-event(1)</a> command can automatically
       create default channels when no channel exist.

       A channel is always contained in a tracing session (see
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/lttng-create.1.html">lttng-create(1)</a> for creating a tracing session). The session in
       which a channel is created using <b>lttng enable-channel </b>can be
       specified using the <b>--session </b>option. If the <b>--session </b>option is
       omitted, the current tracing session is targeted.

       Existing enabled channels can be disabled using
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/lttng-disable-channel.1.html">lttng-disable-channel(1)</a>. Channels of a given session can be
       listed using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/lttng-list.1.html">lttng-list(1)</a>.

       See the <i>LIMITATIONS</i> section below for a list of limitations of
       this command to consider.

   <b>Event loss modes</b>
       LTTng tracers are non-blocking by default: when no empty
       sub-buffer exists, losing events is acceptable when the
       alternative would be to cause substantial delays in the
       instrumented application’s execution.

       LTTng privileges performance over integrity, aiming at perturbing
       the traced system as little as possible in order to make tracing
       of subtle race conditions and rare interrupt cascades possible.

       You can allow the user space tracer to block with a <b>--blocking-</b>
       <b>timeout </b>option set to a positive value or to <b>inf</b>, and with an
       application which is instrumented with LTTng-UST started with a
       set <b>LTTNG_UST_ALLOW_BLOCKING </b>environment variable. See
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/lttng-ust.3.html">lttng-ust(3)</a> for more details.

       When it comes to losing events because no empty sub-buffer is
       available, the channel’s event loss mode, specified by one of the
       <b>--discard </b>and <b>--overwrite </b>options, determines what to do amongst:

       Discard
           Drop the newest events until a sub-buffer is released.

       Overwrite
           Clear the sub-buffer containing the oldest recorded events
           and start recording the newest events there. This mode is
           sometimes called <i>flight recorder mode</i> because it behaves like
           a flight recorder: always keep a fixed amount of the latest
           data.

       Which mechanism to choose depends on the context: prioritize the
       newest or the oldest events in the ring buffer?

       Beware that, in overwrite mode (<b>--overwrite </b>option), a whole
       sub-buffer is abandoned as soon as a new event doesn’t find an
       empty sub-buffer, whereas in discard mode (<b>--discard </b>option),
       only the event that doesn’t fit is discarded.

       Also note that a count of lost events is incremented and saved in
       the trace itself when an event is lost in discard mode, whereas
       no information is kept when a sub-buffer gets overwritten before
       being committed.

       The probability of losing events, if it is experience in a given
       context, can be reduced by fine-tuning the sub-buffers count and
       size (see next subsection).

   <b>Sub-buffers count and size</b>
       The <b>--num-subbuf </b>and <b>--subbuf-size </b>options respectively set the
       number of sub-buffers and their individual size when creating a
       new channel.

       Note that there is a noticeable tracer’s CPU overhead introduced
       when switching sub-buffers (marking a full one as consumable and
       switching to an empty one for the following events to be
       recorded). Knowing this, the following list presents a few
       practical situations along with how to configure sub-buffers for
       them when creating a channel in overwrite mode (<b>--overwrite</b>
       option):

       High event throughput
           In general, prefer bigger sub-buffers to lower the risk of
           losing events. Having bigger sub-buffers also ensures a lower
           sub-buffer switching frequency. The number of sub-buffers is
           only meaningful if the channel is enabled in overwrite mode:
           in this case, if a sub-buffer overwrite happens, the other
           sub-buffers are left unaltered.

       Low event throughput
           In general, prefer smaller sub-buffers since the risk of
           losing events is already low. Since events happen less
           frequently, the sub-buffer switching frequency should remain
           low and thus the tracer’s overhead should not be a problem.

       Low memory system
           If the target system has a low memory limit, prefer fewer
           first, then smaller sub-buffers. Even if the system is
           limited in memory, it is recommended to keep the sub-buffers
           as big as possible to avoid a high sub-buffer switching
           frequency.

       In discard mode (<b>--discard </b>option), the sub-buffers count
       parameter is pointless: using two sub-buffers and setting their
       size according to the requirements of the context is fine.

   <b>Switch timer</b>
       When a channel’s switch timer fires, a sub-buffer switch happens.
       This timer may be used to ensure that event data is consumed and
       committed to trace files periodically in case of a low event
       throughput.

       It’s also convenient when big sub-buffers are used to cope with
       sporadic high event throughput, even if the throughput is
       normally lower.

       Use the <b>--switch-timer </b>option to control the switch timer’s
       period of the channel to create.

   <b>Read timer</b>
       By default, an internal notification mechanism is used to signal
       a full sub-buffer so that it can be consumed. When such
       notifications must be avoided, for example in real-time
       applications, the channel’s read timer can be used instead. When
       the read timer fires, sub-buffers are checked for consumption
       when they are full.

       Use the <b>--read-timer </b>option to control the read timer’s period of
       the channel to create.

   <b>Monitor timer</b>
       When a channel’s monitor timer fires, its registered trigger
       conditions are evaluated using the current values of its
       properties (for example, the current usage of its sub-buffers).
       When a trigger condition is true, LTTng executes its associated
       action. The only type of action currently supported is to notify
       one or more user applications.

       See the installed C/C++ headers in <b>lttng/action</b>, <b>lttng/condition</b>,
       <b>lttng/notification</b>, and <b>lttng/trigger </b>to learn more about
       application notifications and triggers.

       Use the <b>--monitor-timer </b>option to control the monitor timer’s
       period of the channel to create.

   <b>Buffering scheme</b>
       In the user space tracing domain, two buffering schemes are
       available when creating a channel:

       Per-process buffering (<b>--buffers-pid </b>option)
           Keep one ring buffer per process.

       Per-user buffering (<b>--buffers-uid </b>option)
           Keep one ring buffer for all the processes of a single user.

       The per-process buffering scheme consumes more memory than the
       per-user option if more than one process is instrumented for
       LTTng-UST. However, per-process buffering ensures that one
       process having a high event throughput won’t fill all the shared
       sub-buffers, only its own.

       The Linux kernel tracing domain only has one available buffering
       scheme which is to use a single ring buffer for the whole system
       (<b>--buffers-global </b>option).

   <b>Trace files limit and size</b>
       By default, trace files can grow as large as needed. The maximum
       size of each trace file written by a channel can be set on
       creation using the <b>--tracefile-size </b>option. When such a trace
       file’s size reaches the channel’s fixed maximum size, another
       trace file is created to hold the next recorded events. A file
       count is appended to each trace file name in this case.

       If the <b>--tracefile-size </b>option is used, the maximum number of
       created trace files is unlimited. To limit them, the <b>--tracefile-</b>
       <b>count </b>option can be used. This option is always used in
       conjunction with the <b>--tracefile-size </b>option.

       For example, consider this command:

           $ lttng enable-channel --kernel --tracefile-size=4096 \
                                --tracefile-count=32 my-channel

       Here, for each stream, the maximum size of each trace file is 4
       kiB and there can be a maximum of 32 different files. When there
       is no space left in the last file, <i>trace file rotation</i> happens:
       the first file is cleared and new sub-buffers containing events
       are written there.

       LTTng does not guarantee that you can view the trace of an active
       tracing session (before you run the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/lttng-stop.1.html">lttng-stop(1)</a> command), even
       with multiple trace files, because LTTng could overwrite them at
       any moment, or some of them could be incomplete. You can archive
       a tracing session’s current trace chunk while the tracing session
       is active to obtain an unmanaged and self-contained LTTng trace:
       see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/lttng-rotate.1.html">lttng-rotate(1)</a> and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/lttng-enable-rotation.1.html">lttng-enable-rotation(1)</a>.
