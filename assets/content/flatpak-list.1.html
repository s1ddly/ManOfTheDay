       By default, both apps and runtimes are shown, but you can change
       this by using the <b>--app </b>or <b>--runtime </b>options.

       By default, both per-user and system-wide installations are
       shown. Use the <b>--user</b>, <b>--installation </b>or <b>--system </b>options to
       change this.

       The list command can also be used to find installed apps that use
       a certain runtime, with the <b>--app-runtime </b>option.
