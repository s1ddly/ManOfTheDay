       When GDB finds a symbol file, it scans the symbols in the file in
       order to construct an internal symbol table.  This lets most GDB
       operations work quickly--at the cost of a delay early on.  For
       large programs, this delay can be quite lengthy, so GDB provides
       a way to build an index, which speeds up startup.

       To determine whether a file contains such an index, use the
       command "readelf -S filename": the index is stored in a section
       named ".gdb_index".  The index file can only be produced on
       systems which use ELF binaries and DWARF debug information (i.e.,
       sections named ".debug_*").

       <b>gdb-add-index </b>uses GDB and <b>objdump </b>found in the <b>PATH </b>environment
       variable.  If you want to use different versions of these
       programs, you can specify them through the <b>GDB </b>and <b>OBJDUMP</b>
       environment variables.

       See more in the GDB manual in node "Index Files" -- shell command
       "info -f gdb -n "Index Files"".
