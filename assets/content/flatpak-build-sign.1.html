       Signs the commit for a specified application or runtime in a
       local repository.  LOCATION is the location of the repository.
       ID is the name of the application, or runtime if --runtime is
       specified. If BRANCH is not specified, it is assumed to be
       "master".

       Applications can also be signed during build-export, but it is
       sometimes useful to add additional signatures later.
