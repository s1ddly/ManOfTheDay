       <i>traceroute</i> tracks the route packets taken from an IP network on
       their way to a given host. It utilizes the IP protocol's time to
       live (TTL) field and attempts to elicit an ICMP TIME_EXCEEDED
       response from each gateway along the path to the host.

       <i>traceroute6</i> is equivalent to <i>traceroute</i> <b>-6</b>

       The only required parameter is the name or IP address of the
       destination <b>host </b>.  The optional <b>packet_len</b>`gth is the total size
       of the probing packet (default 60 bytes for IPv4 and 80 for
       IPv6). The specified size can be ignored in some situations or
       increased up to a minimal value.

       This program attempts to trace the route an IP packet would
       follow to some internet host by launching probe packets with a
       small ttl (time to live) then listening for an ICMP "time
       exceeded" reply from a gateway.  We start our probes with a ttl
       of one and increase by one until we get an ICMP "port
       unreachable" (or TCP reset), which means we got to the "host", or
       hit a max (which defaults to 30 hops). Three probes (by default)
       are sent at each ttl setting and a line is printed showing the
       ttl, address of the gateway and round trip time of each probe.
       The address can be followed by additional information when
       requested. If the probe answers come from different gateways, the
       address of each responding system will be printed.  If there is
       no response within a certain timeout, an "*" (asterisk) is
       printed for that probe.

       After the trip time, some additional annotation can be printed:
       <b>!H</b>, <b>!N</b>, or <b>!P </b>(host, network or protocol unreachable), <b>!S </b>(source
       route failed), <b>!F </b>(fragmentation needed), <b>!X </b>(communication
       administratively prohibited), <b>!V </b>(host precedence violation), <b>!C</b>
       (precedence cutoff in effect), or <b>!&lt;num&gt; </b>(ICMP unreachable code
       &lt;num&gt;).  If almost all the probes result in some kind of
       unreachable, traceroute will give up and exit.

       We don't want the destination host to process the UDP probe
       packets, so the destination port is set to an unlikely value (you
       can change it with the <b>-p </b>flag). There is no such a problem for
       ICMP or TCP tracerouting (for TCP we use half-open technique,
       which prevents our probes to be seen by applications on the
       destination host).

       In the modern network environment the traditional traceroute
       methods can not be always applicable, because of widespread use
       of firewalls.  Such firewalls filter the "unlikely" UDP ports, or
       even ICMP echoes.  To solve this, some additional tracerouting
       methods are implemented (including tcp), see <b>LIST OF AVAILABLE</b>
       <b>METHODS </b>below. Such methods try to use particular protocol and
       source/destination port, in order to bypass firewalls (to be seen
       by firewalls just as a start of allowed type of a network
       session).
