       Shows commit logs and diff output each commit introduces.

       New users are encouraged to use <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/git-log.1.html">git-log(1)</a> instead. The
       <b>whatchanged </b>command is essentially the same as <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/git-log.1.html">git-log(1)</a> but
       defaults to show the raw format diff output and to skip merges.

       The command is kept primarily for historical reasons; fingers of
       many people who learned Git long before <b>git log </b>was invented by
       reading Linux kernel mailing list are trained to type it.
