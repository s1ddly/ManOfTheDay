           <b>Note</b>
           You probably donâ€™t want to invoke this command yourself; it
           is started automatically when you use
           <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/git-credential-cache.1.html">git-credential-cache(1)</a>.

       This command listens on the Unix domain socket specified by
       <b>&lt;socket&gt; </b>for <b>git-credential-cache </b>clients. Clients may store and
       retrieve credentials. Each credential is held for a timeout
       specified by the client; once no credentials are held, the daemon
       exits.

       If the <b>--debug </b>option is specified, the daemon does not close its
       stderr stream, and may output extra diagnostics to it even after
       it has begun listening for clients.
