       This plugin extends <b>yum </b>for some commands that give aggregate
       package data based on lists of packages

       added yum <i>command</i>s are:
        * list-vendors
        * info-vendors
        * list-rpm-groups
        * info-rpm-groups
        * list-packagers
        * info-packagers
        * list-licenses
        * info-licenses
        * list-arches
        * info-arches
        * list-committers
        * info-committers
        * list-buildhosts
        * info-buildhosts
        * list-baseurls
        * info-baseurls
        * list-package-sizes
        * info-package-sizes
        * list-archive-sizes

        * list-installed-sizes
        * info-installed-sizes
        * list-groups
        * info-groups

       that the info versions lists all the packages under each
       aggregation.
