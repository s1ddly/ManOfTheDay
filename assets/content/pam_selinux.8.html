       pam_selinux is a PAM module that sets up the default SELinux
       security context for the next executed process.

       When a new session is started, the open_session part of the
       module computes and sets up the execution security context used
       for the next <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/execve.2.html">execve(2)</a> call, the file security context for the
       controlling terminal, and the security context used for creating
       a new kernel keyring.

       When the session is ended, the close_session part of the module
       restores old security contexts that were in effect before the
       change made by the open_session part of the module.

       Adding pam_selinux into the PAM stack might disrupt behavior of
       other PAM modules which execute applications. To avoid that,
       <i>pam_selinux.so open</i> should be placed after such modules in the
       PAM stack, and <i>pam_selinux.so close</i> should be placed before them.
       When such a placement is not feasible, <i>pam_selinux.so restore</i>
       could be used to temporary restore original security contexts.
