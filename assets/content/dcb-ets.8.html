       <b>dcb ets </b>is used to configure Enhanced Transmission Selection
       attributes through Linux DCB (Data Center Bridging) interface.
       ETS permits configuration of mapping of priorities to traffic
       classes, traffic selection algorithm to use per traffic class,
       bandwidth allocation, etc.

       Two DCB TLVs are related to the ETS feature: a configuration and
       recommendation values. Recommendation values are named with a
       prefix <b>reco-, </b>while the configuration ones have plain names.
