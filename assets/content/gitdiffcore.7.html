       The diff commands <i>git diff-index</i>, <i>git diff-files</i>, and <i>git</i>
       <i>diff-tree</i> can be told to manipulate differences they find in
       unconventional ways before showing <i>diff</i> output. The manipulation
       is collectively called "diffcore transformation". This short note
       describes what they are and how to use them to produce <i>diff</i>
       output that is easier to understand than the conventional kind.
