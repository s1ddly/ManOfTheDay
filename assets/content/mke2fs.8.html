       <b>mke2fs </b>is used to create an ext2, ext3, or ext4 file system,
       usually in a disk partition (or file) named by <i>device</i>.

       The file system size is specified by <i>fs-size</i>.  If <i>fs-size</i> does
       not have a suffix, it is interpreted as power-of-two kilobytes,
       unless the <b>-b </b><i>blocksize</i> option is specified, in which case <i>fs-</i>
       <i>size</i> is interpreted as the number of <i>blocksize</i> blocks.   If the
       fs-size is suffixed by 'k', 'm', 'g', 't' (either upper-case or
       lower-case), then it is interpreted in power-of-two kilobytes,
       megabytes, gigabytes, terabytes, etc.  If <i>fs-size</i> is omitted,
       <b>mke2fs </b>will create the file system based on the device size.

       If <b>mke2fs </b>is run as <b>mkfs.XXX </b>(i.e., <b>mkfs.ext2</b>, <b>mkfs.ext3</b>, or
       <b>mkfs.ext4</b>) the option <b>-t </b><i>XXX</i> is implied; so <b>mkfs.ext3 </b>will create
       a file system for use with ext3, <b>mkfs.ext4 </b>will create a file
       system for use with ext4, and so on.

       The defaults of the parameters for the newly created file system,
       if not overridden by the options listed below, are controlled by
       the <b>/etc/mke2fs.conf </b>configuration file.  See the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/mke2fs.conf.5.html">mke2fs.conf(5)</a>
       manual page for more details.
