       <b>mkswap </b>sets up a Linux swap area on a device or in a file.

       The <i>device</i> argument will usually be a disk partition (something
       like <i>/dev/sdb7</i>) but can also be a file. The Linux kernel does not
       look at partition IDs, but many installation scripts will assume
       that partitions of hex type 82 (LINUX_SWAP) are meant to be swap
       partitions. (<b>Warning: Solaris also uses this type. Be careful not</b>
       <b>to kill your Solaris partitions.</b>)

       The <i>size</i> parameter is superfluous but retained for backwards
       compatibility. (It specifies the desired size of the swap area in
       1024-byte blocks. <b>mkswap </b>will use the entire partition or file if
       it is omitted. Specifying it is unwise - a typo may destroy your
       disk.)

       After creating the swap area, you need the <b>swapon </b>command to
       start using it. Usually swap areas are listed in <i>/etc/fstab</i> so
       that they can be taken into use at boot time by a <b>swapon -a</b>
       command in some boot script.
