       pam_issue is a PAM module to prepend an issue file to the
       username prompt. It also by default parses escape codes in the
       issue file similar to some common getty's (using \x format).

       Recognized escapes:

       <b>\d</b>
           current day

       <b>\l</b>
           name of this tty

       <b>\m</b>
           machine architecture (uname -m)

       <b>\n</b>
           machine's network node hostname (uname -n)

       <b>\o</b>
           domain name of this system

       <b>\r</b>
           release number of operating system (uname -r)

       <b>\t</b>
           current time

       <b>\s</b>
           operating system name (uname -s)

       <b>\u</b>
           number of users currently logged in

       <b>\U</b>
           same as \u except it is suffixed with "user" or "users" (eg.
           "1 user" or "10 users")

           operating system version and build date (uname -v)
