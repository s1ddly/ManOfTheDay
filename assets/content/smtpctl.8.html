     The <b>smtpctl </b>program controls smtpd(8).  Commands may be abbreviated
     to the minimum unambiguous prefix; for example, <b>sh ro </b>for <b>show</b>
     <b>routes</b>.

     The <b>mailq </b>command is provided for compatibility with other MTAs and
     is simply a shortcut for <b>show queue</b>.

     The following commands are available:

     <b>discover </b><i>envelope-id</i> | <i>message-id</i>
             Schedule a single envelope, or all envelopes with the same
             message ID that were manually moved to the queue.

     <b>encrypt </b>[<i>string</i>]
             Encrypt the password <i>string</i> to a representation suitable
             for user credentials and print it to the standard output.
             If <i>string</i> is not provided, cleartext passwords are read
             from standard input.

             It is advised to avoid providing the password as a
             parameter as it will be visible from top(1) and ps(1)
             output.

     <b>log brief</b>
             Disable verbose debug logging.

     <b>log verbose</b>
             Enable verbose debug logging.

     <b>monitor</b>
             Display updates of some smtpd(8) internal counters in one
             second intervals.  Each line reports the increment of all
             counters since the last update, except for some counters
             which are always absolute values.  The first line reports
             the current value of each counter.  The fields are:

             <b>•   </b>Current number of active SMTP clients (absolute value).
             <b>•   </b>New SMTP clients.
             <b>•   </b>Disconnected clients.
             <b>•   </b>Current number of envelopes in the queue (absolute
                 value).
             <b>•   </b>Newly enqueued envelopes.
             <b>•   </b>Dequeued envelopes.
             <b>•   </b>Successful deliveries.
             <b>•   </b>Temporary failures.
             <b>•   </b>Permanent failures.
             <b>•   </b>Message loops.
             <b>•   </b>Expired envelopes.
             <b>•   </b>Envelopes removed by the administrator.
             <b>•   </b>Generated bounces.

     <b>pause envelope </b><i>envelope-id</i> | <i>message-id</i> | <b>all</b>
             Temporarily suspend scheduling for the envelope with the
             given ID, envelopes with the given message ID, or all
             envelopes.

     <b>pause mda</b>
             Temporarily stop deliveries to local users.

     <b>pause mta</b>
             Temporarily stop relaying and deliveries to remote users.

     <b>pause smtp</b>
             Temporarily stop accepting incoming sessions.

     <b>profile </b><i>subsystem</i>

     <b>show hosts</b>
             Display the list of known remote MX hosts.  For each of
             them, it shows the IP address, the canonical hostname, a

             host, and the elapsed time since the last connection.

     <b>show hoststats</b>
             Display status of last delivery for domains that have been
             active in the last 4 hours.  It consists of the following
             fields, separated by a "|":

             <b>•   </b>Domain.

             <b>•   </b>Number of delivery or relaying attempts.
             <b>•   </b>Current runstate: either "pending" or "inflight" if
                 smtpd(8) is running, or "offline" otherwise.
             <b>•   </b>Delay in seconds before the next attempt if pending, or
                 time elapsed if currently running.  This field is blank
                 if smtpd(8) is not running.
             <b>•   </b>Error string for the last failed delivery or relay
                 attempt.

     <b>show relays</b>
             Display the list of currently active relays and associated
             connectors.  For each relay, it shows a number of counters
             and information on its internal state on a single line.
             Then comes the list of connectors (source addresses to
             connect from for this relay).

     <b>show routes</b>
             Display status of routes currently known by smtpd(8).  Each
             line consists of a route number, a source address, a
             destination address, a set of flags, the number of
             connections on this route, the current penalty level which
             determines the amount of time the route is disabled if an
             error occurs, and the delay before it gets reactivated.
             The following flags are defined:

             D   The route is currently disabled.
             N   The route is new.  No SMTP session has been established
                 yet.
             Q   The route has a timeout registered to lower its penalty
                 level and possibly reactivate or discard it.

     <b>show stats</b>
             Displays runtime statistics concerning smtpd(8).

     <b>show status</b>
             Shows if MTA, MDA and SMTP systems are currently running or
             paused.

     <b>spf walk</b>
             Recursively look up SPF records for the domains read from
             stdin.  For example:

                   $ smtpctl spf walk &lt; domains.txt

             SPF records may contain macros which cannot be included in
             a static list and must be resolved dynamically at
             connection time.  <b>spf walk </b>cannot provide full results in
             these cases.

     <b>trace </b><i>subsystem</i>
             Enables real-time tracing of <i>subsystem</i>.  Supported
             subsystems are:

             <b>•   </b>imsg
             <b>•   </b>io
             <b>•   </b>smtp (incoming sessions)
             <b>•   </b>filters
             <b>•   </b>mta (outgoing sessions)
             <b>•   </b>bounce
             <b>•   </b>scheduler
             <b>•   </b>expand (aliases/virtual/forward expansion)
             <b>•   </b>lookup (user/credentials lookups)
             <b>•   </b>stat
             <b>•   </b>rules (matched by incoming sessions)
             <b>•   </b>mproc
             <b>•   </b>all

     <b>unprofile </b><i>subsystem</i>
             Disables real-time profiling of <i>subsystem</i>.

     <b>untrace </b><i>subsystem</i>
             Disables real-time tracing of <i>subsystem</i>.

     <b>update table </b><i>name</i>
             Updates the contents of table <i>name</i>, for tables using the
             “file” backend.

     When <b>smtpd </b>receives a message, it generates a <i>message-id</i> for the
     message, and one <i>envelope-id</i> per recipient.  The <i>message-id</i> is a
     32-bit random identifier that is guaranteed to be unique on the
     host system.  The <i>envelope-id</i> is a 64-bit unique identifier that
     encodes the <i>message-id</i> in the 32 upper bits and a random envelope
     identifier in the 32 lower bits.

     A command which specifies a <i>message-id</i> applies to all recipients of
     a message; a command which specifies an <i>envelope-id</i> applies to a
     specific recipient of a message.
