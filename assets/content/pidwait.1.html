       <b>pgrep </b>looks through the currently running processes and lists the
       process IDs which match the selection criteria to stdout.  All
       the criteria have to match.  For example,

              $ pgrep -u root sshd

       will only list the processes called <b>sshd </b>AND owned by <b>root</b>.  On
       the other hand,

              $ pgrep -u root,daemon

       will list the processes owned by <b>root </b>OR <b>daemon</b>.

       <b>pkill </b>will send the specified signal (by default <b>SIGTERM</b>) to each
       process instead of listing them on stdout.

       <b>pidwait </b>will wait for each process instead of listing them on
       stdout.
