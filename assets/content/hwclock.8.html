       <b>hwclock </b>is an administration tool for the time clocks. It can:
       display the Hardware Clock time; set the Hardware Clock to a
       specified time; set the Hardware Clock from the System Clock; set
       the System Clock from the Hardware Clock; compensate for Hardware
       Clock drift; correct the System Clock timescale; set the kernelâ€™s
       timezone, NTP timescale, and epoch (Alpha only); and predict
       future Hardware Clock values based on its drift rate.

       Since v2.26 important changes were made to the <b>--hctosys </b>function
       and the <b>--directisa </b>option, and a new option <b>--update-drift </b>was
       added. See their respective descriptions below.
