       <b>Crash </b>is a tool for interactively analyzing the state of the
       Linux system while it is running, or after a kernel crash has
       occurred and a core dump has been created by the <i>netdump,</i>
       <i>diskdump, LKCD, kdump, xendump kvmdump</i> or <i>VMware</i> facilities.  It
       is loosely based on the SVR4 UNIX crash command, but has been
       significantly enhanced by completely merging it with the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/gdb.1.html">gdb(1)</a>
       debugger. The marriage of the two effectively combines the
       kernel-specific nature of the traditional UNIX crash utility with
       the source code level debugging capabilities of <b>gdb(1).</b>

       In the <i>dumpfile form,</i> both a NAMELIST and a MEMORY-IMAGE argument
       must be entered.  In the <i>live system form,</i> the NAMELIST argument
       must be entered if the kernel's <i>vmlinux</i> file is not located in a
       known location, such as the <i>/usr/lib/debug/lib/modules/&lt;kernel-</i>
       <i>version&gt;</i> directory.

       The <b>crash </b>utility has also been extended to support the analysis
       of dumpfiles generated by a crash of the Xen hypervisor.  In that
       case, the NAMELIST argument must be that of the <i>xen-syms</i> binary.
       Live system analysis is not supported for the Xen hypervisor.

       The <b>crash </b>utility command set consists of common kernel core
       analysis tools such as kernel stack back traces of all processes,
       source code disassembly, formatted kernel structure and variable
       displays, virtual memory data, dumps of linked-lists, etc., along
       with several commands that delve deeper into specific kernel
       subsystems.  Appropriate <b>gdb </b>commands may also be entered, which
       in turn are passed on to the <b>gdb </b>module for execution.  If
       desired, commands may be placed in either a <i>$HOME/.crashrc</i> file
       and/or in a <i>.crashrc</i> file in the current directory.  During
       initialization, the commands in <i>$HOME/.crashrc</i> are executed
       first, followed by those in the <i>./.crashrc</i> file.

       The <b>crash </b>utility is designed to be independent of Linux version
       dependencies. When new kernel source code impacts the correct
       functionality of <b>crash </b>and its command set, the utility will be
       updated to recognize new kernel code changes, while maintaining
       backwards compatibility with earlier releases.
