       <b>lxc-stop </b>reboots, cleanly shuts down, or kills all the processes
       inside the container. By default, it will request a clean
       shutdown of the container by sending <b>lxc.signal.halt </b>(defaults to
       SIGPWR) to the container's init process, waiting up to 60 seconds
       for the container to exit, and then returning. If the container
       fails to cleanly exit in 60 seconds, it will be sent the
       <b>lxc.signal.stop </b>(defaults to SIGKILL) to force it to shut down. A
       request to reboot will send the <b>lxc.signal.reboot </b>(defaults to
       SIGINT) to the container's init process.

       The [-W], [-r], [-k] and [--nokill] options specify the action to
       perform.  [-W] indicates that after performing the specified
       action, <b>lxc-stop </b>should immediately exit, while [-t TIMEOUT]
       specifies the maximum amount of time to wait for the container to
       complete the shutdown or reboot.
