       <b>pmdate </b>displays the current date and/or time, with an optional
       offset.

       An <i>offset</i> is specified with a leading sign (``+'' or ``-''),
       followed by an integer value, followed by one of the following
       ``scale'' specifiers;

       S      seconds
       M      minutes
       H      hours
       d      days
       m      months
       y      years

       The output <i>format</i> follows the same rules as for <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/date.1.html">date(1)</a> and
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/strftime.3.html">strftime(3)</a>.

       For example, the following will display the date a week ago as
       DDMMYYYY;
               pmdate -7d %d%m%Y
