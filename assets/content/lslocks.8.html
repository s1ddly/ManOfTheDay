       <b>lslocks </b>lists information about all the currently held file locks
       in a Linux system.

       Note that lslocks also lists OFD (Open File Description) locks,
       these locks are not associated with any process (PID is -1). OFD
       locks are associated with the open file description on which they
       are acquired. This lock type is available since Linux 3.15, see
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl(2)</a> for more details.
