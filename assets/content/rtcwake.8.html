       This program is used to enter a system sleep state and to
       automatically wake from it at a specified time.

       This uses cross-platform Linux interfaces to enter a system sleep
       state, and leave it no later than a specified time. It uses any
       RTC framework driver that supports standard driver model wakeup
       flags.

       This is normally used like the old <b>apmsleep </b>utility, to wake from
       a suspend state like ACPI S1 (standby) or S3 (suspend-to-RAM).
       Most platforms can implement those without analogues of BIOS,
       APM, or ACPI.

       On some systems, this can also be used like <b>nvram-wakeup</b>, waking
       from states like ACPI S4 (suspend to disk). Not all systems have
       persistent media that are appropriate for such suspend modes.

       Note that alarm functionality depends on hardware; not every RTC
       is able to setup an alarm up to 24 hours in the future.

       The suspend setup may be interrupted by active hardware; for
       example wireless USB input devices that continue to send events
       for some fraction of a second after the return key is pressed.
       <b>rtcwake </b>tries to avoid this problem and it waits to terminal to
       settle down before entering a system sleep.
