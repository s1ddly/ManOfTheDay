       The <i>btrecord</i> and <i>btreplay</i> tools provide the ability to record and
       replay IOs captured by the <i>blktrace</i> utility. Attempts are made to
       maintain ordering, CPU mappings and time-separation of IOs.

       The <i>blktrace</i> utility provides the ability to collect detailed
       traces from the kernel for each IO processed by the block IO
       layer. The traces provide a complete timeline for each IO
       processed, including detailed information concerning when an IO
       was first received by the block IO layer — indicating the device,
       CPU number, time stamp, IO direction, sector number and IO size
       (number of sectors). Using this information, one is able to
       <b>replay </b>the IO again on the same machine or another set up
       entirely.

       The basic operating work-flow to replay IOs would be something
       like:

       -
           Run <i>blktrace</i> to collect traces. Here you specify the
           device or devices that you wish to trace and later replay IOs
         upon. Note:
           the only traces you are interested in are <b>QUEUE </b>requests —
           thus, to save system resources (including storage for
         traces), one could
           specify the <i>-a queue</i> command line option to <i>blktrace</i>.

       -
           While <i>blktrace</i> is running, you run the workload that you
           are interested in.

       -
           When the work load has completed, you stop the <i>blktrace</i>
           utility (thus saving all traces over the complete workload).

       -
           You extract the pertinent IO information from the traces
         saved by
           <i>blktrace</i> using the <i>btrecord</i> utility. This will parse
           each trace file created by <i>blktrace</i>, and crafty IO
         descriptions
           to be used in the next phase of the workload processing.

       -
           Once <i>btrecord</i> has successfully created a series of data
           files to be processed, you can run the <i>btreplay</i> utility which
           attempts to generate the same IOs seen during the sample
         workload phase.
