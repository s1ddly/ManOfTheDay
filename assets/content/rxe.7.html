       The rdma_rxe kernel module provides a software implementation of
       the RoCEv2 protocol. The RoCEv2 protocol is an RDMA transport
       protocol that exists on top of UDP/IPv4 or UDP/IPv6. The
       InfiniBand (IB) Base Transport Header (BTH) is encapsulated in
       the UDP packet.

       Once a RXE instance has been created, communicating via RXE is
       the same as communicating via any OFED compatible Infiniband HCA,
       albeit in some cases with addressing implications.

       In particular, while the use of a GRH header is optional within
       IB subnets, it is mandatory with RoCE.  Verbs applications
       written over IB verbs should work seamlessly, but they require
       provisioning of GRH information when creating address vectors.
       The library and driver are modified to provide for mapping from
       GID to MAC addresses required by the hardware.
