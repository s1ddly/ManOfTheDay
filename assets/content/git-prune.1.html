           <b>Note</b>
           In most cases, users should run <i>git gc</i>, which calls <i>git</i>
           <i>prune</i>. See the section "NOTES", below.

       This runs <i>git fsck --unreachable</i> using all the refs available in
       <b>refs/</b>, optionally with additional set of objects specified on the
       command line, and prunes all unpacked objects unreachable from
       any of these head objects from the object database. In addition,
       it prunes the unpacked objects that are also found in packs by
       running <i>git prune-packed</i>. It also removes entries from
       .git/shallow that are not reachable by any ref.

       Note that unreachable, packed objects will remain. If this is not
       desired, see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/git-repack.1.html">git-repack(1)</a>.
