       <i>git merge-file</i> incorporates all changes that lead from the
       <b>&lt;base-file&gt; </b>to <b>&lt;other-file&gt; </b>into <b>&lt;current-file&gt;</b>. The result
       ordinarily goes into <b>&lt;current-file&gt;</b>. <i>git merge-file</i> is useful for
       combining separate changes to an original. Suppose <b>&lt;base-file&gt; </b>is
       the original, and both <b>&lt;current-file&gt; </b>and <b>&lt;other-file&gt; </b>are
       modifications of <b>&lt;base-file&gt;</b>, then <i>git merge-file</i> combines both
       changes.

       A conflict occurs if both <b>&lt;current-file&gt; </b>and <b>&lt;other-file&gt; </b>have
       changes in a common segment of lines. If a conflict is found, <i>git</i>
       <i>merge-file</i> normally outputs a warning and brackets the conflict
       with lines containing &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; markers. A typical
       conflict will look like this:

           &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; A
           lines in file A
           =======
           lines in file B
           &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; B

       If there are conflicts, the user should edit the result and
       delete one of the alternatives. When <b>--ours</b>, <b>--theirs</b>, or <b>--union</b>
       option is in effect, however, these conflicts are resolved
       favouring lines from <b>&lt;current-file&gt;</b>, lines from <b>&lt;other-file&gt;</b>, or
       lines from both respectively. The length of the conflict markers
       can be given with the <b>--marker-size </b>option.

       The exit value of this program is negative on error, and the
       number of conflicts otherwise (truncated to 127 if there are more
       than that many conflicts). If the merge was clean, the exit value
       is 0.

       <i>git merge-file</i> is designed to be a minimal clone of RCS <i>merge</i>;
       that is, it implements all of RCS <i>merge</i>'s functionality which is
       needed by <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/git.1.html">git(1)</a>.
