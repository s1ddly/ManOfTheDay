       The <b>pidstat </b>command is used for monitoring individual tasks
       currently being managed by the Linux kernel.  It writes to
       standard output activities for every task selected with option <b>-p</b>
       or for every task managed by the Linux kernel if option <b>-p ALL</b>
       has been used. Not selecting any tasks is equivalent to
       specifying <b>-p ALL </b>but only active tasks (tasks with non-zero
       statistics values) will appear in the report.

       The <b>pidstat </b>command can also be used for monitoring the child
       processes of selected tasks.  Read about option <b>-T </b>below.

       The <i>interval</i> parameter specifies the amount of time in seconds
       between each report.  A value of 0 (or no parameters at all)
       indicates that tasks statistics are to be reported for the time
       since system startup (boot). The <i>count</i> parameter can be specified
       in conjunction with the <i>interval</i> parameter if this one is not set
       to zero. The value of <i>count</i> determines the number of reports
       generated at <i>interval</i> seconds apart. If the <i>interval</i> parameter is
       specified without the <i>count</i> parameter, the <b>pidstat </b>command
       generates reports continuously.

       You can select information about specific task activities using
       flags.  Not specifying any flags selects only CPU activity.
