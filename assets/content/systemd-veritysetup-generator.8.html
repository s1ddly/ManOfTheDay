       systemd-veritysetup-generator is a generator that translates
       kernel command line options configuring integrity-protected block
       devices (verity) into native systemd units early at boot and when
       configuration of the system manager is reloaded. This will create
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/systemd-veritysetup@.service.8.html">systemd-veritysetup@.service(8)</a> units as necessary.

       Currently, only a single verity device may be set up with this
       generator, backing the root file system of the OS.

       systemd-veritysetup-generator implements <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/systemd.generator.7.html">systemd.generator(7)</a>.
