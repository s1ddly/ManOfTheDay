       systemd-timedated.service is a system service that may be used as
       a mechanism to change the system clock and timezone, as well as
       to enable/disable network time synchronization.
       systemd-timedated is automatically activated on request and
       terminates itself when it is unused.

       The tool <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/timedatectl.1.html">timedatectl(1)</a> is a command line client to this service.

       systemd-timedated currently offers access to the following four
       settings:

       •   The system time

       •   The system timezone

       •   A boolean controlling whether the system RTC is in local or
           UTC timezone

       •   Whether the time synchronization service is enabled/started
           or disabled/stopped, see next section.

       See <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/org.freedesktop.timedate1.5.html">org.freedesktop.timedate1(5)</a> and
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/org.freedesktop.LogControl1.5.html">org.freedesktop.LogControl1(5)</a> for information about the D-Bus
       API.
