       The <i>cksum</i> utility shall calculate and write to standard output a
       cyclic redundancy check (CRC) for each input file, and also write
       to standard output the number of octets in each file. The CRC
       used is based on the polynomial used for CRC error checking in
       the ISO/IEC 8802‐3:1996 standard (Ethernet).

       The encoding for the CRC checksum is defined by the generating
       polynomial:

           <i>G</i>(<i>x</i>)=<i>x</i>32+<i>x</i>26+<i>x</i>23+<i>x</i>22+<i>x</i>16+<i>x</i>12+<i>x</i>11+<i>x</i>10+<i>x</i>8+<i>x</i>7+<i>x</i>5+<i>x</i>4+<i>x</i>2+<i>x</i>+1

       Mathematically, the CRC value corresponding to a given file shall
       be defined by the following procedure:

        1. The <i>n</i> bits to be evaluated are considered to be the
           coefficients of a mod 2 polynomial <i>M</i>(<i>x</i>) of degree <i>n</i>-1.  These
           <i>n</i> bits are the bits from the file, with the most significant
           bit being the most significant bit of the first octet of the
           file and the last bit being the least significant bit of the
           last octet, padded with zero bits (if necessary) to achieve
           an integral number of octets, followed by one or more octets
           representing the length of the file as a binary value, least
           significant octet first. The smallest number of octets
           capable of representing this integer shall be used.

        2. <i>M</i>(<i>x</i>) is multiplied by <i>x</i>32 (that is, shifted left 32 bits) and
           divided by <i>G</i>(<i>x</i>) using mod 2 division, producing a remainder
           <i>R</i>(<i>x</i>) of degree ≤ 31.

        3. The coefficients of <i>R</i>(<i>x</i>) are considered to be a 32-bit
           sequence.

        4. The bit sequence is complemented and the result is the CRC.
