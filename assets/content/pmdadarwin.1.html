       Each supported platform has a kernel Performance Metrics Domain
       Agent (PMDA) which extracts performance metrics from the kernel
       of that platfrom.  A variety of platform-specific metrics are
       available, with an equally varied set of access mechanisms -
       typically this involves special system calls, or reading from
       files in kernel virtual filesystems such as the Linux <i>sysfs</i> and
       <i>procfs</i> filesystems.

       The platform kernel PMDA is one of the most critical components
       of the PCP installation, and must be as efficient and reliable as
       possible.  In all installations the default kernel PMDA will be
       installed as a shared library and thus executes directly within
       the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> process.  This slightly reduces overheads associated
       with querying the metadata and values associated with these
       metrics (no message passing is required).

       Unlike many other PMDAs, the kernel PMDA exports a number of
       metric namespace subtrees, such as kernel, network, swap, mem,
       ipc, filesys, nfs, disk and hinv (hardware inventory).

       Despite usually running as shared libraries, most installations
       also include a stand-alone executable for the kernel PMDA.  This
       is to aid profiling and debugging activities, with <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dbpmda.1.html">dbpmda(1)</a> for
       example.  In this case (but not for shared libraries), the
       following command line options are available:

       <b>-d   </b>It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics <i>domain</i>
            number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is,
            <i>domain</i> should be different for every PMDA on the one host,
            and the same <i>domain</i> number should be used for the same PMDA
            on all hosts.

       <b>-l   </b>Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
            <i>[platform].log</i> is written in the current directory of
            <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> when <b>pmda[platform] </b>is started, i.e.
            <b>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd</b>.  If the log file cannot be created or is
            not writable, output is written to the standard error
            instead.

       <b>-U   </b>User account under which to run the agent.  The default is
            the unprivileged "pcp" account in current versions of PCP,
            but in older versions the superuser account ("root") was
            used by default.
