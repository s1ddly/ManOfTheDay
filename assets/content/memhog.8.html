       <b>memhog </b>mmaps a memory region for a given size and sets the numa
       policy (if specified).  It then updates the memory region for the
       given number of iterations using memset.

       -r&lt;num&gt;    Repeat memset NUM times
       -f&lt;file&gt;   Open file for mmap backing
       -H         Disable transparent hugepages
       -size      Allocation size in bytes, may have case-insensitive order
                  suffix (G=gigabyte, M=megabyte, K=kilobyte)

       Supported numa-policies:

       <b>interleave</b>
              Memory will be allocated using round robin on nodes. When
              memory cannot be allocated on the current interleave,
              target fall back to other nodes.  Multiple nodes may be
              specified.

       <b>membind</b>
              Only  allocate  memory  from  nodes. Allocation will fail
              when there is not enough memory available on these nodes.
              Multiple nodes  may be specified.

       <b>preferred</b>
              Preferably allocate memory on node, but if memory cannot
              be allocated  there  fall  back  to other nodes.  This
              option takes only a single node number.

       <b>default</b>
              Memory will be allocated on the local node (the node the
              thread is running on)
