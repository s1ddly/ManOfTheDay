       A submodule is a repository embedded inside another repository.
       The submodule has its own history; the repository it is embedded
       in is called a superproject.

       On the filesystem, a submodule usually (but not always - see
       FORMS below) consists of (i) a Git directory located under the
       <b>$GIT_DIR/modules/ </b>directory of its superproject, (ii) a working
       directory inside the superproject’s working directory, and a <b>.git</b>
       file at the root of the submodule’s working directory pointing to
       (i).

       Assuming the submodule has a Git directory at
       <b>$GIT_DIR/modules/foo/ </b>and a working directory at <b>path/to/bar/</b>,
       the superproject tracks the submodule via a <b>gitlink </b>entry in the
       tree at <b>path/to/bar </b>and an entry in its <b>.gitmodules </b>file (see
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/gitmodules.5.html">gitmodules(5)</a>) of the form <b>submodule.foo.path = path/to/bar</b>.

       The <b>gitlink </b>entry contains the object name of the commit that the
       superproject expects the submodule’s working directory to be at.

       The section <b>submodule.foo.* </b>in the <b>.gitmodules </b>file gives
       additional hints to Git’s porcelain layer. For example, the
       <b>submodule.foo.url </b>setting specifies where to obtain the
       submodule.

       Submodules can be used for at least two different use cases:

        1. Using another project while maintaining independent history.
           Submodules allow you to contain the working tree of another
           project within your own working tree while keeping the
           history of both projects separate. Also, since submodules are
           fixed to an arbitrary version, the other project can be
           independently developed without affecting the superproject,
           allowing the superproject project to fix itself to new
           versions only when desired.

        2. Splitting a (logically single) project into multiple
           repositories and tying them back together. This can be used
           to overcome current limitations of Git’s implementation to
           have finer grained access:

           •   Size of the Git repository: In its current form Git
               scales up poorly for large repositories containing
               content that is not compressed by delta computation
               between trees. For example, you can use submodules to
               hold large binary assets and these repositories can be
               shallowly cloned such that you do not have a large
               history locally.

           •   Transfer size: In its current form Git requires the whole
               working tree present. It does not allow partial trees to
               be transferred in fetch or clone. If the project you work
               on consists of multiple repositories tied together as
               submodules in a superproject, you can avoid fetching the
               working trees of the repositories you are not interested
               in.

           •   Access control: By restricting user access to submodules,
               this can be used to implement read/write policies for
               different users.
