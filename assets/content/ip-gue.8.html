       The <b>ip fou </b>commands are used to create and delete receive ports
       for Foo-over-UDP (FOU) as well as Generic UDP Encapsulation
       (GUE).

       Foo-over-UDP allows encapsulating packets of an IP protocol
       directly over UDP. The receiver infers the protocol of a packet
       received on a FOU UDP port to be the protocol configured for the
       port.

       Generic UDP Encapsulation (GUE) encapsulates packets of an IP
       protocol within UDP and an encapsulation header. The
       encapsulation header contains the IP protocol number for the
       encapsulated packet.

       When creating a FOU or GUE receive port, the port number is
       specified in <i>PORT</i> argument. If FOU is used, the IP protocol
       number associated with the port is specified in <i>PROTO</i> argument.
       You can bind a port to a local address/interface, by specifying
       the address in the local <i>IFADDR</i> argument or the device in the
       <i>IFNAME</i> argument. If you would like to connect the port, you can
       specify the peer address in the peer <i>IFADDR</i> argument and peer
       port in the peer_port <i>PORT</i> argument.

       A FOU or GUE receive port is deleted by specifying <i>PORT</i> in the
       delete command, as well as local address/interface or peer
       address/port (if set).
