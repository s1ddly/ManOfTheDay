       The <i>write</i> utility shall read lines from the standard input and
       write them to the terminal of the specified user. When first
       invoked, it shall write the message:

           <b>Message from </b><i>sender-login-id</i> (<i>sending-terminal</i>) <b>[</b><i>date</i><b>]</b>...

       to <i>user_name</i>.  When it has successfully completed the connection,
       the sender's terminal shall be alerted twice to indicate that
       what the sender is typing is being written to the recipient's
       terminal.

       If the recipient wants to reply, this can be accomplished by
       typing:

           write <i>sender-login-id</i> <b>[</b><i>sending-terminal</i><b>]</b>

       upon receipt of the initial message. Whenever a line of input as
       delimited by an NL, EOF, or EOL special character (see the Base
       Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Chapter 11</i>, <i>General Terminal</i>
       <i>Interface</i>) is accumulated while in canonical input mode, the
       accumulated data shall be written on the other user's terminal.
       Characters shall be processed as follows:

        *  Typing &lt;alert&gt; shall write the &lt;alert&gt; character to the
           recipient's terminal.

        *  Typing the erase and kill characters shall affect the
           sender's terminal in the manner described by the <b>termios</b>
           interface in the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017,
           <i>Chapter 11</i>, <i>General Terminal Interface</i>.

        *  Typing the interrupt or end-of-file characters shall cause
           <i>write</i> to write an appropriate message (<b>"EOT\n" </b>in the POSIX
           locale) to the recipient's terminal and exit.

        *  Typing characters from <i>LC_CTYPE</i> classifications <b>print </b>or
           <b>space </b>shall cause those characters to be sent to the
           recipient's terminal.

        *  When and only when the <i>stty</i> <b>iexten </b>local mode is enabled, the
           existence and processing of additional special control
           characters and multi-byte or single-byte functions is
           implementation-defined.

        *  Typing other non-printable characters shall cause
           implementation-defined sequences of printable characters to
           be written to the recipient's terminal.

       To write to a user who is logged in more than once, the <i>terminal</i>
       argument can be used to indicate which terminal to write to;
       otherwise, the recipient's terminal is selected in an
       implementation-defined manner and an informational message is
       written to the sender's standard output, indicating which
       terminal was chosen.

       Permission to be a recipient of a <i>write</i> message can be denied or
       granted by use of the <i>mesg</i> utility. However, a user's privilege
       may further constrain the domain of accessibility of other users'
       terminals. The <i>write</i> utility shall fail when the user lacks
       appropriate privileges to perform the requested action.
