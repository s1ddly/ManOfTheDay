       The rsync-ssl script helps you to run an rsync copy to/from an
       rsync daemon that requires ssl connections.

       The script requires that you specify an rsync-daemon arg in the
       style of either <b>hostname:: </b>(with 2 colons) or <b>rsync://hostname/</b>.
       The default port used for connecting is 874 (one higher than the
       normal 873) unless overridden in the environment.  You can
       specify an overriding port via <b>--port </b>or by including it in the
       normal spot in the URL format, though both of those require your
       rsync version to be at least 3.2.0.
