       <b>id128 </b>may be used to conveniently print <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/sd-id128.3.html">sd-id128(3)</a> UUIDs. What
       identifier is printed depends on the specific verb.

       With <b>new</b>, a new random identifier will be generated.

       With <b>machine-id</b>, the identifier of the current machine will be
       printed. See <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/machine-id.5.html">machine-id(5)</a>.

       With <b>boot-id</b>, the identifier of the current boot will be printed.

       Both <b>machine-id </b>and <b>boot-id </b>may be combined with the
       <b>--app-specific=</b><i>app-id</i> switch to generate application-specific
       IDs. See <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/sd_id128_get_machine.3.html">sd_id128_get_machine(3)</a> for the discussion when this is
       useful.

       With <b>invocation-id</b>, the identifier of the current service
       invocation will be printed. This is available in systemd
       services. See <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/systemd.exec.5.html">systemd.exec(5)</a>.

       With <b>show</b>, well-known UUIDs are printed. When no arguments are
       specified, all known UUIDs are shown. When arguments are
       specified, they must be the names or values of one or more known
       UUIDs, which are then printed.
