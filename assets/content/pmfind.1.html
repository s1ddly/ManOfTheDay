       <b>pmfind </b>searches for instances of the specified PCP service being
       advertised on the network and prints a list of URLs corresponding
       to the services discovered.  It can be used in conjunction with
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmfind_check.1.html">pmfind_check(1)</a> to automate the monitoring of remote PCP
       collector systems.
