       <b>yum-debug-dump </b>is a program which creates a gzipped file
       containing a lot of information useful to developers trying to
       debug a problem.

       By default it will output a file to the current working directory
       named yum_debug_dump-&lt;hostname&gt;-&lt;time&gt;.txt.gz. This file contains
       no private information but does contain a complete list of all
       packages you have installed, all packages available in any
       repository, important configuration and system information.  You
       can view this file using the 'zless' command.

       You can use the coresponding program <b>yum-debug-restore </b>to act on
       this file and restore a set of packages (much like dump/restore).
