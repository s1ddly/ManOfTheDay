       <b>mkfs.fat </b>is used to create a FAT filesystem on a device or in an
       image file.  <i>DEVICE</i> is the special file corresponding to the
       device (e.g. /dev/sdXX) or the image file (which does not need to
       exist when the option <b>-C </b>is given).  <i>BLOCK-COUNT</i> is the number of
       blocks on the device and size of one block is always 1024 bytes,
       independently of the sector size or the cluster size.  Therefore
       <i>BLOCK-COUNT</i> specifies size of filesystem in KiB unit and not in
       the number of sectors (like for all other <b>mkfs.fat </b>options).  If
       omitted, <b>mkfs.fat </b>automatically chooses a filesystem size to fill
       the available space.

       Two different variants of the FAT filesystem are supported.
       Standard is the FAT12, FAT16 and FAT32 filesystems as defined by
       Microsoft and widely used on hard disks and removable media like
       USB sticks and SD cards.  The other is the legacy Atari variant
       used on Atari ST.

       In Atari mode, if not directed otherwise by the user, <b>mkfs.fat</b>
       will always use 2 sectors per cluster, since GEMDOS doesn't like
       other values very much.  It will also obey the maximum number of
       sectors GEMDOS can handle.  Larger filesystems are managed by
       raising the logical sector size.  An Atari-compatible serial
       number for the filesystem is generated, and a 12 bit FAT is used
       only for filesystems that have one of the usual floppy sizes
       (720k, 1.2M, 1.44M, 2.88M), a 16 bit FAT otherwise.  This can be
       overridden with the <b>-F </b>option.  Some PC-specific boot sector
       fields aren't written, and a boot message (option <b>-m</b>) is ignored.
