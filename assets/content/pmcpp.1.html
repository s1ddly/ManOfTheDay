       <b>pmcpp </b>provides a very simple pre-processor originally designed
       for manipulating Performance Metric Name Space (PMNS) files for
       the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP), but later generalized to provide
       conditional blocks, include file processing, in-line shell
       command execution and macro substitution for arbitrary files.  It
       is most commonly used internally to process the PMNS file(s)
       after <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/pmLoadNameSpace.3.html">pmLoadNameSpace(3)</a> or <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/pmLoadASCIINameSpace.3.html">pmLoadASCIINameSpace(3)</a> is called and
       to pre-process the configuration files for <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a>.

       Input lines are read from <i>infile</i> (or standard input if <i>infile</i> is
       not specified), processed and written to standard output.

       All C-style comments of the form /* ... */ are stripped from the
       input stream.

       There are no predefined macros for <b>pmcpp </b>although macros may be
       defined on the command line using the <b>-D </b>option, where <i>name</i> and
       <i>value</i> must follow the same rules as described below for the
       <b>#define </b>directive.

       <b>pmcpp </b>accepts the following directives in the input stream (like
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/cpp.1.html">cpp(1)</a>):

       •  <b>#include "</b><i>filename</i><b>"</b>
          or
          <b>#include &lt;</b><i>filename</i><b>&gt;</b>
          In either case the directory search path for <i>filename</i> tries
          <i>filename</i> first, then the directory for the command line <i>infile</i>
          (if any), followed by any directories named in <b>-I </b>command line
          arguments, and finally the <b>$PCP_VAR_DIR/pmns </b>directory (the
          latter is for backwards compatibility with earlier versions of
          <b>pmcpp </b>and the implied used from <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/pmLoadASCIINameSpace.3.html">pmLoadASCIINameSpace(3)</a>).
          <b>#include </b>directives may be nested, up to a maximum depth of 5.

       •  <b>#shell "</b><i>command</i><b>"</b>
          or
          <b>#shell '</b><i>command</i><b>'</b>
          <b>The shell </b><i>command</i> will be executed and the standard output is
          inserted into the stream of data to be processed by <b>pmcpp</b>.
          Functionally this is similar to a <b>#include </b>directive, except
          input lines are read from a <i>command</i> rather than a file.  The
          <b>#shell </b>directive is most useful for including or excluding
          <b>#define </b>or <b>#undef </b>directives based on run-time logic in the
          <i>command</i>.

       •  <b>#define </b><i>name value</i>
          or
          <b>#define </b><i>name</i> <b>"</b><i>value</i><b>"</b>
          or
          <b>#define </b><i>name</i> <b>'</b><i>value</i><b>'</b>
          Defines a value for the macro <i>name</i> which must be a valid C-
          style name, so leading alphabetic or underscore followed by
          zero or more alphanumerics or underscores.  <i>value</i> is optional
          (and defaults to an empty string).  There is no character
          escape mechanism, but either single quotes or double quotes
          may be used to define a <i>value</i> with special characters or
          embedded horizontal white space (no newlines).

       •  <b>#undef </b><i>name</i>
          Removes the macro definition, if any, for <i>name</i>.

       •  <b>#ifdef </b><i>name</i>
          ...
          <b>#endif</b>
          or
          <b>#ifndef </b><i>name</i>
          ...
          <b>#endif</b>
          The enclosing lines will be stripped or included, depending if
          the macro <i>name</i> is defined or not.

       •  <b>#else</b>
          Within a <b>#ifdef </b>or <b>#ifndef </b>block, <b>#else </b>may be used to delimit
          lines to be included if the preceding ``if'' condition is
          false.

       Macro substitution is achieved by breaking the input stream into
       words separated by white space or characters that are not valid
       in a macro name, i.e. not alphanumeric and not underscore.  Each
       word is checked and if it matches a macro name, the word is
       replaced by the macro value, otherwise the word is unchanged.

       There is generally one output line for each input line, although
       the line may be empty if the text has been stripped due to the
       handling of comments or conditional directives.  When there is a
       change in the input stream, an additional output line is
       generated of the form:

                 # lineno "filename"

       to indicate the <i>following</i> line of output corresponds to line
       number <i>lineno</i> of the input file <i>filename</i>.
