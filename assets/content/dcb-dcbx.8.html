       Data Center Bridging eXchange (DCBX) is a protocol used by DCB
       devices to exchange configuration information with directly
       connected peers. The Linux DCBX object is a 1-byte bitfield of
       flags that configure whether DCBX is implemented in the device or
       in the host, and which version of the protocol should be used.
       <b>dcb dcbx </b>is used to access the per-port Linux DCBX object.

       There are two principal modes of operation: in <b>host </b>mode, DCBX
       protocol is implemented by the host LLDP agent, and the DCB
       interfaces are used to propagate the negotiate parameters to
       capable devices. In <b>lld-managed </b>mode, the configuration is
       handled by the device, and DCB interfaces are used for inspection
       of negotiated parameters, and can also be used to set initial
       parameters.
