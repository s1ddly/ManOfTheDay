       POSIX semaphores allow processes and threads to synchronize their
       actions.

       A semaphore is an integer whose value is never allowed to fall
       below zero.  Two operations can be performed on semaphores:
       increment the semaphore value by one (<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/sem_post.3.html">sem_post(3)</a>); and decrement
       the semaphore value by one (<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/sem_wait.3.html">sem_wait(3)</a>).  If the value of a
       semaphore is currently zero, then a <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/sem_wait.3.html">sem_wait(3)</a> operation will
       block until the value becomes greater than zero.

       POSIX semaphores come in two forms: named semaphores and unnamed
       semaphores.

       <b>Named semaphores</b>
              A named semaphore is identified by a name of the form
              <i>/somename</i>; that is, a null-terminated string of up to
              <b>NAME_MAX</b><i>-4</i> (i.e., 251) characters consisting of an initial
              slash, followed by one or more characters, none of which
              are slashes.  Two processes can operate on the same named
              semaphore by passing the same name to <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/sem_open.3.html">sem_open(3)</a>.

              The <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/sem_open.3.html">sem_open(3)</a> function creates a new named semaphore or
              opens an existing named semaphore.  After the semaphore
              has been opened, it can be operated on using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/sem_post.3.html">sem_post(3)</a>
              and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/sem_wait.3.html">sem_wait(3)</a>.  When a process has finished using the
              semaphore, it can use <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/sem_close.3.html">sem_close(3)</a> to close the semaphore.
              When all processes have finished using the semaphore, it
              can be removed from the system using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/sem_unlink.3.html">sem_unlink(3)</a>.

       <b>Unnamed semaphores (memory-based semaphores)</b>
              An unnamed semaphore does not have a name.  Instead the
              semaphore is placed in a region of memory that is shared
              between multiple threads (a <i>thread-shared semaphore</i>) or
              processes (a <i>process-shared semaphore</i>).  A thread-shared
              semaphore is placed in an area of memory shared between
              the threads of a process, for example, a global variable.
              A process-shared semaphore must be placed in a shared
              memory region (e.g., a System V shared memory segment
              created using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/shmget.2.html">shmget(2)</a>, or a POSIX shared memory object
              built created using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/shm_open.3.html">shm_open(3)</a>).

              Before being used, an unnamed semaphore must be
              initialized using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/sem_init.3.html">sem_init(3)</a>.  It can then be operated on
              using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/sem_post.3.html">sem_post(3)</a> and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/sem_wait.3.html">sem_wait(3)</a>.  When the semaphore is
              no longer required, and before the memory in which it is
              located is deallocated, the semaphore should be destroyed
              using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/sem_destroy.3.html">sem_destroy(3)</a>.

       The remainder of this section describes some specific details of
       the Linux implementation of POSIX semaphores.

   <b>Versions</b>
       Prior to kernel 2.6, Linux supported only unnamed, thread-shared
       semaphores.  On a system with Linux 2.6 and a glibc that provides
       the NPTL threading implementation, a complete implementation of
       POSIX semaphores is provided.

   <b>Persistence</b>
       POSIX named semaphores have kernel persistence: if not removed by
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/sem_unlink.3.html">sem_unlink(3)</a>, a semaphore will exist until the system is shut
       down.

   <b>Linking</b>
       Programs using the POSIX semaphores API must be compiled with <i>cc</i>
       <i>-pthread</i> to link against the real-time library, <i>librt</i>.

   <b>Accessing named semaphores via the filesystem</b>
       On Linux, named semaphores are created in a virtual filesystem,
       normally mounted under <i>/dev/shm</i>, with names of the form
       <b>sem.</b><i>somename</i>.  (This is the reason that semaphore names are
       limited to <b>NAME_MAX</b><i>-4</i> rather than <b>NAME_MAX </b>characters.)

       Since Linux 2.6.19, ACLs can be placed on files under this
       directory, to control object permissions on a per-user and per-
       group basis.
