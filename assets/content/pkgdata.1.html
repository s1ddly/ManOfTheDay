       <b>pkgdata </b>takes a set of data files and packages them for use by
       ICU or applications that use ICU. The typical reason to package
       files using <b>pkgdata </b>is to make their distribution easier and
       their loading by ICU faster and less consuming of limited system
       resources such as file descriptors.  Packaged data also allow
       applications to be distributed with fewer resource files, or even
       with none at all if they link against the packaged data directly.

       <b>pkgdata </b>supports a few different methods of packaging data that
       serve different purposes.

       The default packaging <i>mode</i> is <b>common</b>, or <b>archive</b>.  In this mode,
       the different data files are bundled together as an architecture-
       dependent file that can later be memory mapped for use by ICU.
       Data packaged using this mode will be looked up under the ICU
       data directory. Such packaging is easy to use for applications
       resource bundles, for example, as long as the application can
       install the packaged file in the ICU data directory.

       Another packaging mode is the <b>dll</b>, or <b>library</b>, mode, where the
       data files are compiled into a shared library. ICU used to be
       able to dynamically load these shared libraries, but as of ICU
       2.0, such support has been removed. This mode is still useful for
       two main purposes: to build ICU itself, as the ICU data is
       packaged as a shared library by default; and to build resource
       bundles that are linked to the application that uses them. Such
       resource bundles can then be placed anywhere where the system's
       dynamic linker will be looking for shared libraries, instead of
       being forced to live inside the ICU data directory.

       The <b>static </b>packaging mode is similar to the shared library one
       except that it produces a static library.

       Finally, <b>pkgdata </b>supports a <b>files </b>mode which simply copies the
       data files instead of packaging them as a single file or library.
       This mode is mainly intended to provide support for building ICU
       before it is packaged as separate small packages for distribution
       with operating systems such as Debian GNU/Linux for example.
       Please refer to the packaging documentation in the ICU source
       distribution for further information on the use of this mode.

       <b>pkgdata </b>builds, packages, installs, or cleans the appropriate
       data based on the options given without the need to call GNU <b>make</b>
       anymore.
