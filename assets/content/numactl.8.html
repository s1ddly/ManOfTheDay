       <b>numactl </b>runs processes with a specific NUMA scheduling or memory
       placement policy.  The policy is set for command and inherited by
       all of its children.  In addition it can set persistent policy
       for shared memory segments or files.

       Use -- before command if using command options that could be
       confused with numactl options.

       <i>nodes</i> may be specified as N,N,N or  N-N or N,N-N or  N-N,N-N and
       so forth.  Relative <i>nodes</i> may be specified as +N,N,N or  +N-N or
       +N,N-N and so forth. The + indicates that the node numbers are
       relative to the process' set of allowed nodes in its current
       cpuset.  A !N-N notation indicates the inverse of N-N, in other
       words all nodes except N-N.  If used with + notation, specify
       !+N-N. When <i>same</i> is specified the previous nodemask specified on
       the command line is used.  all means all nodes in the current
       cpuset.

       Instead of a number a node can also be:

       netdev:DEV                 The node connected to network device DEV.
       file:PATH                  The node the block device of PATH.
       ip:HOST                    The node of the network device of HOST
       block:PATH                 The node of block device PATH
       pci:[seg:]bus:dev[:func]   The node of a PCI device.

       Note that block resolves the kernel block device names only for
       udev names in /dev use <i>file:</i>

       Policy settings are:

       <b>--all, -a</b>
              Unset default cpuset awareness, so user can use all
              possible CPUs/nodes for following policy settings.

       <b>--interleave=nodes, -i nodes</b>
              Set a memory interleave policy. Memory will be allocated
              using round robin on <i>nodes.</i>  When memory cannot be
              allocated on the current interleave target fall back to
              other nodes.  Multiple nodes may be specified on
              --interleave, --membind and --cpunodebind.

       <b>--membind=nodes, -m nodes</b>
              Only allocate memory from nodes.  Allocation will fail
              when there is not enough memory available on these nodes.
              <i>nodes</i> may be specified as noted above.

       <b>--cpunodebind=nodes, -N nodes</b>
              Only execute <i>command</i> on the CPUs of <i>nodes.</i>  Note that
              nodes may consist of multiple CPUs.  <i>nodes</i> may be
              specified as noted above.

       <b>--physcpubind=cpus, -C cpus</b>
              Only execute <i>process</i> on <i>cpus.</i>  This accepts cpu numbers as
              shown in the <i>processor</i> fields of <i>/proc/cpuinfo,</i> or
              relative cpus as in relative to the current cpuset.  You
              may specify "all", which means all cpus in the current
              cpuset.  Physical <i>cpus</i> may be specified as N,N,N or  N-N
              or N,N-N or  N-N,N-N and so forth.  Relative <i>cpus</i> may be
              specified as +N,N,N or  +N-N or +N,N-N and so forth. The +
              indicates that the cpu numbers are relative to the
              process' set of allowed cpus in its current cpuset.  A !N-
              N notation indicates the inverse of N-N, in other words
              all cpus except N-N.  If used with + notation, specify
              !+N-N.

       <b>--localalloc, -l</b>
              Try to allocate on the current node of the process, but if
              memory cannot be allocated there fall back to other nodes.

       <b>--preferred=node</b>
              Preferably allocate memory on <i>node,</i> but if memory cannot
              be allocated there fall back to other nodes.  This option
              takes only a single node number.  Relative notation may be
              used.

       <b>--balancing, -b</b>
              Enable Linux kernel NUMA balancing for the process if it
              is supported by kernel.  This should only be used with
              <i>--membind, -m</i> only, otherwise ignored.

       <b>--show, -s</b>
              Show NUMA policy settings of the current process.

       <b>--hardware, -H</b>
              Show inventory of available nodes on the system.

       Numactl can set up policy for a SYSV shared memory segment or a
       file in shmfs/hugetlbfs.

       This policy is persistent and will be used by all mappings from
       that shared memory. The order of options matters here.  The
       specification must at least include either of <i>--shm, --shmid,</i>
       <i>--file</i> to specify the shared memory segment or file and a memory
       policy like described above ( <i>--interleave, --localalloc,</i>
       <i>--preferred, --membind</i> ).

       <b>--huge</b>
       When creating a SYSV shared memory segment use huge pages.  Only
       valid before --shmid or --shm

       <b>--offset</b>
       Specify offset into the shared memory segment. Default 0.  Valid
       units are <i>m</i> (for MB), <i>g</i> (for GB), <i>k</i> (for KB), otherwise it
       specifies bytes.

       <b>--strict</b>
       Give an error when a page in the policied area in the shared
       memory segment already was faulted in with a conflicting policy.
       Default is to silently ignore this.

       <b>--shmmode shmmode</b>
       Only valid before --shmid or --shm When creating a shared memory
       segment set it to numeric mode <i>shmmode.</i>

       <b>--length length</b>
       Apply policy to <i>length</i> range in the shared memory segment or make
       the segment length long Default is to use the remaining length
       Required when a shared memory segment is created and specifies
       the length of the new segment then. Valid units are <i>m</i> (for MB), <i>g</i>
       (for GB), <i>k</i> (for KB), otherwise it specifies bytes.

       <b>--shmid id</b>
       Create or use a shared memory segment with numeric ID <i>id</i>

       <b>--shm shmkeyfile</b>
       Create or use a shared memory segment, with the ID generated
       using <b>ftok(3) </b>from shmkeyfile

       <b>--file tmpfsfile</b>
       Set policy for a file in tmpfs or hugetlbfs

       <b>--touch</b>
       Touch pages to enforce policy early. Default is to not touch
       them, the policy is applied when an applications maps and
       accesses a page.

       <b>--dump</b>
       Dump policy in the specified range.

       <b>--dump-nodes</b>
       Dump all nodes of the specific range (very verbose!)

       Valid node specifiers

       all                 All nodes
       number              Node number
       number1{,number2}   Node number1 and Node number2
       number1-number2     Nodes from number1 to number2
       ! nodes             Invert selection of the following specification.
