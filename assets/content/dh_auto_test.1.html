       <b>dh_auto_test </b>is a debhelper program that tries to automatically
       run a package's test suite. It does so by running the appropriate
       command for the build system it detects the package uses. For
       example, if there's a Makefile and it contains a <b>test </b>or <b>check</b>
       target, then this is done by running <b>make </b>(or <b>MAKE</b>, if the
       environment variable is set). If the test suite fails, the
       command will exit nonzero. If there's no test suite, it will exit
       zero without doing anything.

       This is intended to work for about 90% of packages with a test
       suite. If it doesn't work, you're encouraged to skip using
       <b>dh_auto_test </b>at all, and just run the test suite manually.
