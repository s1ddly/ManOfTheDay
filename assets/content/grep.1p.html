<pre>
       The <i>grep</i> utility shall search the input files, selecting lines
       matching one or more patterns; the types of patterns are
       controlled by the options specified. The patterns are specified
       by the <b>-e </b>option, <b>-f </b>option, or the <i>pattern_list</i> operand. The
       <i>pattern_list</i>'s value shall consist of one or more patterns
       separated by &lt;newline&gt; characters; the <i>pattern_file</i>'s contents
       shall consist of one or more patterns terminated by a &lt;newline&gt;
       character. By default, an input line shall be selected if any
       pattern, treated as an entire basic regular expression (BRE) as
       described in the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‚Äê2017, <i>Section</i>
       <i>9.3</i>, <i>Basic Regular Expressions</i>, matches any part of the line
       excluding the terminating &lt;newline&gt;; a null BRE shall match every
       line. By default, each selected input line shall be written to
       the standard output.

       Regular expression matching shall be based on text lines. Since a
       &lt;newline&gt; separates or terminates patterns (see the <b>-e </b>and <b>-f</b>
       options below), regular expressions cannot contain a &lt;newline&gt;.
       Similarly, since patterns are matched against individual lines
       (excluding the terminating &lt;newline&gt; characters) of the input,
       there is no way for a pattern to match a &lt;newline&gt; found in the
       input.
