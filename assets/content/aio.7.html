       The POSIX asynchronous I/O (AIO) interface allows applications to
       initiate one or more I/O operations that are performed
       asynchronously (i.e., in the background).  The application can
       elect to be notified of completion of the I/O operation in a
       variety of ways: by delivery of a signal, by instantiation of a
       thread, or no notification at all.

       The POSIX AIO interface consists of the following functions:

       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/aio_read.3.html">aio_read(3)</a>
              Enqueue a read request.  This is the asynchronous analog
              of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/read.2.html">read(2)</a>.

       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/aio_write.3.html">aio_write(3)</a>
              Enqueue a write request.  This is the asynchronous analog
              of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/write.2.html">write(2)</a>.

       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/aio_fsync.3.html">aio_fsync(3)</a>
              Enqueue a sync request for the I/O operations on a file
              descriptor.  This is the asynchronous analog of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fsync.2.html">fsync(2)</a>
              and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fdatasync.2.html">fdatasync(2)</a>.

       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/aio_error.3.html">aio_error(3)</a>
              Obtain the error status of an enqueued I/O request.

       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/aio_return.3.html">aio_return(3)</a>
              Obtain the return status of a completed I/O request.

       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/aio_suspend.3.html">aio_suspend(3)</a>
              Suspend the caller until one or more of a specified set of
              I/O requests completes.

       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/aio_cancel.3.html">aio_cancel(3)</a>
              Attempt to cancel outstanding I/O requests on a specified
              file descriptor.

       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/lio_listio.3.html">lio_listio(3)</a>
              Enqueue multiple I/O requests using a single function
              call.

       The <i>aiocb</i> ("asynchronous I/O control block") structure defines
       parameters that control an I/O operation.  An argument of this
       type is employed with all of the functions listed above.  This
       structure has the following form:

           #include &lt;aiocb.h&gt;

           struct aiocb {
               /* The order of these fields is implementation-dependent */

               int             aio_fildes;     /* File descriptor */
               off_t           aio_offset;     /* File offset */
               volatile void  *aio_buf;        /* Location of buffer */
               size_t          aio_nbytes;     /* Length of transfer */
               int             aio_reqprio;    /* Request priority */
               struct sigevent aio_sigevent;   /* Notification method */
               int             aio_lio_opcode; /* Operation to be performed;
                                                  lio_listio() only */

               /* Various implementation-internal fields not shown */
           };

           /* Operation codes for 'aio_lio_opcode': */

           enum { LIO_READ, LIO_WRITE, LIO_NOP };

       The fields of this structure are as follows:

       <i>aio_fildes</i>
              The file descriptor on which the I/O operation is to be
              performed.

       <i>aio_offset</i>
              This is the file offset at which the I/O operation is to
              be performed.

       <i>aio_buf</i>
              This is the buffer used to transfer data for a read or
              write operation.

       <i>aio_nbytes</i>
              This is the size of the buffer pointed to by <i>aio_buf</i>.

       <i>aio_reqprio</i>
              This field specifies a value that is subtracted from the
              calling thread's real-time priority in order to determine
              the priority for execution of this I/O request (see
              <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/pthread_setschedparam.3.html">pthread_setschedparam(3)</a>).  The specified value must be
              between 0 and the value returned by
              <i>sysconf(_SC_AIO_PRIO_DELTA_MAX)</i>.  This field is ignored
              for file synchronization operations.

       <i>aio_sigevent</i>
              This field is a structure that specifies how the caller is
              to be notified when the asynchronous I/O operation
              completes.  Possible values for <i>aio_sigevent.sigev_notify</i>
              are <b>SIGEV_NONE</b>, <b>SIGEV_SIGNAL</b>, and <b>SIGEV_THREAD</b>.  See
              <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/sigevent.7.html">sigevent(7)</a> for further details.

       <i>aio_lio_opcode</i>
              The type of operation to be performed; used only for
              <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/lio_listio.3.html">lio_listio(3)</a>.

       In addition to the standard functions listed above, the GNU C
       library provides the following extension to the POSIX AIO API:

       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/aio_init.3.html">aio_init(3)</a>
              Set parameters for tuning the behavior of the glibc POSIX
              AIO implementation.
