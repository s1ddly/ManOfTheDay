       <b>addr2line </b>translates addresses into file names and line numbers.
       Given an address in an executable or an offset in a section of a
       relocatable object, it uses the debugging information to figure
       out which file name and line number are associated with it.

       The executable or relocatable object to use is specified with the
       <b>-e </b>option.  The default is the file <i>a.out</i>.  The section in the
       relocatable object to use is specified with the <b>-j </b>option.

       <b>addr2line </b>has two modes of operation.

       In the first, hexadecimal addresses are specified on the command
       line, and <b>addr2line </b>displays the file name and line number for
       each address.

       In the second, <b>addr2line </b>reads hexadecimal addresses from
       standard input, and prints the file name and line number for each
       address on standard output.  In this mode, <b>addr2line </b>may be used
       in a pipe to convert dynamically chosen addresses.

       The format of the output is <b>FILENAME:LINENO</b>.  By default each
       input address generates one line of output.

       Two options can generate additional lines before each
       <b>FILENAME:LINENO </b>line (in that order).

       If the <b>-a </b>option is used then a line with the input address is
       displayed.

       If the <b>-f </b>option is used, then a line with the <b>FUNCTIONNAME </b>is
       displayed.  This is the name of the function containing the
       address.

       One option can generate additional lines after the
       <b>FILENAME:LINENO </b>line.

       If the <b>-i </b>option is used and the code at the given address is
       present there because of inlining by the compiler then additional
       lines are displayed afterwards.  One or two extra lines (if the
       <b>-f </b>option is used) are displayed for each inlined function.

       Alternatively if the <b>-p </b>option is used then each input address
       generates a single, long, output line containing the address, the
       function name, the file name and the line number.  If the <b>-i</b>
       option has also been used then any inlined functions will be
       displayed in the same manner, but on separate lines, and prefixed
       by the text <b>(inlined by)</b>.

       If the file name or function name can not be determined,
       <b>addr2line </b>will print two question marks in their place.  If the
       line number can not be determined, <b>addr2line </b>will print 0.
