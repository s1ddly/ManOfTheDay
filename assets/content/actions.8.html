<pre>
       The <b>actions </b>object in <b>tc </b>allows a user to define actions
       independently of a classifier (filter). These actions can then be
       assigned to one or more filters, with any packets matching the
       classifier's criteria having that action performed on them.

       Each action type (mirred, police, etc.) will have its own table
       to store all created actions.
