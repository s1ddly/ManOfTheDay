       <b>ip nexthop </b>is used to manipulate entries in the kernel's nexthop
       tables.

       ip nexthop add id ID
              add new nexthop entry

       ip nexthop replace id ID
              change the configuration of a nexthop or add new one

              <b>via </b><i>[ FAMILY ] ADDRESS</i>
                     the address of the nexthop router, in the address
                     family FAMILY.  Address family must match address
                     family of nexthop instance.

              <b>dev </b><i>NAME</i>
                     is the output device.

              <b>onlink </b>pretend that the nexthop is directly attached to
                     this link, even if it does not match any interface
                     prefix.

              <b>encap </b><i>ENCAPTYPE ENCAPHDR</i>
                     attach tunnel encapsulation attributes to this
                     route.

                     <i>ENCAPTYPE</i> is a string specifying the supported
                     encapsulation type. Namely:

                             <b>mpls </b>- encapsulation type MPLS

                     <i>ENCAPHDR</i> is a set of encapsulation attributes
                     specific to the <i>ENCAPTYPE.</i>

                             <b>mpls</b>
                               <i>MPLSLABEL</i> - mpls label stack with labels
                               separated by <i>/</i>

                               <b>ttl </b><i>TTL</i> - TTL to use for MPLS header or 0
                               to inherit from IP header

              <b>group </b><i>GROUP [</i> <b>type </b><i>TYPE [ TYPE_ARGS ] ]</i>
                     create a nexthop group. Group specification is id
                     with an optional weight (id,weight) and a '/' as a
                     separator between entries.

                     <i>TYPE</i> is a string specifying the nexthop group type.
                     Namely:

                             <b>mpath </b>- Multipath nexthop group backed by
                             the hash-threshold algorithm. The default
                             when the type is unspecified.

                             <b>resilient </b>- Resilient nexthop group. Group
                             is resilient to addition and deletion of
                             nexthops.

                     <i>TYPE_ARGS</i> is a set of attributes specific to the
                     <i>TYPE.</i>

                             <b>resilient</b>
                               <b>buckets </b><i>BUCKETS</i> - Number of nexthop
                               buckets. Cannot be changed for an
                               existing group

                               <b>idle_timer </b><i>IDLE</i> - Time in seconds in
                               which a nexthop bucket does not see
                               traffic and is therefore considered idle.
                               Default is 120 seconds

                               <b>unbalanced_timer </b><i>UNBALANCED</i> - Time in
                               seconds in which a nexthop group is
                               unbalanced and is therefore considered
                               unbalanced. The kernel will try to
                               rebalance unbalanced groups, which might
                               result in some flows being reset. A value
                               of 0 means that no rebalancing will take
                               place. Default is 0 seconds

              <b>blackhole</b>
                     create a blackhole nexthop

              <b>fdb    </b>nexthop and nexthop groups for use with layer-2 fdb
                     entries.  A fdb nexthop group can only have fdb
                     nexthops.  Example: Used to represent a vxlan
                     remote vtep ip. layer-2 vxlan fdb entry pointing to
                     an ecmp nexthop group containing multiple remote
