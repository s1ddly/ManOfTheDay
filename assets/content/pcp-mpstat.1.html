       <b>pcp-mpstat </b>command writes to standard output activities for each
       available processor, processor 0 being the first one.  If no
       activity/option has been selected, then the default report is the
       CPU utilization (<b>-u</b>) report.

       The <i>interval</i> parameter specifies the amount of time in seconds
       between each report.  The default is one second.  The value of
       <i>count</i> parameter determines the number of samples to be displayed.
       The default is continous.
