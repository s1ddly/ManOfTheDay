       <b>pmdabash </b>is an experimental Performance Metrics Domain Agent
       (PMDA) which exports "xtrace" events from a traced <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/bash.1.html">bash(1)</a>
       process.  This includes the command execution information that
       would usually be sent to standard error with the <b>set -x </b>option to
       the shell.

       Event metrics are exported showing each command executed, the
       function name and line number in the script, and a timestamp.
       Additionally, the process identifier for the shell and its parent
       process are exported.

       This requires <b>bash </b>version 4 or later.

       A brief description of the <b>pmdabash </b>command line options follows:

       <b>-d   </b>It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics <i>domain</i>
            number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is,
            <i>domain</i> should be different for every PMDA on the one host,
            and the same <i>domain</i> number should be used for the same PMDA
            on all hosts.

       <b>-l   </b>Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
            <i>bash.log</i> is written in the current directory of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> when
            <b>pmdabash </b>is started, i.e.  <b>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd</b>.  If the log
            file cannot be created or is not writable, output is written
            to the standard error instead.

       <b>-s   </b>Amount of time (in seconds) between subsequent evaluations
            of the shell trace file descriptor(s).  The default is 2
            seconds.

       <b>-m   </b>Maximum amount of memory to be allowed for each event queue
            (one per traced process).  The default is 2 megabytes.

       <b>-U   </b>User account under which to run the agent.  The default is
            the unprivileged "pcp" account in current versions of PCP,
            but in older versions the superuser account ("root") was
            used by default.
