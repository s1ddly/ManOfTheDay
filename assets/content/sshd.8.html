     <b>sshd </b>(OpenSSH Daemon) is the daemon program for ssh(1).  It
     provides secure encrypted communications between two untrusted
     hosts over an insecure network.

     <b>sshd </b>listens for connections from clients.  It is normally started
     at boot from <i>/etc/rc</i>.  It forks a new daemon for each incoming
     connection.  The forked daemons handle key exchange, encryption,
     authentication, command execution, and data exchange.

     <b>sshd </b>can be configured using command-line options or a
     configuration file (by default sshd_config(5)); command-line
     options override values specified in the configuration file.  <b>sshd</b>
     rereads its configuration file when it receives a hangup signal,
     SIGHUP, by executing itself with the name and options it was
     started with, e.g. <i>/usr/sbin/sshd</i>.

     The options are as follows:

     <b>-4      </b>Forces <b>sshd </b>to use IPv4 addresses only.

     <b>-6      </b>Forces <b>sshd </b>to use IPv6 addresses only.

     <b>-C </b><i>connection_spec</i>
             Specify the connection parameters to use for the <b>-T</b>
             extended test mode.  If provided, any <b>Match </b>directives in
             the configuration file that would apply are applied before
             the configuration is written to standard output.  The
             connection parameters are supplied as keyword=value pairs
             and may be supplied in any order, either with multiple <b>-C</b>
             options or as a comma-separated list.  The keywords are
             “addr”, “user”, “host”, “laddr”, “lport”, and “rdomain” and
             correspond to source address, user, resolved source host
             name, local address, local port number and routing domain
             respectively.

     <b>-c </b><i>host_certificate_file</i>
             Specifies a path to a certificate file to identify <b>sshd</b>
             during key exchange.  The certificate file must match a
             host key file specified using the <b>-h </b>option or the <b>HostKey</b>
             configuration directive.

     <b>-D      </b>When this option is specified, <b>sshd </b>will not detach and
             does not become a daemon.  This allows easy monitoring of
             <b>sshd</b>.

     <b>-d      </b>Debug mode.  The server sends verbose debug output to
             standard error, and does not put itself in the background.
             The server also will not fork(2) and will only process one
             connection.  This option is only intended for debugging for
             the server.  Multiple <b>-d </b>options increase the debugging
             level.  Maximum is 3.

     <b>-E </b><i>log_file</i>
             Append debug logs to <i>log_file</i> instead of the system log.

     <b>-e      </b>Write debug logs to standard error instead of the system
             log.

     <b>-f </b><i>config_file</i>
             Specifies the name of the configuration file.  The default
             is <i>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</i>.  <b>sshd </b>refuses to start if there is
             no configuration file.

     <b>-g </b><i>login_grace_time</i>
             Gives the grace time for clients to authenticate themselves
             (default 120 seconds).  If the client fails to authenticate
             the user within this many seconds, the server disconnects
             and exits.  A value of zero indicates no limit.

     <b>-h </b><i>host_key_file</i>
             Specifies a file from which a host key is read.  This
             option must be given if <b>sshd </b>is not run as root (as the
             normal host key files are normally not readable by anyone
             but root).  The default is <i>/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key</i>,
             <i>/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key</i> and
             <i>/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key</i>.  It is possible to have multiple
             host key files for the different host key algorithms.

     <b>-i      </b>Specifies that <b>sshd </b>is being run from inetd(8).

     <b>-o </b><i>option</i>
             Can be used to give options in the format used in the
             configuration file.  This is useful for specifying options
             for which there is no separate command-line flag.  For full
             details of the options, and their values, see
             sshd_config(5).

     <b>-p </b><i>port</i>
             Specifies the port on which the server listens for
             connections (default 22).  Multiple port options are
             permitted.  Ports specified in the configuration file with
             the <b>Port </b>option are ignored when a command-line port is
             specified.  Ports specified using the <b>ListenAddress </b>option
             override command-line ports.

     <b>-q      </b>Quiet mode.  Nothing is sent to the system log.  Normally
             the beginning, authentication, and termination of each
             connection is logged.

     <b>-T      </b>Extended test mode.  Check the validity of the
             configuration file, output the effective configuration to
             stdout and then exit.  Optionally, <b>Match </b>rules may be
             applied by specifying the connection parameters using one
             or more <b>-C </b>options.

     <b>-t      </b>Test mode.  Only check the validity of the configuration
             file and sanity of the keys.  This is useful for updating
             <b>sshd </b>reliably as configuration options may change.

     <b>-u </b><i>len</i>  This option is used to specify the size of the field in the
             utmp structure that holds the remote host name.  If the
             resolved host name is longer than <i>len</i>, the dotted decimal
             value will be used instead.  This allows hosts with very
             long host names that overflow this field to still be
             uniquely identified.  Specifying <b>-u0 </b>indicates that only
             dotted decimal addresses should be put into the <i>utmp</i> file.
             <b>-u0 </b>may also be used to prevent <b>sshd </b>from making DNS
             requests unless the authentication mechanism or
             configuration requires it.  Authentication mechanisms that
             may require DNS include <b>HostbasedAuthentication </b>and using a
             <b>from="pattern-list" </b>option in a key file.  Configuration
             options that require DNS include using a USER@HOST pattern
             in <b>AllowUsers </b>or <b>DenyUsers</b>.
