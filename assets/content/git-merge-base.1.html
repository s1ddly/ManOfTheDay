       <i>git merge-base</i> finds best common ancestor(s) between two commits
       to use in a three-way merge. One common ancestor is <i>better</i> than
       another common ancestor if the latter is an ancestor of the
       former. A common ancestor that does not have any better common
       ancestor is a <i>best common ancestor</i>, i.e. a <i>merge base</i>. Note that
       there can be more than one merge base for a pair of commits.
