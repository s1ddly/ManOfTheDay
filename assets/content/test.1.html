       Exit with the status determined by EXPRESSION.

       <b>--help </b>display this help and exit

       <b>--version</b>
              output version information and exit

       An omitted EXPRESSION defaults to false.  Otherwise, EXPRESSION
       is true or false and sets exit status.  It is one of:

       ( EXPRESSION )
              EXPRESSION is true

       ! EXPRESSION
              EXPRESSION is false

       EXPRESSION1 <b>-a </b>EXPRESSION2
              both EXPRESSION1 and EXPRESSION2 are true

       EXPRESSION1 <b>-o </b>EXPRESSION2
              either EXPRESSION1 or EXPRESSION2 is true

       <b>-n </b>STRING
              the length of STRING is nonzero

       STRING equivalent to <b>-n </b>STRING

       <b>-z </b>STRING
              the length of STRING is zero

       STRING1 = STRING2
              the strings are equal

       STRING1 != STRING2
              the strings are not equal

       INTEGER1 <b>-eq </b>INTEGER2
              INTEGER1 is equal to INTEGER2

       INTEGER1 <b>-ge </b>INTEGER2
              INTEGER1 is greater than or equal to INTEGER2

       INTEGER1 <b>-gt </b>INTEGER2
              INTEGER1 is greater than INTEGER2

       INTEGER1 <b>-le </b>INTEGER2
              INTEGER1 is less than or equal to INTEGER2

       INTEGER1 <b>-lt </b>INTEGER2
              INTEGER1 is less than INTEGER2

       INTEGER1 <b>-ne </b>INTEGER2
              INTEGER1 is not equal to INTEGER2

       FILE1 <b>-ef </b>FILE2
              FILE1 and FILE2 have the same device and inode numbers

       FILE1 <b>-nt </b>FILE2
              FILE1 is newer (modification date) than FILE2

       FILE1 <b>-ot </b>FILE2
              FILE1 is older than FILE2

       <b>-b </b>FILE
              FILE exists and is block special

       <b>-c </b>FILE
              FILE exists and is character special

       <b>-d </b>FILE
              FILE exists and is a directory

       <b>-e </b>FILE
              FILE exists

       <b>-f </b>FILE
              FILE exists and is a regular file

       <b>-g </b>FILE
              FILE exists and is set-group-ID

       <b>-G </b>FILE
              FILE exists and is owned by the effective group ID

       <b>-h </b>FILE
              FILE exists and is a symbolic link (same as <b>-L</b>)

       <b>-k </b>FILE
              FILE exists and has its sticky bit set

       <b>-L </b>FILE
              FILE exists and is a symbolic link (same as <b>-h</b>)

       <b>-N </b>FILE
              FILE exists and has been modified since it was last read

       <b>-O </b>FILE
              FILE exists and is owned by the effective user ID

       <b>-p </b>FILE
              FILE exists and is a named pipe

       <b>-r </b>FILE
              FILE exists and read permission is granted

       <b>-s </b>FILE
              FILE exists and has a size greater than zero

       <b>-S </b>FILE
              FILE exists and is a socket

       <b>-t </b>FD  file descriptor FD is opened on a terminal

       <b>-u </b>FILE
              FILE exists and its set-user-ID bit is set

       <b>-w </b>FILE
              FILE exists and write permission is granted

       <b>-x </b>FILE
              FILE exists and execute (or search) permission is granted

       Except for <b>-h </b>and <b>-L</b>, all FILE-related tests dereference symbolic
       links.  Beware that parentheses need to be escaped (e.g., by
       backslashes) for shells.  INTEGER may also be <b>-l </b>STRING, which
       evaluates to the length of STRING.

       NOTE: Binary <b>-a </b>and <b>-o </b>are inherently ambiguous.  Use 'test EXPR1
       &amp;&amp; test EXPR2' or 'test EXPR1 || test EXPR2' instead.

       NOTE: [ honors the <b>--help </b>and <b>--version </b>options, but test does
       not.  test treats each of those as it treats any other nonempty
       STRING.

       NOTE: your shell may have its own version of test and/or [, which
       usually supersedes the version described here.  Please refer to
       your shell's documentation for details about the options it
       supports.
