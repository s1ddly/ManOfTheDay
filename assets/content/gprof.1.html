       "gprof" produces an execution profile of C, Pascal, or Fortran77
       programs.  The effect of called routines is incorporated in the
       profile of each caller.  The profile data is taken from the call
       graph profile file (<i>gmon.out</i> default) which is created by
       programs that are compiled with the <b>-pg </b>option of "cc", "pc", and
       "f77".  The <b>-pg </b>option also links in versions of the library
       routines that are compiled for profiling.  "Gprof" reads the
       given object file (the default is "a.out") and establishes the
       relation between its symbol table and the call graph profile from
       <i>gmon.out</i>.  If more than one profile file is specified, the
       "gprof" output shows the sum of the profile information in the
       given profile files.

       "Gprof" calculates the amount of time spent in each routine.
       Next, these times are propagated along the edges of the call
       graph.  Cycles are discovered, and calls into a cycle are made to
       share the time of the cycle.

       Several forms of output are available from the analysis.

       The <i>flat profile</i> shows how much time your program spent in each
       function, and how many times that function was called.  If you
       simply want to know which functions burn most of the cycles, it
       is stated concisely here.

       The <i>call graph</i> shows, for each function, which functions called
       it, which other functions it called, and how many times.  There
       is also an estimate of how much time was spent in the subroutines
       of each function.  This can suggest places where you might try to
       eliminate function calls that use a lot of time.

       The <i>annotated source</i> listing is a copy of the program's source
       code, labeled with the number of times each line of the program
       was executed.
