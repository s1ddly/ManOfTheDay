       <b>nss-resolve </b>is a plug-in module for the GNU Name Service Switch
       (NSS) functionality of the GNU C Library (<b>glibc</b>) enabling it to
       resolve hostnames via the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/systemd-resolved.8.html">systemd-resolved(8)</a> local network name
       resolution service. It replaces the <b>nss-dns </b>plug-in module that
       traditionally resolves hostnames via DNS.

       To activate the NSS module, add "resolve [!UNAVAIL=return]" to
       the line starting with "hosts:" in /etc/nsswitch.conf.
       Specifically, it is recommended to place "resolve" early in
       /etc/nsswitch.conf's "hosts:" line. It should be before the
       "files" entry, since systemd-resolved supports /etc/hosts
       internally, but with caching. To the contrary, it should be after
       "mymachines", to give hostnames given to local VMs and containers
       precedence over names received over DNS. Finally, we recommend
       placing "dns" somewhere after "resolve", to fall back to <b>nss-dns</b>
       if systemd-resolved.service is not available.

       Note that <b>systemd-resolved </b>will synthesize DNS resource records
       in a few cases, for example for "localhost" and the current local
       hostname, see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/systemd-resolved.8.html">systemd-resolved(8)</a> for the full list. This
       duplicates the functionality of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/nss-myhostname.8.html">nss-myhostname(8)</a>, but it is
       still recommended (see examples below) to keep <b>nss-myhostname</b>
       configured in /etc/nsswitch.conf, to keep those names resolveable
       if <b>systemd-resolved </b>is not running.

       Please keep in mind that <b>nss-myhostname </b>(and <b>nss-resolve</b>) also
       resolve in the other direction â€” from locally attached IP
       addresses to hostnames. If you rely on that lookup being provided
       by DNS, you might want to order things differently.
