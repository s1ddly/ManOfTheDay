       <b>systemd-sysusers </b>creates system users and groups, based on the
       file format and location specified in <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/sysusers.d.5.html">sysusers.d(5)</a>.

       If invoked with no arguments, it applies all directives from all
       files found in the directories specified by <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/sysusers.d.5.html">sysusers.d(5)</a>. When
       invoked with positional arguments, if option <b>--replace=</b><i>PATH</i> is
       specified, arguments specified on the command line are used
       instead of the configuration file <i>PATH</i>. Otherwise, just the
       configuration specified by the command line arguments is
       executed. The string "-" may be specified instead of a filename
       to instruct <b>systemd-sysusers </b>to read the configuration from
       standard input. If only the basename of a file is specified, all
       configuration directories are searched for a matching file and
       the file found that has the highest priority is executed.
