       <b>systemd-cgtop </b>shows the top control groups of the local Linux
       control group hierarchy, ordered by their CPU, memory, or disk
       I/O load. The display is refreshed in regular intervals (by
       default every 1s), similar in style to <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/top.1.html">top(1)</a>. If a control group
       path is specified, shows only the services of the specified
       control group.

       If <b>systemd-cgtop </b>is not connected to a tty, no column headers are
       printed and the default is to only run one iteration. The
       <b>--iterations= </b>argument, if given, is honored. This mode is
       suitable for scripting.

       Resource usage is only accounted for control groups in the
       relevant hierarchy, i.e. CPU usage is only accounted for control
       groups in the "cpuacct" hierarchy, memory usage only for those in
       "memory" and disk I/O usage for those in "blkio". If resource
       monitoring for these resources is required, it is recommended to
       add the <i>CPUAccounting=1</i>, <i>MemoryAccounting=1</i> and
       <i>BlockIOAccounting=1</i> settings in the unit files in question. See
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/systemd.resource-control.5.html">systemd.resource-control(5)</a> for details.

       The CPU load value can be between 0 and 100 times the number of
       processors the system has. For example, if the system has 8
       processors, the CPU load value is going to be between 0% and
       800%. The number of processors can be found in "/proc/cpuinfo".

       To emphasize this: unless "CPUAccounting=1", "MemoryAccounting=1"
       and "BlockIOAccounting=1" are enabled for the services in
       question, no resource accounting will be available for system
       services and the data shown by <b>systemd-cgtop </b>will be incomplete.
