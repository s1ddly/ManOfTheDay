       You can analyze various lock behaviours and statistics with this
       <i>perf lock</i> command.

           'perf lock record &lt;command&gt;' records lock events
           between start and end &lt;command&gt;. And this command
           produces the file "perf.data" which contains tracing
           results of lock events.

           'perf lock report' reports statistical data.

           'perf lock script' shows raw lock events.

           'perf lock info' shows metadata like threads or addresses
           of lock instances.
