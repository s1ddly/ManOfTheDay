       Removes an entry for the object with id ID to the permission
       store table TABLE. The ID must be in a suitable format for the
       table. If APP_ID is specified, only the entry for that
       application is removed.

       The permission store is used by portals. Each portal generally
       has its own table in the permission store, and the format of the
       table entries is specific to each portal.
