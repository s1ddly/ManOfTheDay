       The <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/nfsref.8.html">nfsref(8)</a> command is a simple way to get started managing
       junction metadata.  Other administrative commands provide richer
       access to junction information.

   <b>Subcommands</b>
       Valid <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/nfsref.8.html">nfsref(8)</a> subcommands are:

       <b>add    </b>Adds junction information to the directory named by
              <i>pathname</i>.  The named directory must already exist, and
              must not already contain junction information.  Regular
              directory contents are obscured to NFS clients by this
              operation.

              A list of one or more file server and export path pairs is
              also specified on the command line.  When creating an NFS
              basic junction, this list is stored in an extended
              attribute of the directory.

              If junction creation is successful, the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/nfsref.8.html">nfsref(8)</a> command
              flushes the kernel's export cache to remove previously
              cached junction information.

       <b>remove </b>Removes junction information from the directory named by
              <i>pathname</i>.  The named directory must exist, and must
              contain junction information.  Regular directory contents
              are made visible to NFS clients again by this operation.

              If junction deletion is successful, the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/nfsref.8.html">nfsref(8)</a> command
              flushes the kernel's export cache to remove previously
              cached junction information.

       <b>lookup </b>Displays junction information stored in the directory
              named by <i>pathname</i>.  The named directory must exist, and
              must contain junction information.

              When looking up an NFS basic junction, the junction
              information in the directory is listed on <i>stdout</i>.

   <b>Command line options</b>
       <b>-d, --debug</b>
              Enables debugging messages during operation.

       <b>-t, --type=</b><i>junction-type</i>
              Specifies the junction type for the operation.  Valid
              values for <i>junction-type</i> are <b>nfs-basic </b>or <b>nfs-fedfs</b>.

              For the <b>add </b>subcommand, the default value if this option
              is not specified is <b>nfs-basic</b>.  For the <b>remove </b>and <b>lookup</b>
              subcommands, the <b>--type </b>option is not required.  The
              <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/nfsref.8.html">nfsref(8)</a> command operates on whatever junction contents
              are available.
