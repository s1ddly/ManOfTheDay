       This shell script is used to integrate the Performance Co-Pilot
       (see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/PCPIntro.1.html">PCPIntro(1)</a>) collector service discovery mechanisms with
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmie.1.html">pmie(1)</a> and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> service administration, such that
       multiple collector hosts can be monitored from a single
       centralized host.  It is important to note that the <b>pmfind</b>
       service is tightly integrated with the <b>pmie </b>and <b>pmlogger</b>
       services, and these must also be enabled if the services are to
       be started for each collector system that <b>pmfind </b>discovers.

       <b>pmfind_check </b>is designed to be enabled via a service management
       daemon such as <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/systemd.1.html">systemd(1)</a> on Linux.  It is run from a system
       timer (either by <b>systemd </b>or by <b>cron </b>on other systems).  Once per
       timer interval <b>pmfind </b>attempts discovery of PCP collector
       systems.  For each unique system found <b>pmfind_check </b>creates
       <b>pmie_check </b>and <b>pmlogger_check </b>control file entries, such that
       these latter process can manage one <b>pmie </b>and <b>pmlogger </b>service for
       each discovered collector system.

       When run through <b>systemd </b>these processes will be launched
       immediately because <b>systemd </b>monitors the service control files
       for changes.  With <b>systemd </b>one may also initiate an immediate
       service discovery with <b>pmfind </b>and <b>pmfind_check </b>by modifying the
       <i>$PCP_SYSCONF_DIR/pmfind</i> directory in any way.

       When run from <b>cron </b>the next (also timer-based) invocation of
       <b>pmie_check </b>or <b>pmlogger_check </b>will start and manage the associated
       <b>pmie </b>and <b>pmlogger </b>processes.

       The control file entries created by <b>pmfind_check </b>follow the
       convention of individual files for each collector host.  The
       files are named using the (unique) source identifier that <b>pmfind</b>
       calculates.  This identifier is a hash calculated based on (non-
       optional) context labels available from every collector host, and
       is the same source identifier reported and used by <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pminfo.1.html">pminfo(1)</a> and
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmseries.1.html">pmseries(1)</a>.
