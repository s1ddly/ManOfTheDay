       <b>ranlib </b>generates an index to the contents of an archive and
       stores it in the archive.  The index lists each symbol defined by
       a member of an archive that is a relocatable object file.

       You may use <b>nm -s </b>or <b>nm --print-armap </b>to list this index.

       An archive with such an index speeds up linking to the library
       and allows routines in the library to call each other without
       regard to their placement in the archive.

       The GNU <b>ranlib </b>program is another form of GNU <b>ar</b>; running <b>ranlib</b>
       is completely equivalent to executing <b>ar -s</b>.
