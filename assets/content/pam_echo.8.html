       The <i>pam_echo</i> PAM module is for printing text messages to inform
       user about special things. Sequences starting with the <i>%</i>
       character are interpreted in the following way:

       <i>%H</i>
           The name of the remote host (PAM_RHOST).

       <i>%h</i>
           The name of the local host.

       <i>%s</i>
           The service name (PAM_SERVICE).

       <i>%t</i>
           The name of the controlling terminal (PAM_TTY).

       <i>%U</i>
           The remote user name (PAM_RUSER).

       <i>%u</i>
           The local user name (PAM_USER).

       All other sequences beginning with <i>%</i> expands to the characters
       following the <i>%</i> character.
