<pre>
       Makes a particular branch of an application current. Only the
       current branch of an app has its exported files (such as desktop
       files and icons) made visible to the host.

       When a new branch is installed it will automatically be made
       current, so this command is often not needed.

       Unless overridden with the <b>--user </b>or <b>--installation </b>options, this
       command changes the default system-wide installation.
