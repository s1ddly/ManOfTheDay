       <b>pmdasockets </b>is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
       exports metric values for current sockets on the local system.

       This PMDA currently collects its data through the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ss.8.html">ss(8)</a> utility
       and requires that the program is installed in order to function.
       This dependency may change in the future.
