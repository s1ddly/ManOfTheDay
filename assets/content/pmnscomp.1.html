       <b>pmnscomp </b>compiles a Performance Metrics Name Space (PMNS) in
       ASCII format into a more efficient binary representation.
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/pmLoadNameSpace.3.html">pmLoadNameSpace(3)</a> is able to load this binary representation
       significantly faster than the equivalent ASCII representation.

       If <i>outfile</i> already exists <b>pmnscomp </b>will exit without overwriting
       it.

       By convention, the name of the compiled namespace is that of the
       root file of the ASCII namespace, with <b>.bin </b>appended.  For
       example, the root of the default PMNS is a file named <b>root </b>and
       the compiled version of the entire namespace is <b>root.bin</b>.

       The options are;

       <b>-d   </b>By default the PMNS to be compiled is expected to contain at
            most one name for each unique Performance Metric Identifier
            (PMID).  The <b>-d </b>option relaxes this restriction and allows
            the compilation of a PMNS in which multiple names may be
            associated with a single PMID.  Duplicate names are useful
            when a particular metric may be logically associated with
            more than one group of related metrics, or when it is
            desired to create abbreviated aliases to name a set of
            frequently used metrics.

       <b>-f   </b>Force overwriting of an existing <i>outfile</i> if it already
            exists.

       <b>-n   </b>Normally <b>pmnscomp </b>operates on the default PMNS, however if
            the <b>-n </b>option is specified an alternative namespace is
            loaded from the file <i>namespace.</i>

       <b>-v   </b>By default, <b>pmnscomp </b>writes a version <b>2 </b>compiled namespace.
            If <i>version</i> is <b>1 </b>then <b>pmnscomp </b>will write a version <b>1</b>
            namespace which is similar to version <b>2</b>, without the extra
            integrity afforded by checksums.  Note that PCP version 2.0
            or later can handle both versions <b>1 </b>and <b>2 </b>of the binary PMNS
            format.

       The default input PMNS is found in the file
       <i>$PCP_VAR_DIR/pmns/root</i> unless the environment variable
       <b>PMNS_DEFAULT </b>is set, in which case the value is assumed to be the
       pathname to the file containing the default input PMNS.
