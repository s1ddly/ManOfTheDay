       Network interfaces names and MAC addresses may be generated based
       on certain stable interface attributes. This is possible when
       there is enough information about the device to generate those
       attributes and the use of this information is configured. This
       page describes interface naming, i.e. what possible names may be
       generated. Those names are generated by the
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/systemd-udevd.service.8.html">systemd-udevd.service(8)</a> builtin <b>net_id </b>and exported as udev
       properties (<i>ID_NET_NAME_ONBOARD=</i>, <i>ID_NET_LABEL_ONBOARD=</i>,
       <i>ID_NET_NAME_PATH=</i>, <i>ID_NET_NAME_SLOT=</i>).

       Names and MAC addresses are derived from various stable device
       metadata attributes. Newer versions of udev take more of these
       attributes into account, improving (and thus possibly changing)
       the names and addresses used for the same devices. Different
       versions of those generation rules are called "naming schemes".
       The default naming scheme is chosen at compilation time. Usually
       this will be the latest implemented version, but it is also
       possible to set one of the older versions to preserve
       compatibility. This may be useful for example for distributions,
       which may introduce new versions of systemd in stable releases
       without changing the naming scheme. The naming scheme may also be
       overridden using the <i>net.naming-scheme=</i> kernel command line
       switch, see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/systemd-udevd.service.8.html">systemd-udevd.service(8)</a>. Available naming schemes
       are described below.

       After the udev properties have been generated, appropriate udev
       rules may be used to actually rename devices based on those
       properties. See the description of <i>NamePolicy=</i> and
       <i>MACAddressPolicy=</i> in <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/systemd.link.5.html">systemd.link(5)</a>.

       Note that while the concept of network interface naming schemes
       is primarily relevant in the context of systemd-udevd.service,
       the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/systemd-nspawn.1.html">systemd-nspawn(1)</a> container manager also takes it into
       account when naming network interfaces, see below.
