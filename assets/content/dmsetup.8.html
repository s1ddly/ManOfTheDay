       dmsetup manages logical devices that use the device-mapper
       driver.  Devices are created by loading a table that specifies a
       target for each sector (512 bytes) in the logical device.

       The first argument to dmsetup is a command.  The second argument
       is the logical device name or uuid.

       Invoking the dmsetup tool as <b>devmap_name </b>(which is not normally
       distributed and is supported only for historical reasons) is
       equivalent to <b>dmsetup info -c --noheadings -j </b><i>major</i> <b>-m </b><i>minor</i>.
