       Initially, the MySQL C API was developed to be very similar to
       that for the mSQL database system. Because of this, mSQL programs
       often can be converted relatively easily for use with MySQL by
       changing the names of the C API functions.

       The <b>msql2mysql </b>utility performs the conversion of mSQL C API
       function calls to their MySQL equivalents.  <b>msql2mysql </b>converts
       the input file in place, so make a copy of the original before
       converting it. For example, use <b>msql2mysql </b>like this:

           shell&gt; <b>cp client-prog.c client-prog.c.orig</b>
           shell&gt; <b>msql2mysql client-prog.c</b>
           client-prog.c converted

       Then examine client-prog.c and make any post-conversion revisions
       that may be necessary.

       <b>msql2mysql </b>uses the <b>replace </b>utility to make the function name
       substitutions. See <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/replace.1.html">replace(1)</a>.
