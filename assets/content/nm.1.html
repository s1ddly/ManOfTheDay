       GNU <b>nm </b>lists the symbols from object files <i>objfile</i>....  If no
       object files are listed as arguments, <b>nm </b>assumes the file <i>a.out</i>.

       For each symbol, <b>nm </b>shows:

       •   The symbol value, in the radix selected by options (see
           below), or hexadecimal by default.

       •   The symbol type.  At least the following types are used;
           others are, as well, depending on the object file format.  If
           lowercase, the symbol is usually local; if uppercase, the
           symbol is global (external).  There are however a few
           lowercase symbols that are shown for special global symbols
           ("u", "v" and "w").

           "A" The symbol's value is absolute, and will not be changed
               by further linking.

           "B"
           "b" The symbol is in the BSS data section.  This section
               typically contains zero-initialized or uninitialized
               data, although the exact behavior is system dependent.

           "C"
           "c" The symbol is common.  Common symbols are uninitialized
               data.  When linking, multiple common symbols may appear
               with the same name.  If the symbol is defined anywhere,
               the common symbols are treated as undefined references.
               The lower case <i>c</i> character is used when the symbol is in
               a special section for small commons.

           "D"
           "d" The symbol is in the initialized data section.

           "G"
           "g" The symbol is in an initialized data section for small
               objects.  Some object file formats permit more efficient
               access to small data objects, such as a global int
               variable as opposed to a large global array.

           "i" For PE format files this indicates that the symbol is in
               a section specific to the implementation of DLLs.

               For ELF format files this indicates that the symbol is an
               indirect function.  This is a GNU extension to the
               standard set of ELF symbol types.  It indicates a symbol
               which if referenced by a relocation does not evaluate to
               its address, but instead must be invoked at runtime.  The
               runtime execution will then return the value to be used
               in the relocation.

               Note - the actual symbols display for GNU indirect
               symbols is controlled by the <b>--ifunc-chars </b>command line
               option.  If this option has been provided then the first
               character in the string will be used for global indirect
               function symbols.  If the string contains a second
               character then that will be used for local indirect
               function symbols.

           "I" The symbol is an indirect reference to another symbol.

           "N" The symbol is a debugging symbol.

           "n" The symbol is in the read-only data section.

           "p" The symbol is in a stack unwind section.

           "R"
           "r" The symbol is in a read only data section.

           "S"
           "s" The symbol is in an uninitialized or zero-initialized
               data section for small objects.

           "T"
           "t" The symbol is in the text (code) section.

           "U" The symbol is undefined.

           "u" The symbol is a unique global symbol.  This is a GNU
               extension to the standard set of ELF symbol bindings.
               For such a symbol the dynamic linker will make sure that
               in the entire process there is just one symbol with this
               name and type in use.

           "V"
           "v" The symbol is a weak object.  When a weak defined symbol
               is linked with a normal defined symbol, the normal
               defined symbol is used with no error.  When a weak
               undefined symbol is linked and the symbol is not defined,
               the value of the weak symbol becomes zero with no error.
               On some systems, uppercase indicates that a default value
               has been specified.

           "W"
           "w" The symbol is a weak symbol that has not been
               specifically tagged as a weak object symbol.  When a weak
               defined symbol is linked with a normal defined symbol,
               the normal defined symbol is used with no error.  When a
               weak undefined symbol is linked and the symbol is not
               defined, the value of the symbol is determined in a
               system-specific manner without error.  On some systems,
               uppercase indicates that a default value has been
               specified.

           "-" The symbol is a stabs symbol in an a.out object file.  In
               this case, the next values printed are the stabs other
               field, the stabs desc field, and the stab type.  Stabs
               symbols are used to hold debugging information.

           "?" The symbol type is unknown, or object file format
               specific.

       •   The symbol name.  If a symbol has version information
           associated with it, then the version information is displayed
           as well.  If the versioned symbol is undefined or hidden from
           linker, the version string is displayed as a suffix to the
           symbol name, preceded by an @ character.  For example
           <b>foo@VER_1</b>.  If the version is the default version to be used
           when resolving unversioned references to the symbol, then it
           is displayed as a suffix preceded by two @ characters.  For
           example <b>foo@@VER_2</b>.
