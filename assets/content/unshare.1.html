       The <b>unshare </b>command creates new namespaces (as specified by the
       command-line options described below) and then executes the
       specified <i>program</i>. If <i>program</i> is not given, then "${SHELL}" is
       run (default: <i>/bin/sh</i>).

       By default, a new namespace persists only as long as it has
       member processes. A new namespace can be made persistent even
       when it has no member processes by bind mounting
       /proc/<i>pid</i>/ns/<i>type</i> files to a filesystem path. A namespace that
       has been made persistent in this way can subsequently be entered
       with <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/nsenter.1.html">nsenter(1)</a> even after the <i>program</i> terminates (except PID
       namespaces where a permanently running init process is required).
       Once a persistent namespace is no longer needed, it can be
       unpersisted by using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/umount.8.html">umount(8)</a> to remove the bind mount. See the
       EXAMPLES section for more details.

       <b>unshare </b>since util-linux version 2.36 uses
       <i>/proc/[pid]/ns/pid_for_children</i> and
       <i>/proc/[pid]/ns/time_for_children</i> files for persistent PID and
       TIME namespaces. This change requires Linux kernel 4.17 or newer.

       The following types of namespaces can be created with <b>unshare</b>:

       <b>mount namespace</b>
           Mounting and unmounting filesystems will not affect the rest
           of the system, except for filesystems which are explicitly
           marked as shared (with <b>mount --make-shared</b>; see
           <i>/proc/self/mountinfo</i> or <b>findmnt -o+PROPAGATION </b>for the <b>shared</b>
           flags). For further details, see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/mount_namespaces.7.html">mount_namespaces(7)</a>.

           <b>unshare </b>since util-linux version 2.27 automatically sets
           propagation to <b>private </b>in a new mount namespace to make sure
           that the new namespace is really unshared. Itâ€™s possible to
           disable this feature with option <b>--propagation unchanged</b>.
           Note that <b>private </b>is the kernel default.

       <b>UTS namespace</b>
           Setting hostname or domainname will not affect the rest of
           the system. For further details, see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/uts_namespaces.7.html">uts_namespaces(7)</a>.

       <b>IPC namespace</b>
           The process will have an independent namespace for POSIX
           message queues as well as System V message queues, semaphore
           sets and shared memory segments. For further details, see
           <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/ipc_namespaces.7.html">ipc_namespaces(7)</a>.

       <b>network namespace</b>
           The process will have independent IPv4 and IPv6 stacks, IP
           routing tables, firewall rules, the <i>/proc/net</i> and
           <i>/sys/class/net</i> directory trees, sockets, etc. For further
           details, see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/network_namespaces.7.html">network_namespaces(7)</a>.

       <b>PID namespace</b>
           Children will have a distinct set of PID-to-process mappings
           from their parent. For further details, see
           <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/pid_namespaces.7.html">pid_namespaces(7)</a>.

       <b>cgroup namespace</b>
           The process will have a virtualized view of
           <i>/proc/self/cgroup</i>, and new cgroup mounts will be rooted at
           the namespace cgroup root. For further details, see
           <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/cgroup_namespaces.7.html">cgroup_namespaces(7)</a>.

       <b>user namespace</b>
           The process will have a distinct set of UIDs, GIDs and
           capabilities. For further details, see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/user_namespaces.7.html">user_namespaces(7)</a>.

       <b>time namespace</b>
           The process can have a distinct view of <b>CLOCK_MONOTONIC</b>
           and/or <b>CLOCK_BOOTTIME </b>which can be changed using
           <i>/proc/self/timens_offsets</i>. For further details, see
           <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/time_namespaces.7.html">time_namespaces(7)</a>.
