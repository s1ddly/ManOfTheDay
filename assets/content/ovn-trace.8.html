       This utility simulates packet forwarding within an OVN logical
       network. It can be used to run through ``what-if’’ scenarios: if
       a packet originates at a logical port, what will happen to it and
       where will it ultimately end up? Users already familiar with the
       Open vSwitch <b>ofproto/trace </b>command described in <b>ovs-vswitch</b>(8)
       will find <b>ovn-trace </b>to be a similar tool for logical networks.

       <b>ovn-trace </b>works by reading the <b>Logical_Flow </b>and other tables from
       the OVN southbound database (see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/ovn-sb.5.html">ovn-sb(5)</a>). It simulates a
       packet’s path through logical networks by repeatedly looking it
       up in the logical flow table, following the entire tree of
       possibilities.

       <b>ovn-trace </b>simulates only the OVN logical network. It does not
       simulate the physical elements on which the logical network is
       layered. This means that, for example, it is unimportant how VMs
       are distributed among hypervisors, or whether their hypervisors
       are functioning and reachable, so <b>ovn-trace </b>will yield the same
       results regardless. There is one important exception: <b>ovn-northd</b>,
       the daemon that generates the logical flows that <b>ovn-trace</b>
       simulates, treats logical ports differently based on whether they
       are up or down. Thus, if you see surprising results, ensure that
       the ports involved in a simulation are up.

       The simplest way to use <b>ovn-trace </b>is to provide <i>datapath</i> and
       <i>microflow</i> arguments on the command line. In this case, it
       simulates the behavior of a single packet and exits. For an
       alternate usage model, see <b>Daemon Mode </b>below.

       The <i>datapath</i> argument specifies the name of a logical datapath.
       Acceptable names are the <b>name </b>from the northbound <b>Logical_Switch</b>
       or <b>Logical_Router </b>table, the UUID of a record from one of those
       tables, or the UUID of a record from the southbound
       <b>Datapath_Binding </b>table.

       The <i>microflow</i> argument describes the packet whose forwarding is
       to be simulated, in the syntax of an OVN logical expression, as
       described in <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/ovn-sb.5.html">ovn-sb(5)</a>, to express constraints. The parser
       understands prerequisites; for example, if the expression refers
       to <b>ip4.src</b>, there is no need to explicitly state <b>ip4 </b>or <b>eth.type</b>
       <b>== 0x800</b>.

       For reasonable L2 behavior, the microflow should include at least
       <b>inport </b>and <b>eth.dst</b>, plus <b>eth.src </b>if port security is enabled. For
       example:

           <b>inport == "lp11" &amp;&amp; eth.src == 00:01:02:03:04:05 &amp;&amp; eth.dst == ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff</b>

       For reasonable L3 behavior, <i>microflow</i> should also include <b>ip4.src</b>
       and <b>ip4.dst </b>(or <b>ip6.src </b>and <b>ip6.dst</b>) and <b>ip.ttl</b>. For example:

           <b>inport == "lp111" &amp;&amp; eth.src == f0:00:00:00:01:11 &amp;&amp; eth.dst == 00:00:00:00:ff:11</b>
           <b>&amp;&amp; ip4.src == 192.168.11.1 &amp;&amp; ip4.dst == 192.168.22.2 &amp;&amp; ip.ttl == 64</b>

       Here’s an ARP microflow example:

           <b>inport == "lp123"</b>
           <b>&amp;&amp; eth.dst == ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff &amp;&amp; eth.src == f0:00:00:00:01:11</b>
           <b>&amp;&amp; arp.op == 1 &amp;&amp; arp.sha == f0:00:00:00:01:11 &amp;&amp; arp.spa == 192.168.1.11</b>
           <b>&amp;&amp; arp.tha == ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff &amp;&amp; arp.tpa == 192.168.2.22</b>

       <b>ovn-trace </b>will reject erroneous microflow expressions, which
       beyond syntax errors fall into two categories. First, they can be
       ambiguous. For example, <b>tcp.src == 80 </b>is ambiguous because it
       does not state IPv4 or IPv6 as the Ethernet type. <b>ip4 &amp;&amp; tcp.src</b>
       <b>&gt; 1024 </b>is also ambiguous because it does not constrain bits of
       <b>tcp.src </b>to particular values. Second, they can be contradictory,
       e.g. <b>ip4 &amp;&amp; ip6</b>.
