<pre>
       Create a new commit containing the current contents of the index
       and the given log message describing the changes. The new commit
       is a direct child of HEAD, usually the tip of the current branch,
       and the branch is updated to point to it (unless no branch is
       associated with the working tree, in which case HEAD is
       "detached" as described in <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/git-checkout.1.html">git-checkout(1)</a>).

       The content to be committed can be specified in several ways:

        1. by using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/git-add.1.html">git-add(1)</a> to incrementally "add" changes to the
           index before using the <i>commit</i> command (Note: even modified
           files must be "added");

        2. by using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/git-rm.1.html">git-rm(1)</a> to remove files from the working tree and
           the index, again before using the <i>commit</i> command;

        3. by listing files as arguments to the <i>commit</i> command (without
           --interactive or --patch switch), in which case the commit
           will ignore changes staged in the index, and instead record
           the current content of the listed files (which must already
           be known to Git);

        4. by using the -a switch with the <i>commit</i> command to
           automatically "add" changes from all known files (i.e. all
           files that are already listed in the index) and to
           automatically "rm" files in the index that have been removed
           from the working tree, and then perform the actual commit;

        5. by using the --interactive or --patch switches with the
           <i>commit</i> command to decide one by one which files or hunks
           should be part of the commit in addition to contents in the
           index, before finalizing the operation. See the “Interactive
           Mode” section of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/git-add.1.html">git-add(1)</a> to learn how to operate these
           modes.

       The <b>--dry-run </b>option can be used to obtain a summary of what is
       included by any of the above for the next commit by giving the
       same set of parameters (options and paths).

       If you make a commit and then find a mistake immediately after
       that, you can recover from it with <i>git reset</i>.
