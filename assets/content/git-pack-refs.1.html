       Traditionally, tips of branches and tags (collectively known as
       <i>refs</i>) were stored one file per ref in a (sub)directory under
       <b>$GIT_DIR/refs </b>directory. While many branch tips tend to be
       updated often, most tags and some branch tips are never updated.
       When a repository has hundreds or thousands of tags, this
       one-file-per-ref format both wastes storage and hurts
       performance.

       This command is used to solve the storage and performance problem
       by storing the refs in a single file, <b>$GIT_DIR/packed-refs</b>. When
       a ref is missing from the traditional <b>$GIT_DIR/refs </b>directory
       hierarchy, it is looked up in this file and used if found.

       Subsequent updates to branches always create new files under
       <b>$GIT_DIR/refs </b>directory hierarchy.

       A recommended practice to deal with a repository with too many
       refs is to pack its refs with <b>--all </b>once, and occasionally run
       <b>git pack-refs</b>. Tags are by definition stationary and are not
       expected to change. Branch heads will be packed with the initial
       <b>pack-refs --all</b>, but only the currently active branch heads will
       become unpacked, and the next <b>pack-refs </b>(without <b>--all</b>) will
       leave them unpacked.
