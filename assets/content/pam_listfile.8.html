       pam_listfile is a PAM module which provides a way to deny or
       allow services based on an arbitrary file.

       The module gets the <b>item </b>of the type specified -- <i>user</i> specifies
       the username, <i>PAM_USER</i>; tty specifies the name of the terminal
       over which the request has been made, <i>PAM_TTY</i>; rhost specifies
       the name of the remote host (if any) from which the request was
       made, <i>PAM_RHOST</i>; and ruser specifies the name of the remote user
       (if available) who made the request, <i>PAM_RUSER</i> -- and looks for
       an instance of that item in the <b>file=</b><i>filename</i>.  filename contains
       one line per item listed. If the item is found, then if
       <b>sense=</b><i>allow</i>, <i>PAM_SUCCESS</i> is returned, causing the authorization
       request to succeed; else if <b>sense=</b><i>deny</i>, <i>PAM_AUTH_ERR</i> is returned,
       causing the authorization request to fail.

       If an error is encountered (for instance, if filename does not
       exist, or a poorly-constructed argument is encountered), then if
       <i>onerr=succeed</i>, <i>PAM_SUCCESS</i> is returned, otherwise if <i>onerr=fail</i>,
       <i>PAM_AUTH_ERR</i> or <i>PAM_SERVICE_ERR</i> (as appropriate) will be
       returned.

       An additional argument, <b>apply=</b>, can be used to restrict the
       application of the above to a specific user (<b>apply=</b><i>username</i>) or a
       given group (<b>apply=</b><i>@groupname</i>). This added restriction is only
       meaningful when used with the <i>tty</i>, <i>rhost</i> and <i>shell</i> items.

       Besides this last one, all arguments should be specified; do not
       count on any default behavior.

       No credentials are awarded by this module.
