       Read a tar archive created by <i>git archive</i> from the standard input
       and extract the commit ID stored in it. It reads only the first
       1024 bytes of input, thus its runtime is not influenced by the
       size of the tar archive very much.

       If no commit ID is found, <i>git get-tar-commit-id</i> quietly exists
       with a return code of 1. This can happen if the archive had not
       been created using <i>git archive</i> or if the first parameter of <i>git</i>
       <i>archive</i> had been a tree ID instead of a commit ID or tag.
