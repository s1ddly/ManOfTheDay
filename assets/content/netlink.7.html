       Netlink is used to transfer information between the kernel and
       user-space processes.  It consists of a standard sockets-based
       interface for user space processes and an internal kernel API for
       kernel modules.  The internal kernel interface is not documented
       in this manual page.  There is also an obsolete netlink interface
       via netlink character devices; this interface is not documented
       here and is provided only for backward compatibility.

       Netlink is a datagram-oriented service.  Both <b>SOCK_RAW </b>and
       <b>SOCK_DGRAM </b>are valid values for <i>socket_type</i>.  However, the
       netlink protocol does not distinguish between datagram and raw
       sockets.

       <i>netlink_family</i> selects the kernel module or netlink group to
       communicate with.  The currently assigned netlink families are:

       <b>NETLINK_ROUTE</b>
              Receives routing and link updates and may be used to
              modify the routing tables (both IPv4 and IPv6), IP
              addresses, link parameters, neighbor setups, queueing
              disciplines, traffic classes, and packet classifiers (see
              <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/rtnetlink.7.html">rtnetlink(7)</a>).

       <b>NETLINK_W1 </b>(Linux 2.6.13 to 2.16.17)

              declared obsolete (in favor of the more advanced
              <i>nfnetlink_queue</i> feature), <b>NETLINK_FIREWALL </b>was removed in

       <b>NETLINK_INET_DIAG </b>(since Linux 2.6.14)
              An obsolete synonym for <b>NETLINK_SOCK_DIAG</b>.

              Access to FIB lookup from user space.

       <b>NETLINK_CONNECTOR </b>(since Linux 2.6.14)
              Kernel connector.  See
              <i>Documentation/driver-api/connector.rst</i> (or
              <i>/Documentation/connector/connector.*</i>  in kernel 5.2 and
              earlier) in the Linux kernel source tree for further
              information.

              Transport IPv6 packets from netfilter to user space.  Used
              by <i>ip6_queue</i> kernel module.

       <b>NETLINK_DNRTMSG</b>
              DECnet routing messages.

       <b>NETLINK_KOBJECT_UEVENT </b>(since Linux 2.6.10)
              Kernel messages to user space.

       <b>NETLINK_GENERIC </b>(since Linux 2.6.15)
              Generic netlink family for simplified netlink usage.

       <b>NETLINK_CRYPTO </b>(since Linux 3.2)
              Netlink interface to request information about ciphers
              registered with the kernel crypto API as well as allow
              configuration of the kernel crypto API.

       Netlink messages consist of a byte stream with one or multiple
       <i>nlmsghdr</i> headers and associated payload.  The byte stream should
       be accessed only with the standard <b>NLMSG_* </b>macros.  See
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/netlink.3.html">netlink(3)</a> for further information.

       In multipart messages (multiple <i>nlmsghdr</i> headers with associated
       payload in one byte stream) the first and all following headers
       have the <b>NLM_F_MULTI </b>flag set, except for the last header which
       has the type <b>NLMSG_DONE</b>.

       After each <i>nlmsghdr</i> the payload follows.

           struct nlmsghdr {
               __u32 nlmsg_len;    /* Length of message including header */
               __u16 nlmsg_type;   /* Type of message content */
               __u16 nlmsg_flags;  /* Additional flags */
               __u32 nlmsg_seq;    /* Sequence number */
               __u32 nlmsg_pid;    /* Sender port ID */
           };

       <i>nlmsg_type</i> can be one of the standard message types: <b>NLMSG_NOOP</b>
       message is to be ignored, <b>NLMSG_ERROR </b>message signals an error
       and the payload contains an <i>nlmsgerr</i> structure, <b>NLMSG_DONE</b>
       message terminates a multipart message.  Error messages get the
       original request appened, unless the user requests to cap the
       error message, and get extra error data if requested.

           struct nlmsgerr {
               int error;        /* Negative errno or 0 for acknowledgements */
               struct nlmsghdr msg;  /* Message header that caused the error */
               /*
                * followed by the message contents unless NETLINK_CAP_ACK was set
                * or the ACK indicates success (error == 0).
                * For example Generic Netlink message with attributes.
                * message length is aligned with NLMSG_ALIGN()
                */
               /*
                * followed by TLVs defined in enum nlmsgerr_attrs
                * if NETLINK_EXT_ACK was set
                */
           };

       A netlink family usually specifies more message types, see the
       appropriate manual pages for that, for example, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/rtnetlink.7.html">rtnetlink(7)</a> for
       <b>NETLINK_ROUTE</b>.

       Standard flag bits in <i>nlmsg_flags</i>
       ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       <b>NLM_F_REQUEST           </b>Must be set on all request messages.
       <b>NLM_F_MULTI             </b>The message is part of a multipart
                               message terminated by <b>NLMSG_DONE</b>.
       <b>NLM_F_ACK               </b>Request for an acknowledgement on
                               success.
       <b>NLM_F_ECHO              </b>Echo this request.

       Additional flag bits for GET requests
       ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       <b>NLM_F_ROOT               </b>Return the complete table instead of a
                                single entry.
       <b>NLM_F_MATCH              </b>Return all entries matching criteria
                                passed in message content.  Not
                                implemented yet.
       <b>NLM_F_ATOMIC             </b>Return an atomic snapshot of the table.
       <b>NLM_F_DUMP               </b>Convenience macro; equivalent to
                                (NLM_F_ROOT|NLM_F_MATCH).

       Note that <b>NLM_F_ATOMIC </b>requires the <b>CAP_NET_ADMIN </b>capability or
       an effective UID of 0.

       Additional flag bits for NEW requests
       ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       <b>NLM_F_REPLACE             </b>Replace existing matching object.
       <b>NLM_F_EXCL                </b>Don't replace if the object already
                                 exists.
       <b>NLM_F_CREATE              </b>Create object if it doesn't already
                                 exist.
       <b>NLM_F_APPEND              </b>Add to the end of the object list.

       <i>nlmsg_seq</i> and <i>nlmsg_pid</i> are used to track messages.  <i>nlmsg_pid</i>
       shows the origin of the message.  Note that there isn't a 1:1
       relationship between <i>nlmsg_pid</i> and the PID of the process if the
       message originated from a netlink socket.  See the <b>ADDRESS</b>
       <b>FORMATS </b>section for further information.

       Both <i>nlmsg_seq</i> and <i>nlmsg_pid</i> are opaque to netlink core.

       Netlink is not a reliable protocol.  It tries its best to deliver
       a message to its destination(s), but may drop messages when an
       out-of-memory condition or other error occurs.  For reliable
       transfer the sender can request an acknowledgement from the
       receiver by setting the <b>NLM_F_ACK </b>flag.  An acknowledgement is an
       <b>NLMSG_ERROR </b>packet with the error field set to 0.  The
       application must generate acknowledgements for received messages
       itself.  The kernel tries to send an <b>NLMSG_ERROR </b>message for
       every failed packet.  A user process should follow this
       convention too.

       However, reliable transmissions from kernel to user are
       impossible in any case.  The kernel can't send a netlink message
       if the socket buffer is full: the message will be dropped and the
       kernel and the user-space process will no longer have the same
       view of kernel state.  It is up to the application to detect when
       this happens (via the <b>ENOBUFS </b>error returned by <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/recvmsg.2.html">recvmsg(2)</a>) and
       resynchronize.

   <b>Address formats</b>
       The <i>sockaddr_nl</i> structure describes a netlink client in user
       space or in the kernel.  A <i>sockaddr_nl</i> can be either unicast
       (only sent to one peer) or sent to netlink multicast groups
       (<i>nl_groups</i> not equal 0).

           struct sockaddr_nl {
               sa_family_t     nl_family;  /* AF_NETLINK */
               unsigned short  nl_pad;     /* Zero */
               pid_t           nl_pid;     /* Port ID */
               __u32           nl_groups;  /* Multicast groups mask */
           };

       <i>nl_pid</i> is the unicast address of netlink socket.  It's always 0
       if the destination is in the kernel.  For a user-space process,
       <i>nl_pid</i> is usually the PID of the process owning the destination
       socket.  However, <i>nl_pid</i> identifies a netlink socket, not a
       process.  If a process owns several netlink sockets, then <i>nl_pid</i>
       can be equal to the process ID only for at most one socket.
       There are two ways to assign <i>nl_pid</i> to a netlink socket.  If the
       application sets <i>nl_pid</i> before calling <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/bind.2.html">bind(2)</a>, then it is up to
       the application to make sure that <i>nl_pid</i> is unique.  If the
       application sets it to 0, the kernel takes care of assigning it.
       The kernel assigns the process ID to the first netlink socket the
       process opens and assigns a unique <i>nl_pid</i> to every netlink socket
       that the process subsequently creates.

       <i>nl_groups</i> is a bit mask with every bit representing a netlink
       group number.  Each netlink family has a set of 32 multicast
       groups.  When <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/bind.2.html">bind(2)</a> is called on the socket, the <i>nl_groups</i>
       field in the <i>sockaddr_nl</i> should be set to a bit mask of the
       groups which it wishes to listen to.  The default value for this
       field is zero which means that no multicasts will be received.  A
       socket may multicast messages to any of the multicast groups by
       setting <i>nl_groups</i> to a bit mask of the groups it wishes to send
       to when it calls <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sendmsg.2.html">sendmsg(2)</a> or does a <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/connect.2.html">connect(2)</a>.  Only processes
       with an effective UID of 0 or the <b>CAP_NET_ADMIN </b>capability may
       send or listen to a netlink multicast group.  Since Linux 2.6.13,
       messages can't be broadcast to multiple groups.  Any replies to a
       message received for a multicast group should be sent back to the
       sending PID and the multicast group.  Some Linux kernel
       subsystems may additionally allow other users to send and/or
       receive messages.  As at Linux 3.0, the <b>NETLINK_KOBJECT_UEVENT</b>,
       <b>NETLINK_GENERIC</b>, <b>NETLINK_ROUTE</b>, and <b>NETLINK_SELINUX </b>groups allow
       other users to receive messages.  No groups allow other users to
       send messages.

   <b>Socket options</b>
       To set or get a netlink socket option, call <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getsockopt.2.html">getsockopt(2)</a> to read
       or <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setsockopt.2.html">setsockopt(2)</a> to write the option with the option level
       argument set to <b>SOL_NETLINK</b>.  Unless otherwise noted, <i>optval</i> is a
       pointer to an <i>int</i>.

       <b>NETLINK_PKTINFO </b>(since Linux 2.6.14)
              Enable <b>nl_pktinfo </b>control messages for received packets to
              get the extended destination group number.

       <b>NETLINK_ADD_MEMBERSHIP</b>, <b>NETLINK_DROP_MEMBERSHIP </b>(since Linux
       2.6.14)
              Join/leave a group specified by <i>optval</i>.

       <b>NETLINK_LIST_MEMBERSHIPS </b>(since Linux 4.2)
              Retrieve all groups a socket is a member of.  <i>optval</i> is a
              pointer to <b>__u32 </b>and <i>optlen</i> is the size of the array.  The
              array is filled with the full membership set of the
              socket, and the required array size is returned in <i>optlen</i>.

       <b>NETLINK_BROADCAST_ERROR </b>(since Linux 2.6.30)
              When not set, <b>netlink_broadcast() </b>only reports <b>ESRCH</b>
              errors and silently ignore <b>ENOBUFS </b>errors.

       <b>NETLINK_NO_ENOBUFS </b>(since Linux 2.6.30)
              This flag can be used by unicast and broadcast listeners
              to avoid receiving <b>ENOBUFS </b>errors.

       <b>NETLINK_LISTEN_ALL_NSID </b>(since Linux 4.2)
              When set, this socket will receive netlink notifications
              from all network namespaces that have an <i>nsid</i> assigned
              into the network namespace where the socket has been
              opened.  The <i>nsid</i> is sent to user space via an ancillary
              data.

       <b>NETLINK_CAP_ACK </b>(since Linux 4.3)
              The kernel may fail to allocate the necessary room for the
              acknowledgement message back to user space.  This option
              trims off the payload of the original netlink message.
              The netlink message header is still included, so the user
              can guess from the sequence number which message triggered
              the acknowledgement.
