       Annotates each line in the given file with information from the
       commit which introduced the line. Optionally annotates from a
       given revision.

       The only difference between this command and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/git-blame.1.html">git-blame(1)</a> is that
       they use slightly different output formats, and this command
       exists only for backward compatibility to support existing
       scripts, and provide a more familiar command name for people
       coming from other SCM systems.
