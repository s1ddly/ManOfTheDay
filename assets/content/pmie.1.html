       <b>pmie </b>accepts a collection of arithmetic, logical, and rule
       expressions to be evaluated at specified frequencies.  The base
       data for the expressions consists of performance metrics values
       delivered in real-time from any host running the Performance
       Metrics Collection Daemon (PMCD), or using historical data from
       Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) archive logs.

       As well as computing arithmetic and logical values, <b>pmie </b>can
       execute actions (popup alarms, write system log messages, and
       launch programs) in response to specified conditions.  Such
       actions are extremely useful in detecting, monitoring and
       correcting performance related problems.

       The expressions to be evaluated are read from configuration files
       specified by one or more <i>filename</i> arguments.  In the absence of
       any <i>filename</i>, expressions are read from standard input.

       Output from <b>pmie </b>is directed to standard output and standard
       error as follows:

       <b>stdout</b>
            Expression values printed in the verbose <b>-v </b>mode and the
            output of <b>print </b>actions.

       <b>stderr</b>
            Error and warning messages for any syntactic or semantic
            problems during expression parsing, and any semantic or
            performance metrics availability problems during expression
            evaluation.
