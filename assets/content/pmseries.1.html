       <b>pmseries </b>displays various types of information about performance
       metrics available through the scalable timeseries facilities of
       the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) and the Redis distributed data
       store.

       By default <b>pmseries </b>communicates with a local <b>redis-server</b>(1),
       however the <b>-h </b>and <b>-p </b>options can be used to specify an alternate
       Redis instance.  If this instance is a node of a Redis cluster,
       all other instances in the cluster will be discovered and used
       automatically.

       <b>pmseries </b>runs in several different modes - either querying
       timeseries identifiers, metadata or values (already stored in
       Redis), or manually loading timeseries into Redis.  The latter
       mode is seldom used, however, since <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmproxy.1.html">pmproxy(1)</a> will automatically
       perform this function for local <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> instances, when
       running in its default time series mode.

       Without command line options specifying otherwise, <b>pmseries </b>will
       issue a timeseries query to find matching timeseries and values.
       All timeseries are identified using a unique SHA-1 hash which is
       always displayed in a 40-hexdigit human readable form.  These
       hashes are formed using the metadata associated with every
       metric.

       Importantly, this includes all metric metadata (labels, names,
       descriptors).  Metric labels in particular are (as far as
       possible) unique for every machine - on Linux for example the
       labels associated with every metric include the unique
       <i>/etc/machine-id</i>, the hostname, domainname, and other
       automatically generated machine labels, as well as any
       administrator-defined labels from <i>/etc/pcp/labels</i>.  These labels
       can be reported with <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pminfo.1.html">pminfo(1)</a> and the <i>pmcd.labels</i> metric.

       See <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/pmLookupLabels.3.html">pmLookupLabels(3)</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/pmLookupInDom.3.html">pmLookupInDom(3)</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/pmLookupName.3.html">pmLookupName(3)</a> and
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/pmLookupDesc.3.html">pmLookupDesc(3)</a> for detailed information about metric labels and
       other metric metadata used in each timeseries identifier hash
       calculation.

       The timeseries identifiers provide a higher level (and machine
       independent) identifier than the traditional PCP performance
       metric identifiers (pmID), instance domain identifiers (pmInDom)
       and metric names.  See <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/PCPIntro.1.html">PCPIntro(1)</a> for more details about these
       traditional identifiers.  However, <b>pmseries </b>uses timeseries
       identifiers in much the same way that <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pminfo.1.html">pminfo(1)</a> uses the lower
       level indom, metric identifiers and metric names.

       The default mode of <b>pmseries </b>operation (i.e. with no command line
       options) depends on the arguments it is presented.  If all non-
       option arguments appear to be timeseries identifiers (in 40 hex
       digit form) <b>pmseries </b>will report metadata for these timeseries -
       refer to the <b>-a </b>option for details.  Otherwise, the parameters
       will be treated as a timeseries query.
