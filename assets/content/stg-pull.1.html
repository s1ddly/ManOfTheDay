       Pull the latest changes from the given remote repository
       (defaulting to branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote, or <i>origin</i> if not set). This
       command works by popping all the patches from the stack, pulling
       the changes in the parent repository, setting the base of the
       stack to the latest parent HEAD and pushing the patches back
       (unless <i>--nopush</i> is specified). The <i>push</i> operation can fail if
       there are conflicts. They need to be resolved and the patch
       pushed again.

       Check the <i>git fetch</i> documentation for the &lt;repository&gt; format.
