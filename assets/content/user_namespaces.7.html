       For an overview of namespaces, see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/namespaces.7.html">namespaces(7)</a>.

       User namespaces isolate security-related identifiers and
       attributes, in particular, user IDs and group IDs (see
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/credentials.7.html">credentials(7)</a>), the root directory, keys (see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/keyrings.7.html">keyrings(7)</a>), and
       capabilities (see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html">capabilities(7)</a>).  A process's user and group
       IDs can be different inside and outside a user namespace.  In
       particular, a process can have a normal unprivileged user ID
       outside a user namespace while at the same time having a user ID
       of 0 inside the namespace; in other words, the process has full
       privileges for operations inside the user namespace, but is
       unprivileged for operations outside the namespace.

   <b>Nested namespaces, namespace membership</b>
       User namespaces can be nested; that is, each user namespace—
       except the initial ("root") namespace—has a parent user
       namespace, and can have zero or more child user namespaces.  The
       parent user namespace is the user namespace of the process that
       creates the user namespace via a call to <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/unshare.2.html">unshare(2)</a> or <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/clone.2.html">clone(2)</a>
       with the <b>CLONE_NEWUSER </b>flag.

       The kernel imposes (since version 3.11) a limit of 32 nested
       levels of user namespaces.  Calls to <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/unshare.2.html">unshare(2)</a> or <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/clone.2.html">clone(2)</a> that
       would cause this limit to be exceeded fail with the error <b>EUSERS</b>.

       Each process is a member of exactly one user namespace.  A
       process created via <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fork.2.html">fork(2)</a> or <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/clone.2.html">clone(2)</a> without the <b>CLONE_NEWUSER</b>
       flag is a member of the same user namespace as its parent.  A
       single-threaded process can join another user namespace with
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setns.2.html">setns(2)</a> if it has the <b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN </b>in that namespace; upon
       doing so, it gains a full set of capabilities in that namespace.

       A call to <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/clone.2.html">clone(2)</a> or <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/unshare.2.html">unshare(2)</a> with the <b>CLONE_NEWUSER </b>flag
       makes the new child process (for <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/clone.2.html">clone(2)</a>) or the caller (for
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/unshare.2.html">unshare(2)</a>) a member of the new user namespace created by the
       call.

       The <b>NS_GET_PARENT ioctl</b>(2) operation can be used to discover the
       parental relationship between user namespaces; see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ioctl_ns.2.html">ioctl_ns(2)</a>.

   <b>Capabilities</b>
       The child process created by <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/clone.2.html">clone(2)</a> with the <b>CLONE_NEWUSER </b>flag
       starts out with a complete set of capabilities in the new user
       namespace.  Likewise, a process that creates a new user namespace
       using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/unshare.2.html">unshare(2)</a> or joins an existing user namespace using
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setns.2.html">setns(2)</a> gains a full set of capabilities in that namespace.  On
       the other hand, that process has no capabilities in the parent
       (in the case of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/clone.2.html">clone(2)</a>) or previous (in the case of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/unshare.2.html">unshare(2)</a>
       and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setns.2.html">setns(2)</a>) user namespace, even if the new namespace is
       created or joined by the root user (i.e., a process with user ID
       0 in the root namespace).

       Note that a call to <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/execve.2.html">execve(2)</a> will cause a process's capabilities
       to be recalculated in the usual way (see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html">capabilities(7)</a>).
       Consequently, unless the process has a user ID of 0 within the
       namespace, or the executable file has a nonempty inheritable
       capabilities mask, the process will lose all capabilities.  See
       the discussion of user and group ID mappings, below.

       A call to <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/clone.2.html">clone(2)</a> or <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/unshare.2.html">unshare(2)</a> using the <b>CLONE_NEWUSER </b>flag or
       a call to <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setns.2.html">setns(2)</a> that moves the caller into another user
       namespace sets the "securebits" flags (see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html">capabilities(7)</a>) to
       their default values (all flags disabled) in the child (for
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/clone.2.html">clone(2)</a>) or caller (for <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/unshare.2.html">unshare(2)</a> or <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setns.2.html">setns(2)</a>).  Note that
       because the caller no longer has capabilities in its original
       user namespace after a call to <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setns.2.html">setns(2)</a>, it is not possible for a
       process to reset its "securebits" flags while retaining its user
       namespace membership by using a pair of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setns.2.html">setns(2)</a> calls to move to
       another user namespace and then return to its original user
       namespace.

       The rules for determining whether or not a process has a
       capability in a particular user namespace are as follows:

       1. A process has a capability inside a user namespace if it is a
          member of that namespace and it has the capability in its
          effective capability set.  A process can gain capabilities in
          its effective capability set in various ways.  For example, it
          may execute a set-user-ID program or an executable with
          associated file capabilities.  In addition, a process may gain
          capabilities via the effect of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/clone.2.html">clone(2)</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/unshare.2.html">unshare(2)</a>, or
          <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setns.2.html">setns(2)</a>, as already described.

       2. If a process has a capability in a user namespace, then it has
          that capability in all child (and further removed descendant)
          namespaces as well.

       3. When a user namespace is created, the kernel records the
          effective user ID of the creating process as being the "owner"
          of the namespace.  A process that resides in the parent of the
          user namespace and whose effective user ID matches the owner
          of the namespace has all capabilities in the namespace.  By
          virtue of the previous rule, this means that the process has
          all capabilities in all further removed descendant user
          namespaces as well.  The <b>NS_GET_OWNER_UID ioctl</b>(2) operation
          can be used to discover the user ID of the owner of the
          namespace; see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ioctl_ns.2.html">ioctl_ns(2)</a>.

   <b>Effect of capabilities within a user namespace</b>
       Having a capability inside a user namespace permits a process to
       perform operations (that require privilege) only on resources
       governed by that namespace.  In other words, having a capability
       in a user namespace permits a process to perform privileged
       operations on resources that are governed by (nonuser) namespaces
       owned by (associated with) the user namespace (see the next
       subsection).

       On the other hand, there are many privileged operations that
       affect resources that are not associated with any namespace type,
       for example, changing the system (i.e., calendar) time (governed
       by <b>CAP_SYS_TIME</b>), loading a kernel module (governed by
       <b>CAP_SYS_MODULE</b>), and creating a device (governed by <b>CAP_MKNOD</b>).
       Only a process with privileges in the <i>initial</i> user namespace can
       perform such operations.

       Holding <b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN </b>within the user namespace that owns a
       process's mount namespace allows that process to create bind
       mounts and mount the following types of filesystems:

           * <i>/proc</i> (since Linux 3.8)
           * <i>/sys</i> (since Linux 3.8)
           * <i>devpts</i> (since Linux 3.9)
           * <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/tmpfs.5.html">tmpfs(5)</a> (since Linux 3.9)
           * <i>ramfs</i> (since Linux 3.9)
           * <i>mqueue</i> (since Linux 3.9)
           * <i>bpf</i> (since Linux 4.4)
           * <i>overlayfs</i> (since Linux 5.11)

       Holding <b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN </b>within the user namespace that owns a
       process's cgroup namespace allows (since Linux 4.6) that process
       to the mount the cgroup version 2 filesystem and cgroup version 1
       named hierarchies (i.e., cgroup filesystems mounted with the
       <i>"none,name="</i> option).

       Holding <b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN </b>within the user namespace that owns a
       process's PID namespace allows (since Linux 3.8) that process to
       mount <i>/proc</i> filesystems.

       Note, however, that mounting block-based filesystems can be done
       only by a process that holds <b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN </b>in the initial user
       namespace.

   <b>Interaction of user namespaces and other types of namespaces</b>
       Starting in Linux 3.8, unprivileged processes can create user
       namespaces, and the other types of namespaces can be created with
       just the <b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN </b>capability in the caller's user namespace.

       When a nonuser namespace is created, it is owned by the user
       namespace in which the creating process was a member at the time
       of the creation of the namespace.  Privileged operations on
       resources governed by the nonuser namespace require that the
       process has the necessary capabilities in the user namespace that
       owns the nonuser namespace.

       If <b>CLONE_NEWUSER </b>is specified along with other <b>CLONE_NEW* </b>flags
       in a single <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/clone.2.html">clone(2)</a> or <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/unshare.2.html">unshare(2)</a> call, the user namespace is
       guaranteed to be created first, giving the child (<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/clone.2.html">clone(2)</a>) or
       caller (<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/unshare.2.html">unshare(2)</a>) privileges over the remaining namespaces
       created by the call.  Thus, it is possible for an unprivileged
       caller to specify this combination of flags.

       When a new namespace (other than a user namespace) is created via
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/clone.2.html">clone(2)</a> or <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/unshare.2.html">unshare(2)</a>, the kernel records the user namespace of
       the creating process as the owner of the new namespace.  (This
       association can't be changed.)  When a process in the new
       namespace subsequently performs privileged operations that
       operate on global resources isolated by the namespace, the
       permission checks are performed according to the process's
       capabilities in the user namespace that the kernel associated
       with the new namespace.  For example, suppose that a process
       attempts to change the hostname (<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sethostname.2.html">sethostname(2)</a>), a resource
       governed by the UTS namespace.  In this case, the kernel will
       determine which user namespace owns the process's UTS namespace,
       and check whether the process has the required capability
       (<b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</b>) in that user namespace.

       The <b>NS_GET_USERNS ioctl</b>(2) operation can be used to discover the
       user namespace that owns a nonuser namespace; see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ioctl_ns.2.html">ioctl_ns(2)</a>.

   <b>User and group ID mappings: uid_map and gid_map</b>
       When a user namespace is created, it starts out without a mapping
       of user IDs (group IDs) to the parent user namespace.  The
       <i>/proc/[pid]/uid_map</i> and <i>/proc/[pid]/gid_map</i> files (available
       since Linux 3.5) expose the mappings for user and group IDs
       inside the user namespace for the process <i>pid</i>.  These files can
       be read to view the mappings in a user namespace and written to
       (once) to define the mappings.

       The description in the following paragraphs explains the details
       for <i>uid_map</i>; <i>gid_map</i> is exactly the same, but each instance of
       "user ID" is replaced by "group ID".

       The <i>uid_map</i> file exposes the mapping of user IDs from the user
       namespace of the process <i>pid</i> to the user namespace of the process
       that opened <i>uid_map</i> (but see a qualification to this point
       below).  In other words, processes that are in different user
       namespaces will potentially see different values when reading
       from a particular <i>uid_map</i> file, depending on the user ID mappings
       for the user namespaces of the reading processes.

       Each line in the <i>uid_map</i> file specifies a 1-to-1 mapping of a
       range of contiguous user IDs between two user namespaces.  (When
       a user namespace is first created, this file is empty.)  The
       specification in each line takes the form of three numbers
       delimited by white space.  The first two numbers specify the
       starting user ID in each of the two user namespaces.  The third
       number specifies the length of the mapped range.  In detail, the
       fields are interpreted as follows:

       (1) The start of the range of user IDs in the user namespace of
           the process <i>pid</i>.

       (2) The start of the range of user IDs to which the user IDs
           specified by field one map.  How field two is interpreted
           depends on whether the process that opened <i>uid_map</i> and the
           process <i>pid</i> are in the same user namespace, as follows:

           a) If the two processes are in different user namespaces:
              field two is the start of a range of user IDs in the user
              namespace of the process that opened <i>uid_map</i>.

           b) If the two processes are in the same user namespace: field
              two is the start of the range of user IDs in the parent
              user namespace of the process <i>pid</i>.  This case enables the
              opener of <i>uid_map</i> (the common case here is opening
              <i>/proc/self/uid_map</i>) to see the mapping of user IDs into
              the user namespace of the process that created this user
              namespace.

       (3) The length of the range of user IDs that is mapped between
           the two user namespaces.

       System calls that return user IDs (group IDs)—for example,
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getuid.2.html">getuid(2)</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getgid.2.html">getgid(2)</a>, and the credential fields in the structure
       returned by <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/stat.2.html">stat(2)</a>—return the user ID (group ID) mapped into the
       caller's user namespace.

       When a process accesses a file, its user and group IDs are mapped
       into the initial user namespace for the purpose of permission
       checking and assigning IDs when creating a file.  When a process
       retrieves file user and group IDs via <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/stat.2.html">stat(2)</a>, the IDs are mapped
       in the opposite direction, to produce values relative to the
       process user and group ID mappings.

       The initial user namespace has no parent namespace, but, for
       consistency, the kernel provides dummy user and group ID mapping
       files for this namespace.  Looking at the <i>uid_map</i> file (<i>gid_map</i>
       is the same) from a shell in the initial namespace shows:

           $ <b>cat /proc/$$/uid_map</b>
                    0          0 4294967295

       This mapping tells us that the range starting at user ID 0 in
       this namespace maps to a range starting at 0 in the (nonexistent)
       parent namespace, and the length of the range is the largest
       32-bit unsigned integer.  This leaves 4294967295 (the 32-bit
       signed -1 value) unmapped.  This is deliberate: <i>(uid_t) -1</i> is
       used in several interfaces (e.g., <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setreuid.2.html">setreuid(2)</a>) as a way to
       specify "no user ID".  Leaving <i>(uid_t) -1</i> unmapped and unusable
       guarantees that there will be no confusion when using these
       interfaces.

   <b>Defining user and group ID mappings: writing to uid_map and gid_map</b>
       After the creation of a new user namespace, the <i>uid_map</i> file of
       <i>one</i> of the processes in the namespace may be written to <i>once</i> to
       define the mapping of user IDs in the new user namespace.  An
       attempt to write more than once to a <i>uid_map</i> file in a user
       namespace fails with the error <b>EPERM</b>.  Similar rules apply for
       <i>gid_map</i> files.

       The lines written to <i>uid_map</i> (<i>gid_map</i>) must conform to the
       following validity rules:

       *  The three fields must be valid numbers, and the last field
          must be greater than 0.

       *  Lines are terminated by newline characters.

       *  There is a limit on the number of lines in the file.  In Linux
          4.14 and earlier, this limit was (arbitrarily) set at 5 lines.
          Since Linux 4.15, the limit is 340 lines.  In addition, the
          number of bytes written to the file must be less than the
          system page size, and the write must be performed at the start
          of the file (i.e., <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/lseek.2.html">lseek(2)</a> and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/pwrite.2.html">pwrite(2)</a> can't be used to
          write to nonzero offsets in the file).

       *  The range of user IDs (group IDs) specified in each line
          cannot overlap with the ranges in any other lines.  In the
          initial implementation (Linux 3.8), this requirement was
          satisfied by a simplistic implementation that imposed the
          further requirement that the values in both field 1 and field
          2 of successive lines must be in ascending numerical order,
          which prevented some otherwise valid maps from being created.
          Linux 3.9 and later fix this limitation, allowing any valid
          set of nonoverlapping maps.

       *  At least one line must be written to the file.

       Writes that violate the above rules fail with the error <b>EINVAL</b>.

       In order for a process to write to the <i>/proc/[pid]/uid_map</i>
       (<i>/proc/[pid]/gid_map</i>) file, all of the following permission
       requirements must be met:

       1. The writing process must have the <b>CAP_SETUID </b>(<b>CAP_SETGID</b>)
          capability in the user namespace of the process <i>pid</i>.

       2. The writing process must either be in the user namespace of
          the process <i>pid</i> or be in the parent user namespace of the
          process <i>pid</i>.

       3. The mapped user IDs (group IDs) must in turn have a mapping in
          the parent user namespace.

       4. If updating <i>/proc/[pid]/uid_map</i> to create a mapping that maps
          UID 0 in the parent namespace, then one of the following must
          be true:

          *  if writing process is in the parent user namespace, then it
             must have the <b>CAP_SETFCAP </b>capability in that user
             namespace; or

          *  if the writing process is in the child user namespace, then
             the process that created the user namespace must have had
             the <b>CAP_SETFCAP </b>capability when the namespace was created.

          This rule has been in place since Linux 5.12.  It eliminates
          an earlier security bug whereby a UID 0 process that lacks the
          <b>CAP_SETFCAP </b>capability, which is needed to create a binary
          with namespaced file capabilities (as described in
          <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html">capabilities(7)</a>), could nevertheless create such a binary, by
          the following steps:

          *  Create a new user namespace with the identity mapping
             (i.e., UID 0 in the new user namespace maps to UID 0 in the
             parent namespace), so that UID 0 in both namespaces is
             equivalent to the same root user ID.

          *  Since the child process has the <b>CAP_SETFCAP </b>capability, it
             could create a binary with namespaced file capabilities
             that would then be effective in the parent user namespace
             (because the root user IDs are the same in the two
             namespaces).

       5. One of the following two cases applies:

          *  <i>Either</i> the writing process has the <b>CAP_SETUID </b>(<b>CAP_SETGID</b>)
             capability in the <i>parent</i> user namespace.

             +  No further restrictions apply: the process can make
                mappings to arbitrary user IDs (group IDs) in the parent
                user namespace.

          *  <i>Or</i> otherwise all of the following restrictions apply:

             +  The data written to <i>uid_map</i> (<i>gid_map</i>) must consist of a
                single line that maps the writing process's effective
                user ID (group ID) in the parent user namespace to a
                user ID (group ID) in the user namespace.

             +  The writing process must have the same effective user ID
                as the process that created the user namespace.

             +  In the case of <i>gid_map</i>, use of the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setgroups.2.html">setgroups(2)</a> system
                call must first be denied by writing "<i>deny</i>" to the
                <i>/proc/[pid]/setgroups</i> file (see below) before writing to
                <i>gid_map</i>.

       Writes that violate the above rules fail with the error <b>EPERM</b>.

   <b>Project ID mappings: projid_map</b>
       Similarly to user and group ID mappings, it is possible to create
       project ID mappings for a user namespace.  (Project IDs are used
       for disk quotas; see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/setquota.8.html">setquota(8)</a> and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/quotactl.2.html">quotactl(2)</a>.)

       Project ID mappings are defined by writing to the
       <i>/proc/[pid]/projid_map</i> file (present since Linux 3.7).

       The validity rules for writing to the <i>/proc/[pid]/projid_map</i> file
       are as for writing to the <i>uid_map</i> file; violation of these rules
       causes <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/write.2.html">write(2)</a> to fail with the error <b>EINVAL</b>.

       The permission rules for writing to the <i>/proc/[pid]/projid_map</i>
       file are as follows:

       1. The writing process must either be in the user namespace of
          the process <i>pid</i> or be in the parent user namespace of the
          process <i>pid</i>.

       2. The mapped project IDs must in turn have a mapping in the
          parent user namespace.

       Violation of these rules causes <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/write.2.html">write(2)</a> to fail with the error
       <b>EPERM</b>.

   <b>Interaction with system calls that change process UIDs or GIDs</b>
       In a user namespace where the <i>uid_map</i> file has not been written,
       the system calls that change user IDs will fail.  Similarly, if
       the <i>gid_map</i> file has not been written, the system calls that
       change group IDs will fail.  After the <i>uid_map</i> and <i>gid_map</i> files
       have been written, only the mapped values may be used in system
       calls that change user and group IDs.

       For user IDs, the relevant system calls include <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setuid.2.html">setuid(2)</a>,
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setfsuid.2.html">setfsuid(2)</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setreuid.2.html">setreuid(2)</a>, and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setresuid.2.html">setresuid(2)</a>.  For group IDs, the
       relevant system calls include <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setgid.2.html">setgid(2)</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setfsgid.2.html">setfsgid(2)</a>,
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setregid.2.html">setregid(2)</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setresgid.2.html">setresgid(2)</a>, and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setgroups.2.html">setgroups(2)</a>.

       Writing "<i>deny</i>" to the <i>/proc/[pid]/setgroups</i> file before writing
       to <i>/proc/[pid]/gid_map</i> will permanently disable <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setgroups.2.html">setgroups(2)</a> in a
       user namespace and allow writing to <i>/proc/[pid]/gid_map</i> without
       having the <b>CAP_SETGID </b>capability in the parent user namespace.

   <b>The /proc/[pid]/setgroups file</b>
       The <i>/proc/[pid]/setgroups</i> file displays the string "<i>allow</i>" if
       processes in the user namespace that contains the process <i>pid</i> are
       permitted to employ the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setgroups.2.html">setgroups(2)</a> system call; it displays
       "<i>deny</i>" if <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setgroups.2.html">setgroups(2)</a> is not permitted in that user namespace.
       Note that regardless of the value in the <i>/proc/[pid]/setgroups</i>
       file (and regardless of the process's capabilities), calls to
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setgroups.2.html">setgroups(2)</a> are also not permitted if <i>/proc/[pid]/gid_map</i> has
       not yet been set.

       A privileged process (one with the <b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN </b>capability in
       the namespace) may write either of the strings "<i>allow</i>" or "<i>deny</i>"
       to this file <i>before</i> writing a group ID mapping for this user
       namespace to the file <i>/proc/[pid]/gid_map</i>.  Writing the string
       "<i>deny</i>" prevents any process in the user namespace from employing
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setgroups.2.html">setgroups(2)</a>.

       The essence of the restrictions described in the preceding
       paragraph is that it is permitted to write to
       <i>/proc/[pid]/setgroups</i> only so long as calling <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setgroups.2.html">setgroups(2)</a> is
       disallowed because <i>/proc/[pid]/gid_map</i> has not been set.  This
       ensures that a process cannot transition from a state where
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setgroups.2.html">setgroups(2)</a> is allowed to a state where <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setgroups.2.html">setgroups(2)</a> is denied;
       a process can transition only from <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setgroups.2.html">setgroups(2)</a> being disallowed
       to <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setgroups.2.html">setgroups(2)</a> being allowed.

       The default value of this file in the initial user namespace is
       "<i>allow</i>".

       Once <i>/proc/[pid]/gid_map</i> has been written to (which has the
       effect of enabling <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setgroups.2.html">setgroups(2)</a> in the user namespace), it is no
       longer possible to disallow <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setgroups.2.html">setgroups(2)</a> by writing "<i>deny</i>" to
       <i>/proc/[pid]/setgroups</i> (the write fails with the error <b>EPERM</b>).

       A child user namespace inherits the <i>/proc/[pid]/setgroups</i> setting
       from its parent.

       If the <i>setgroups</i> file has the value "<i>deny</i>", then the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setgroups.2.html">setgroups(2)</a>
       system call can't subsequently be reenabled (by writing "<i>allow</i>"
       to the file) in this user namespace.  (Attempts to do so fail
       with the error <b>EPERM</b>.)  This restriction also propagates down to
       all child user namespaces of this user namespace.

       The <i>/proc/[pid]/setgroups</i> file was added in Linux 3.19, but was
       backported to many earlier stable kernel series, because it
       addresses a security issue.  The issue concerned files with
       permissions such as "rwx---rwx".  Such files give fewer
       permissions to "group" than they do to "other".  This means that
       dropping groups using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setgroups.2.html">setgroups(2)</a> might allow a process file
       access that it did not formerly have.  Before the existence of
       user namespaces this was not a concern, since only a privileged
       process (one with the <b>CAP_SETGID </b>capability) could call
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setgroups.2.html">setgroups(2)</a>.  However, with the introduction of user namespaces,
       it became possible for an unprivileged process to create a new
       namespace in which the user had all privileges.  This then
       allowed formerly unprivileged users to drop groups and thus gain
       file access that they did not previously have.  The
       <i>/proc/[pid]/setgroups</i> file was added to address this security
       issue, by denying any pathway for an unprivileged process to drop
       groups with <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setgroups.2.html">setgroups(2)</a>.

   <b>Unmapped user and group IDs</b>
       There are various places where an unmapped user ID (group ID) may
       be exposed to user space.  For example, the first process in a
       new user namespace may call <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getuid.2.html">getuid(2)</a> before a user ID mapping
       has been defined for the namespace.  In most such cases, an
       unmapped user ID is converted to the overflow user ID (group ID);
       the default value for the overflow user ID (group ID) is 65534.
       See the descriptions of <i>/proc/sys/kernel/overflowuid</i> and
       <i>/proc/sys/kernel/overflowgid</i> in <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/proc.5.html">proc(5)</a>.

       The cases where unmapped IDs are mapped in this fashion include
       system calls that return user IDs (<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getuid.2.html">getuid(2)</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getgid.2.html">getgid(2)</a>, and
       similar), credentials passed over a UNIX domain socket,
       credentials returned by <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/stat.2.html">stat(2)</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/waitid.2.html">waitid(2)</a>, and the System V IPC
       "ctl" <b>IPC_STAT </b>operations, credentials exposed by
       <i>/proc/[pid]/status</i> and the files in <i>/proc/sysvipc/*</i>, credentials
       returned via the <i>si_uid</i> field in the <i>siginfo_t</i> received with a
       signal (see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sigaction.2.html">sigaction(2)</a>), credentials written to the process
       accounting file (see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/acct.5.html">acct(5)</a>), and credentials returned with
       POSIX message queue notifications (see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/mq_notify.3.html">mq_notify(3)</a>).

       There is one notable case where unmapped user and group IDs are
       <i>not</i> converted to the corresponding overflow ID value.  When
       viewing a <i>uid_map</i> or <i>gid_map</i> file in which there is no mapping
       for the second field, that field is displayed as 4294967295 (-1
       as an unsigned integer).

   <b>Accessing files</b>
       In order to determine permissions when an unprivileged process
       accesses a file, the process credentials (UID, GID) and the file
       credentials are in effect mapped back to what they would be in
       the initial user namespace and then compared to determine the
       permissions that the process has on the file.  The same is also
       of other objects that employ the credentials plus permissions
       mask accessibility model, such as System V IPC objects

   <b>Operation of file-related capabilities</b>
       Certain capabilities allow a process to bypass various kernel-
       enforced restrictions when performing operations on files owned
       by other users or groups.  These capabilities are: <b>CAP_CHOWN</b>,
       <b>CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE</b>, <b>CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH</b>, <b>CAP_FOWNER</b>, and
       <b>CAP_FSETID</b>.

       Within a user namespace, these capabilities allow a process to
       bypass the rules if the process has the relevant capability over
       the file, meaning that:

       *  the process has the relevant effective capability in its user
          namespace; and

       *  the file's user ID and group ID both have valid mappings in
          the user namespace.

       The <b>CAP_FOWNER </b>capability is treated somewhat exceptionally: it
       allows a process to bypass the corresponding rules so long as at
       least the file's user ID has a mapping in the user namespace
       (i.e., the file's group ID does not need to have a valid
       mapping).

   <b>Set-user-ID and set-group-ID programs</b>
       When a process inside a user namespace executes a set-user-ID
       (set-group-ID) program, the process's effective user (group) ID
       inside the namespace is changed to whatever value is mapped for
       the user (group) ID of the file.  However, if either the user <i>or</i>
       the group ID of the file has no mapping inside the namespace, the
       set-user-ID (set-group-ID) bit is silently ignored: the new
       program is executed, but the process's effective user (group) ID
       is left unchanged.  (This mirrors the semantics of executing a
       set-user-ID or set-group-ID program that resides on a filesystem
       that was mounted with the <b>MS_NOSUID </b>flag, as described in
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mount.2.html">mount(2)</a>.)

   <b>Miscellaneous</b>
       When a process's user and group IDs are passed over a UNIX domain
       socket to a process in a different user namespace (see the
       description of <b>SCM_CREDENTIALS </b>in <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/unix.7.html">unix(7)</a>), they are translated
       into the corresponding values as per the receiving process's user
       and group ID mappings.
