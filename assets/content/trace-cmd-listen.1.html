<pre>
       The trace-cmd(1) listen sets up a port to listen to waiting for
       connections from other hosts that run <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/trace-cmd-record.1.html">trace-cmd-record(1)</a> with
       the <b>-N </b>option. When a connection is made, and the remote host
       sends data, it will create a file called <i>trace.HOST:PORT.dat</i>.
       Where HOST is the name of the remote host, and PORT is the port
       that the remote host used to connect with.
