       <b>systemd-mount </b>may be used to create and start a transient .mount
       or .automount unit of the file system <i>WHAT</i> on the mount point
       <i>WHERE</i>.

       In many ways, <b>systemd-mount </b>is similar to the lower-level
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/mount.8.html">mount(8)</a> command, however instead of executing the mount
       operation directly and immediately, <b>systemd-mount </b>schedules it
       through the service manager job queue, so that it may pull in
       further dependencies (such as parent mounts, or a file system
       checker to execute a priori), and may make use of the
       auto-mounting logic.

       The command takes either one or two arguments. If only one
       argument is specified it should refer to a block device or
       regular file containing a file system (e.g.  "/dev/sdb1" or
       "/path/to/disk.img"). The block device or image file is then
       probed for a file system label and other metadata, and is mounted
       to a directory below /run/media/system/ whose name is generated
       from the file system label. In this mode the block device or
       image file must exist at the time of invocation of the command,
       so that it may be probed. If the device is found to be a
       removable block device (e.g. a USB stick), an automount point is
       created instead of a regular mount point (i.e. the <b>--automount=</b>
       option is implied, see below).

       If two arguments are specified, the first indicates the mount
       source (the <i>WHAT</i>) and the second indicates the path to mount it
       on (the <i>WHERE</i>). In this mode no probing of the source is
       attempted, and a backing device node doesn't have to exist.
       However, if this mode is combined with <b>--discover</b>, device node
       probing for additional metadata is enabled, and – much like in
       the single-argument case discussed above – the specified device
       has to exist at the time of invocation of the command.

       Use the <b>--list </b>command to show a terse table of all local, known
       block devices with file systems that may be mounted with this
       command.

       <b>systemd-umount </b>can be used to unmount a mount or automount point.
       It is the same as <b>systemd-mount --umount</b>.
