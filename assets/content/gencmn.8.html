       <b>gencmn </b>takes a set of files and packages them as an ICU memory-
       mappable data file. The resulting data file can then be used
       directly by ICU.

       <b>gencmn </b>reads a list of files to be packaged from either the
       supplied <i>listfilename</i> file, or from its standard output. It
       packages all the files from the list that are not bigger than
       <i>maxsize</i> bytes, except if <i>maxsize</i> is 0, which indicates that there
       is no size limit on files.
