       <b>xfs_ncheck </b>with no <b>-i </b>arguments generates an inode number and
       pathname list of all files on the given filesystem. Names of
       directory files are followed by <b>/.</b>.  The output is not sorted in
       any particular order.  The filesystem to be examined is specified
       by the <i>device</i> argument, which should be the disk or volume device
       for the filesystem.  Filesystems stored in files can also be
       checked, using the <b>-f </b>flag.
