<pre>
       The <i>admin</i> utility shall create new SCCS files or change
       parameters of existing ones. If a named file does not exist, it
       shall be created, and its parameters shall be initialized
       according to the specified options.  Parameters not initialized
       by an option shall be assigned a default value. If a named file
       does exist, parameters corresponding to specified options shall
       be changed, and other parameters shall be left as is.

       All SCCS filenames supplied by the application shall be of the
       form s.<i>filename</i>. New SCCS files shall be given read-only
       permission mode. Write permission in the parent directory is
       required to create a file. All writing done by <i>admin</i> shall be to
       a temporary <i>x-file</i>, named x.<i>filename</i> (see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/get.1p.html">get(1p)</a>) created with
       read-only mode if <i>admin</i> is creating a new SCCS file, or created
       with the same mode as that of the SCCS file if the file already
       exists. After successful execution of <i>admin</i>, the SCCS file shall
       be removed (if it exists), and the <i>x-file</i> shall be renamed with
       the name of the SCCS file. This ensures that changes are made to
       the SCCS file only if no errors occur.

       The <i>admin</i> utility shall also use a transient lock file (named
       z.<i>filename</i>), which is used to prevent simultaneous updates to the
       SCCS file; see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/get.1p.html">get(1p)</a>.
