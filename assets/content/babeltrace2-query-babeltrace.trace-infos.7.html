<pre>
       The <b>babeltrace.trace-infos </b>Babeltrace 2 query object indicates
       time range information about specific traces and their streams,
       and which output ports of an eventual source component will serve
       the messages for a given stream.

       The <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/babeltrace2-convert.1.html">babeltrace2-convert(1)</a> command queries this object from all
       the source component classes to support the <b>--stream-intersection</b>
       feature.
