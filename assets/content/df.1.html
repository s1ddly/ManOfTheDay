       This manual page documents the GNU version of <b>df</b>.  <b>df </b>displays
       the amount of disk space available on the file system containing
       each file name argument.  If no file name is given, the space
       available on all currently mounted file systems is shown.  Disk
       space is shown in 1K blocks by default, unless the environment
       variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is set, in which case 512-byte blocks
       are used.

       If an argument is the absolute file name of a disk device node
       containing a mounted file system, <b>df </b>shows the space available on
       that file system rather than on the file system containing the
       device node.  This version of <b>df </b>cannot show the space available
       on unmounted file systems, because on most kinds of systems doing
       so requires very nonportable intimate knowledge of file system
       structures.
