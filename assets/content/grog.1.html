       <i>grog</i> reads its input and guesses which <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/groff.1.html">groff(1)</a> options are
       needed to render it.  If no operands are given, or if <i>file</i> is
       “<b>-</b>”, <i>grog</i> reads the standard input stream.  The corresponding
       <i>groff</i> command is normally written to the standard output stream.
       With the option <b>--run</b>, the generated command is written to the
       standard error stream and then executed.
