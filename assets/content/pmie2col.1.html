       <b>pmie2col </b>is a simple tool that converts output from <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmie.1.html">pmie(1)</a> into
       regular column format.  Each column is 7 characters wide (by
       default, may be changed with the <b>-w </b>option) with a single space
       between columns.  That single space can be substituted with an
       alternate delimiter using the <b>-d </b>option (this is useful for
       importing the data into a spreadsheet, for example).

       The precision of the tabulated values from <b>pmie </b>can be specified
       with the <b>-p </b>option (default is 2 decimal places).  This option
       can and will override any width setting in order to present the
       requested precision.

       The <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmie.1.html">pmie(1)</a> configuration must follow these rules:

       (1)    Each <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmie.1.html">pmie(1)</a> expression is of the form ``NAME = expr;''.
              NAME will be used as the column heading, and must contain
              no white space, although special characters can be escaped
              by enclosing NAME in single quotes.

       (2)    The ``expr'' must be a valid <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmie.1.html">pmie(1)</a> expression that
              produces a singular value.

       In addition, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmie.1.html">pmie(1)</a> must be run with the <b>-v </b>command line option.

       It is also possible to use the <b>-e </b>command line to <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmie.1.html">pmie(1)</a> and
       output lines will be prefixed by a timestamp.
