       locale environment, or all public locales, to the standard

       the current locale environment for each locale category as
       determined by the settings of the environment variables defined
       in the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‚Äê2017, <i>Chapter 7</i>,
       <i>Locale</i>.

       assigned to the keywords in the locale categories, as follows:

        *  Specifying a keyword name shall select the named keyword and
           the category containing that keyword.

        *  Specifying a category name shall select the named category
           and all keywords in that category.
