       FQ (Fair Queue) is a classless packet scheduler meant to be
       mostly used for locally generated traffic.  It is designed to
       achieve per flow pacing.  FQ does flow separation, and is able to
       respect pacing requirements set by TCP stack.  All packets
       belonging to a socket are considered as a 'flow'.  For non local
       packets (router workload), packet hash is used as fallback.

       An application can specify a maximum pacing rate using the
       <b>SO_MAX_PACING_RATE </b>setsockopt call.  This packet scheduler adds
       delay between packets to respect rate limitation set on each
       socket. Note that after linux-4.20, linux adopted EDT (Earliest
       Departure Time) and TCP directly sets the appropriate Departure
       Time for each skb.

       Dequeueing happens in a round-robin fashion.  A special FIFO
       queue is reserved for high priority packets ( <b>TC_PRIO_CONTROL</b>
       priority), such packets are always dequeued first.

       FQ is non-work-conserving.

       TCP pacing is good for flows having idle times, as the congestion
       window permits TCP stack to queue a possibly large number of
       packets.  This removes the 'slow start after idle' choice, badly
       hitting large BDP flows and applications delivering chunks of
       data such as video streams.
