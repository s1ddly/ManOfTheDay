       <b>dh_fixperms </b>is a debhelper program that is responsible for
       setting the permissions of files and directories in package build
       directories to a sane state -- a state that complies with Debian
       policy.

       <b>dh_fixperms </b>makes all files in <i>usr/share/doc</i> in the package build
       directory (excluding files in the <i>examples/</i> directory) be mode
       644. It also changes the permissions of all man pages to mode
       644. It removes group and other write permission from all files.
       It removes execute permissions from any libraries, headers, Perl
       modules, or desktop files that have it set. It makes all files in
       the standard <i>bin</i> and <i>sbin</i> directories, <i>usr/games/</i> and <i>etc/init.d</i>
       executable (since v4). Finally, it removes the setuid and setgid
       bits from all files in the package.

       When the <i>Rules-Requires-Root</i> field has the (effective) value of
       <i>binary-targets</i>, <b>dh_fixperms </b>will also reset the ownership of all
       paths to "root:root".
