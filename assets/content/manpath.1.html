       If $<b>MANPATH </b>is set, <b>manpath </b>will simply display its contents and
       issue a warning.  If not, <b>manpath </b>will determine a suitable
       manual page hierarchy search path and display the results.

       The colon-delimited path is determined using information gained
       from the man-db configuration file â€“ (<i>/usr/local/etc/man_db.conf</i>)
       and the user's environment.
