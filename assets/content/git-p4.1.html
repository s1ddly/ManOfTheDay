       This command provides a way to interact with p4 repositories
       using Git.

       Create a new Git repository from an existing p4 repository using
       <i>git p4 clone</i>, giving it one or more p4 depot paths. Incorporate
       new commits from p4 changes with <i>git p4 sync</i>. The <i>sync</i> command is
       also used to include new branches from other p4 depot paths.
       Submit Git changes back to p4 using <i>git p4 submit</i>. The command
       <i>git p4 rebase</i> does a sync plus rebases the current branch onto
       the updated p4 remote branch.
