       jailcheck attaches itself to all sandboxes started by the user
       and performs some basic tests on the sandbox filesystem:

       <b>1. Virtual directories</b>
              jailcheck extracts a list with the main virtual
              directories installed by the sandbox.  These directories
              are build by firejail at startup using --private* and
              --whitelist commands.

       <b>2. Noexec test</b>
              jailcheck inserts executable programs in /home/username,
              /tmp, and /var/tmp directories and tries to run them from
              inside the sandbox, thus testing if the directory is
              executable or not.

       <b>3. Read access test</b>
              jailcheck creates test files in the directories specified
              by the user and tries to read them from inside the
              sandbox.

       <b>4. AppArmor test</b>

       <b>5. Seccomp test</b>

       <b>6. Networking test</b>

       The program is started as root using sudo.
