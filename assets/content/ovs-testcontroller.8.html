       <b>ovs-testcontroller </b>is a simple OpenFlow controller that manages
       any number of switches over the OpenFlow protocol, causing them
       to function as L2 MAC-learning switches or hubs.  It is suitable
       for initial testing of OpenFlow networks.  It is not a necessary
       or desirable part of a production OpenFlow deployment.

       <b>ovs-testcontroller </b>controls one or more OpenFlow switches,
       specified as one or more of the following OpenFlow connection
       methods:

              <b>pssl:</b>[<i>port</i>][<b>:</b><i>host</i>]
              <b>ptcp:</b>[<i>port</i>][<b>:</b><i>host</i>]
                     Listens for OpenFlow connections on <i>port</i>.  The
                     default <i>port</i> is 6653.  By default, connections are
                     allowed from any IPv4 address.  Specify <i>host</i> as an
                     IPv4 address or a bracketed IPv6 address (e.g.
                     <b>ptcp:6653:[::1]</b>).  On Linux, use <b>%</b><i>device</i> to
                     designate a scope for IPv6 link-level addresses,
                     e.g. <b>ptcp:6653:[fe80::1234%eth0]</b>.  DNS names can be
                     used if built with unbound library.  For <b>pssl</b>, the
                     <b>--private-key</b>,<b>--certificate</b>, and <b>--ca-cert </b>options
                     are mandatory.

              <b>punix:</b><i>file</i>
                     Listens for OpenFlow connections on the Unix domain
                     server socket named <i>file</i>.

              <b>ssl:</b><i>host</i>[<b>:</b><i>port</i>]
              <b>tcp:</b><i>host</i>[<b>:</b><i>port</i>]
                     The specified <i>port</i> on the given <i>host</i>, which can be
                     expressed either as a DNS name (if built with
                     unbound library) or an IP address in IPv4 or IPv6
                     address format.  Wrap IPv6 addresses in square
                     brackets, e.g. <b>tcp:[::1]:6653</b>.  On Linux, use
                     <b>%</b><i>device</i> to designate a scope for IPv6 link-level
                     addresses, e.g. <b>tcp:[fe80::1234%eth0]:6653</b>.  For
                     <b>ssl</b>, the <b>--private-key</b>, <b>--certificate</b>, and
                     <b>--ca-cert </b>options are mandatory.

                     If <i>port</i> is not specified, it defaults to 6653.

              <b>unix:</b><i>file</i>
                     On POSIX, a Unix domain server socket named <i>file</i>.

                     On Windows, connect to a local named pipe that is
                     represented by a file created in the path <i>file</i> to
                     mimic the behavior of a Unix domain socket.
