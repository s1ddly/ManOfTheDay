       The GNU <b>size </b>utility lists the section sizes and the total size
       for each of the binary files <i>objfile</i> on its argument list.  By
       default, one line of output is generated for each file or each
       module if the file is an archive.

       <i>objfile</i>... are the files to be examined.  If none are specified,
       the file "a.out" will be used instead.
