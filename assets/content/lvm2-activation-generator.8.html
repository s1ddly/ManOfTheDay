       The lvm2-activation-generator is called by <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/systemd.1.html">systemd(1)</a> on boot to
       generate systemd units at runtime to activate LVM Logical Volumes
       (LVs) when global/event_activation=0 is set in <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/lvm.conf.5.html">lvm.conf(5)</a>.
       These units use <b>vgchange -aay </b>to activate LVs.

       If event_activation=1, the lvm2-activation-generator exits
       immediately without generating any systemd units, and LVM fully
       relies on event-based activation to activate LVs.  In this case,
       event-generated <b>pvscan --cache -aay </b>commands activate LVs.

       These systemd units are generated by lvm2-activation-generator:

       <i>lvm2-activation-early.service</i> is run before systemd's special
       <b>cryptsetup.target </b>to activate LVs that are not layered on top of
       encrypted devices.

       <i>lvm2-activation.service</i> is run after systemd's special
       <b>cryptsetup.target </b>to activate LVs that are layered on top of
       encrypted devices.

       <i>lvm2-activation-net.service</i> is run after systemd's special
       <b>remote-fs-pre.target </b>to activate LVs that are layered on attached
       remote devices.

       Note that all the underlying LVM devices (Physical Volumes) need
       to be present when the service is run. If the there are any
       devices that appear to the system later, LVs using these devices
       need to be activated directly by <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/lvchange.8.html">lvchange(8)</a> or <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/vgchange.8.html">vgchange(8)</a>.

       The lvm2-activation-generator implements the <b>Generators</b>
       <b>Specification </b>as referenced in <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/systemd.1.html">systemd(1)</a>.
