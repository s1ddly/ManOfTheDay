<pre>
       The <i>bc</i> utility shall implement an arbitrary precision calculator.
       It shall take input from any files given, then read from the
       standard input. If the standard input and standard output to <i>bc</i>
       are attached to a terminal, the invocation of <i>bc</i> shall be
       considered to be <i>interactive</i>, causing behavioral constraints
       described in the following sections.
