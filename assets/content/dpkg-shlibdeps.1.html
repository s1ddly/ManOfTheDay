       <b>dpkg-shlibdeps </b>calculates shared library dependencies for
       executables named in its arguments. The dependencies are added to
       the substitution variables file <b>debian/substvars </b>as variable
       names <b>shlibs:</b><i>dependency-field</i> where <i>dependency-field</i> is a
       dependency field name. Any other variables starting with <b>shlibs:</b>
       are removed from the file.

       <b>dpkg-shlibdeps </b>has two possible sources of information to
       generate dependency information. Either <i>symbols</i> files or <i>shlibs</i>
       files. For each binary that <b>dpkg-shlibdeps </b>analyzes, it finds out
       the list of libraries that it's linked with.  Then, for each
       library, it looks up either the <i>symbols</i> file, or the <i>shlibs</i> file
       (if the former doesn't exist or if debian/shlibs.local contains
       the relevant dependency). Both files are supposed to be provided
       by the library package and should thus be available as
       /usr/local/var/lib/dpkg/info/<i>package</i>.<i>symbols</i> or
       /usr/local/var/lib/dpkg/info/<i>package</i>.<i>shlibs</i>. The package name is
       identified in two steps: find the library file on the system
       (looking in the same directories that <b>ld.so </b>would use), then use
       <b>dpkg -S </b><i>library-file</i> to lookup the package providing the library.

   <b>Symbols files</b>
       Symbols files contain finer-grained dependency information by
       providing the minimum dependency for each symbol that the library
       exports. The script tries to find a symbols file associated to a
       library package in the following places (first match is used):

       debian/*/DEBIAN/symbols
              Shared library information generated by the current build
              process that also invoked <b>dpkg-shlibdeps</b>.  They are
              generated by <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dpkg-gensymbols.1.html">dpkg-gensymbols(1)</a>.  They are only used if
              the library is found in a package's build tree. The
              symbols file in that build tree takes precedence over
              symbols files from other binary packages.

       /usr/local/etc/dpkg/symbols/<i>package</i>.symbols.<i>arch</i>

       /usr/local/etc/dpkg/symbols/<i>package</i>.symbols
              Per-system overriding shared library dependency
              information.  <i>arch</i> is the architecture of the current
              system (obtained by <b>dpkg-architecture -qDEB_HOST_ARCH</b>).

       Output from “<b>dpkg-query --control-path </b><i>package</i> symbols”
              Package-provided shared library dependency information.
              Unless overridden by <b>--admindir</b>, those files are located
              in /usr/local/var/lib/dpkg.

       While scanning the symbols used by all binaries, <b>dpkg-shlibdeps</b>
       remembers the (biggest) minimal version needed for each library.
       At the end of the process, it is able to write out the minimal
       dependency for every library used (provided that the information
       of the <i>symbols</i> files are accurate).

       As a safe-guard measure, a symbols file can provide a
       <b>Build-Depends-Package </b>meta-information field and <b>dpkg-shlibdeps</b>
       will extract the minimal version required by the corresponding
       package in the <b>Build-Depends </b>field and use this version if it's
       higher than the minimal version computed by scanning symbols.

   <b>Shlibs files</b>
       Shlibs files associate directly a library to a dependency
       (without looking at the symbols). It's thus often stronger than
       really needed but very safe and easy to handle.

       The dependencies for a library are looked up in several places.
       The first file providing information for the library of interest
       is used:

       debian/shlibs.local
              Package-local overriding shared library dependency
              information.

       /usr/local/etc/dpkg/shlibs.override
              Per-system overriding shared library dependency
              information.

       debian/*/DEBIAN/shlibs
              Shared library information generated by the current build
              process that also invoked <b>dpkg-shlibdeps</b>.  They are only
              used if the library is found in a package's build tree.
              The shlibs file in that build tree takes precedence over
              shlibs files from other binary packages.

       Output from “<b>dpkg-query --control-path </b><i>package</i> shlibs”
              Package-provided shared library dependency information.
              Unless overridden by <b>--admindir</b>, those files are located
              in /usr/local/var/lib/dpkg.

       /usr/local/etc/dpkg/shlibs.default
              Per-system default shared library dependency information.

       The extracted dependencies are then directly used (except if they
       are filtered out because they have been identified as duplicate,
       or as weaker than another dependency).
