       vgremove removes one or more VGs. If LVs exist in the VG, a
       prompt is used to confirm LV removal.

       If one or more PVs in the VG are lost, consider <b>vgreduce</b>
       <b>--removemissing </b>to make the VG metadata consistent again.

       Repeat the force option (<b>-ff</b>) to forcibly remove LVs in the VG
       without confirmation.
