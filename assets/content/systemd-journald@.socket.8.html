       systemd-journald is a system service that collects and stores
       logging data. It creates and maintains structured, indexed
       journals based on logging information that is received from a
       variety of sources:

       •   Kernel log messages, via kmsg

       •   Simple system log messages, via the libc <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/syslog.3.html">syslog(3)</a> call

       •   Structured system log messages via the native Journal API,
           see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/sd_journal_print.3.html">sd_journal_print(3)</a> and <b>Native Journal Protocol</b><b></b>[1]

       •   Standard output and standard error of service units. For
           further details see below.

       •   Audit records, originating from the kernel audit subsystem

       The daemon will implicitly collect numerous metadata fields for
       each log messages in a secure and unfakeable way. See
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/systemd.journal-fields.7.html">systemd.journal-fields(7)</a> for more information about the
       collected metadata.

       Log data collected by the journal is primarily text-based but can
       also include binary data where necessary. Individual fields
       making up a log record stored in the journal may be up to 2^64-1
       bytes in size.

       The journal service stores log data either persistently below
       /var/log/journal or in a volatile way below /run/log/journal/ (in
       the latter case it is lost at reboot). By default, log data is
       stored persistently if /var/log/journal/ exists during boot, with
       an implicit fallback to volatile storage otherwise. Use <i>Storage=</i>
       in <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/journald.conf.5.html">journald.conf(5)</a> to configure where log data is placed,
       independently of the existence of /var/log/journal/.

       Note that journald will initially use volatile storage, until a
       call to <b>journalctl --flush </b>(or sending <b>SIGUSR1 </b>to journald) will
       cause it to switch to persistent logging (under the conditions
       mentioned above). This is done automatically on boot via
       "systemd-journal-flush.service".

       On systems where /var/log/journal/ does not exist yet but where
       persistent logging is desired (and the default journald.conf is
       used), it is sufficient to create the directory, and ensure it
       has the correct access modes and ownership:

           mkdir -p /var/log/journal
           systemd-tmpfiles --create --prefix /var/log/journal

       See <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/journald.conf.5.html">journald.conf(5)</a> for information about the configuration of
       this service.
