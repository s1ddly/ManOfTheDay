       <b>lxc-user-nic </b>is a setuid-root program with which unprivileged
       users may manage network interfaces for use by a lxc container.

       It will consult the configuration file <i>/usr/local/etc/lxc/lxc-</i>
       <i>usernet</i> to determine the number of interfaces which the calling
       user is allowed to create, and which bridge they may attach them
       to. It tracks the number of interfaces each user has created
       using the file <i>/run/lxc/nics</i>. It ensures that the calling user is
       privileged over the network namespace to which the interface will
       be attached.  <b>lxc-user-nic </b>also allows one to delete network
       devices.  Currently only ovs ports can be deleted.
