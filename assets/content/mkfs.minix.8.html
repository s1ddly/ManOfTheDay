       <b>mkfs.minix </b>creates a Linux MINIX filesystem on a device (usually
       a disk partition).

       The <i>device</i> is usually of the following form:

           /dev/hda[1-8] (IDE disk 1)
           /dev/hdb[1-8] (IDE disk 2)
           /dev/sda[1-8] (SCSI disk 1)
           /dev/sdb[1-8] (SCSI disk 2)

       The device may be a block device or an image file of one, but
       this is not enforced. Expect not much fun on a character device
       :-).

       The <i>size-in-blocks</i> parameter is the desired size of the file
       system, in blocks. It is present only for backwards
       compatibility. If omitted the size will be determined
       automatically. Only block counts strictly greater than 10 and
       strictly less than 65536 are allowed.
