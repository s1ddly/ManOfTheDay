<pre>
       Change the group of each FILE to GROUP.  With <b>--reference</b>, change
       the group of each FILE to that of RFILE.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--changes</b>
              like verbose but report only when a change is made

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--silent</b>, <b>--quiet</b>
              suppress most error messages

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              output a diagnostic for every file processed

       <b>--dereference</b>
              affect the referent of each symbolic link (this is the
              default), rather than the symbolic link itself

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--no-dereference</b>
              affect symbolic links instead of any referenced file
              (useful only on systems that can change the ownership of a
              symlink)

       <b>--no-preserve-root</b>
              do not treat '/' specially (the default)

       <b>--preserve-root</b>
              fail to operate recursively on '/'

       <b>--reference</b>=<i>RFILE</i>
              use RFILE's group rather than specifying a GROUP value

       <b>-R</b>, <b>--recursive</b>
              operate on files and directories recursively

       The following options modify how a hierarchy is traversed when
       the <b>-R </b>option is also specified.  If more than one is specified,
       only the final one takes effect.

       <b>-H     </b>if a command line argument is a symbolic link to a
              directory, traverse it

       <b>-L     </b>traverse every symbolic link to a directory encountered

       <b>-P     </b>do not traverse any symbolic links (default)

       <b>--help </b>display this help and exit

       <b>--version</b>
              output version information and exit
