       <b>lexgrog </b>is an implementation of the traditional “groff guess”
       utility in <b>lex</b>.  It reads the list of files on its command line
       as either man page source files or preformatted “cat” pages, and
       displays their name and description as used by <b>apropos </b>and
       <b>whatis</b>, the list of preprocessing filters required by the man
       page before it is passed to <b>nroff </b>or <b>troff</b>, or both.

       If its input is badly formatted, <b>lexgrog </b>will print “parse
       failed”; this may be useful for external programs that need to
       check man pages for correctness.  If one of <b>lexgrog</b>'s input files
       is “-”, it will read from standard input; if any input file is
       compressed, a decompressed version will be read automatically.
