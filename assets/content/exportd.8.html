       The <b>nfsv4.exportd </b>is used to manage NFSv4 exports.  The NFS
       server (<i>nfsd</i>) maintains a cache of authentication and
       authorization information which is used to identify the source of
       each request, and then what access permissions that source has to
       any local filesystem.  When required information is not found in
       the cache, the server sends a request to <b>nfsv4.exportd </b>to fill in
       the missing information.  <b>nfsv4.exportd </b>uses a table of
       information stored in <b>/var/lib/nfs/etab </b>and maintained by
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/exportfs.8.html">exportfs(8)</a>, possibly based on the contents of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/exports.5.html">exports(5)</a>, to
       respond to each request.
