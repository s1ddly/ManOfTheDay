       The <b>tapestat </b>command is used for monitoring the activity of tape
       drives connected to a system.

       The first report generated by the <b>tapestat </b>command provides
       statistics concerning the time since the system was booted,
       unless the <b>-y </b>option is used, when this first report is omitted.
       Each subsequent report covers the time since the previous report.

       The <i>interval</i> parameter specifies the amount of time in seconds
       between each report. The <i>count</i> parameter can be specified in
       conjunction with the <i>interval</i> parameter. If the <i>count</i> parameter
       is specified, the value of <i>count</i> determines the number of reports
       generated at <i>interval</i> seconds apart. If the <i>interval</i> parameter is
       specified without the <i>count</i> parameter, the <b>tapestat </b>command
       generates reports continuously.
