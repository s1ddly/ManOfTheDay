       The Kernel Lockdown feature is designed to prevent both direct
       and indirect access to a running kernel image, attempting to
       protect against unauthorized modification of the kernel image and
       to prevent access to security and cryptographic data located in
       kernel memory, whilst still permitting driver modules to be
       loaded.

       If a prohibited or restricted feature is accessed or used, the
       kernel will emit a message that looks like:

               Lockdown: X: Y is restricted, see man kernel_lockdown.7

       where X indicates the process name and Y indicates what is
       restricted.

       On an EFI-enabled x86 or arm64 machine, lockdown will be
       automatically enabled if the system boots in EFI Secure Boot
       mode.

   <b>Coverage</b>
       When lockdown is in effect, a number of features are disabled or
       have their use restricted.  This includes special device files
       and kernel services that allow direct access of the kernel image:

              /dev/mem
              /dev/kmem
              /dev/kcore
              /dev/ioports
              BPF
              kprobes

       and the ability to directly configure and control devices, so as
       to prevent the use of a device to access or modify a kernel
       image:

       • The use of module parameters that directly specify hardware
         parameters to drivers through the kernel command line or when
         loading a module.

       • The use of direct PCI BAR access.

       • The use of the ioperm and iopl instructions on x86.

       • The use of the KD*IO console ioctls.

       • The use of the TIOCSSERIAL serial ioctl.

       • The alteration of MSR registers on x86.

       • The replacement of the PCMCIA CIS.

       • The overriding of ACPI tables.

       • The use of ACPI error injection.

       • The specification of the ACPI RDSP address.

       • The use of ACPI custom methods.

       Certain facilities are restricted:

       • Only validly signed modules may be loaded (waived if the module
         file being loaded is vouched for by IMA appraisal).

       • Only validly signed binaries may be kexec'd (waived if the
         binary image file to be executed is vouched for by IMA
         appraisal).

       • Unencrypted hibernation/suspend to swap are disallowed as the
         kernel image is saved to a medium that can then be accessed.

       • Use of debugfs is not permitted as this allows a whole range of
         actions including direct configuration of, access to and
         driving of hardware.

       • IMA requires the addition of the "secure_boot" rules to the
         policy, whether or not they are specified on the command line,
         for both the built-in and custom policies in secure boot
         lockdown mode.
