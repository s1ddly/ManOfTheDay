       The <b>localedef </b>program reads the indicated <i>charmap</i> and <i>input</i>
       files, compiles them to a binary form quickly usable by the
       locale functions in the C library (<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/setlocale.3.html">setlocale(3)</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/localeconv.3.html">localeconv(3)</a>,
       etc.), and places the output in <i>outputpath</i>.

       The <i>outputpath</i> argument is interpreted as follows:

       *  If <i>outputpath</i> contains a slash character ('/'), it is
          interpreted as the name of the directory where the output
          definitions are to be stored.  In this case, there is a
          separate output file for each locale category (<i>LC_TIME</i>,
          <i>LC_NUMERIC</i>, and so on).

       *  If the <b>--no-archive </b>option is used, <i>outputpath</i> is the name of
          a subdirectory in <i>/usr/lib/locale</i> where per-category compiled
          files are placed.

       *  Otherwise, <i>outputpath</i> is the name of a locale and the compiled
          locale data is added to the archive file
          <i>/usr/lib/locale/locale-archive</i>.  A locale archive is a memory-
          mapped file which contains all the system-provided locales; it
          is used by all localized programs when the environment
          variable <b>LOCPATH </b>is not set.

       In any case, <b>localedef </b>aborts if the directory in which it tries
       to write locale files has not already been created.

       If no <i>charmapfile</i> is given, the value <i>ANSI_X3.4-1968</i> (for ASCII)
       is used by default.  If no <i>inputfile</i> is given, or if it is given
       as a dash (-), <b>localedef </b>reads from standard input.
