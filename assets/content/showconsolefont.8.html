       The <b>showconsolefont </b>command outputs the current console font to
       stdout. The option <b>-v </b>prints additional information, while the
       option <b>-V </b>prints the program version number. The option <b>-i</b>
       doesn't print out the font table, just shows ROWSxCOLSxCOUNT and
       exits.  On Linux 2.6.1 and later, the option <b>-C </b>allows one to
       indicate the console involved. Its argument is a pathname.
