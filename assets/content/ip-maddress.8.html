       <b>maddress </b>objects are multicast addresses.

   <b>ip maddress show - list multicast addresses</b>
       <b>dev </b><i>NAME</i> <b>(default)</b>
              the device name.

       <b>ip maddress add - add a multicast address</b>

       <b>ip maddress delete - delete a multicast address</b>

              These commands attach/detach a static link-layer multicast
              address to listen on the interface.  Note that it is
              impossible to join protocol multicast groups statically.
              This command only manages link-layer addresses.

              <b>address </b><i>LLADDRESS</i> <b>(default)</b>
                     the link-layer multicast address.

              <b>dev </b><i>NAME</i>
                     the device to join/leave this multicast address.
