       The command takes various subcommands, and different options
       depending on the subcommand:

           git bisect start [--term-{new,bad}=&lt;term&gt; --term-{old,good}=&lt;term&gt;]
                            [--no-checkout] [--first-parent] [&lt;bad&gt; [&lt;good&gt;...]] [--] [&lt;paths&gt;...]
           git bisect (bad|new|&lt;term-new&gt;) [&lt;rev&gt;]
           git bisect (good|old|&lt;term-old&gt;) [&lt;rev&gt;...]
           git bisect terms [--term-good | --term-bad]
           git bisect skip [(&lt;rev&gt;|&lt;range&gt;)...]
           git bisect reset [&lt;commit&gt;]
           git bisect (visualize|view)
           git bisect replay &lt;logfile&gt;
           git bisect log
           git bisect run &lt;cmd&gt;...
           git bisect help

       This command uses a binary search algorithm to find which commit
       in your project’s history introduced a bug. You use it by first
       telling it a "bad" commit that is known to contain the bug, and a
       "good" commit that is known to be before the bug was introduced.
       Then <b>git bisect </b>picks a commit between those two endpoints and
       asks you whether the selected commit is "good" or "bad". It
       continues narrowing down the range until it finds the exact
       commit that introduced the change.

       In fact, <b>git bisect </b>can be used to find the commit that changed
       <b>any </b>property of your project; e.g., the commit that fixed a bug,
       or the commit that caused a benchmark’s performance to improve.
       To support this more general usage, the terms "old" and "new" can
       be used in place of "good" and "bad", or you can choose your own
       terms. See section "Alternate terms" below for more information.

   <b>Basic bisect commands: start, bad, good</b>
       As an example, suppose you are trying to find the commit that
       broke a feature that was known to work in version <b>v2.6.13-rc2 </b>of
       your project. You start a bisect session as follows:

           $ git bisect start
           $ git bisect bad                 # Current version is bad
           $ git bisect good v2.6.13-rc2    # v2.6.13-rc2 is known to be good

       Once you have specified at least one bad and one good commit, <b>git</b>
       <b>bisect </b>selects a commit in the middle of that range of history,
       checks it out, and outputs something similar to the following:

           Bisecting: 675 revisions left to test after this (roughly 10 steps)

       You should now compile the checked-out version and test it. If
       that version works correctly, type

           $ git bisect good

       If that version is broken, type

           $ git bisect bad

       Then <b>git bisect </b>will respond with something like

           Bisecting: 337 revisions left to test after this (roughly 9 steps)

       Keep repeating the process: compile the tree, test it, and
       depending on whether it is good or bad run <b>git bisect good </b>or <b>git</b>
       <b>bisect bad </b>to ask for the next commit that needs testing.

       Eventually there will be no more revisions left to inspect, and
       the command will print out a description of the first bad commit.
       The reference <b>refs/bisect/bad </b>will be left pointing at that
       commit.

   <b>Bisect reset</b>
       After a bisect session, to clean up the bisection state and
       return to the original HEAD, issue the following command:

           $ git bisect reset

       By default, this will return your tree to the commit that was
       checked out before <b>git bisect start</b>. (A new <b>git bisect start </b>will
       also do that, as it cleans up the old bisection state.)

       With an optional argument, you can return to a different commit
       instead:

           $ git bisect reset &lt;commit&gt;

       For example, <b>git bisect reset bisect/bad </b>will check out the first
       bad revision, while <b>git bisect reset HEAD </b>will leave you on the
       current bisection commit and avoid switching commits at all.

   <b>Alternate terms</b>
       Sometimes you are not looking for the commit that introduced a
       breakage, but rather for a commit that caused a change between
       some other "old" state and "new" state. For example, you might be
       looking for the commit that introduced a particular fix. Or you
       might be looking for the first commit in which the source-code
       filenames were finally all converted to your company’s naming
       standard. Or whatever.

       In such cases it can be very confusing to use the terms "good"
       and "bad" to refer to "the state before the change" and "the
       state after the change". So instead, you can use the terms "old"
       and "new", respectively, in place of "good" and "bad". (But note
       that you cannot mix "good" and "bad" with "old" and "new" in a
       single session.)

       In this more general usage, you provide <b>git bisect </b>with a "new"
       commit that has some property and an "old" commit that doesn’t
       have that property. Each time <b>git bisect </b>checks out a commit, you
       test if that commit has the property. If it does, mark the commit
       as "new"; otherwise, mark it as "old". When the bisection is
       done, <b>git bisect </b>will report which commit introduced the
       property.

       To use "old" and "new" instead of "good" and bad, you must run
       <b>git bisect start </b>without commits as argument and then run the
       following commands to add the commits:

           git bisect old [&lt;rev&gt;]

       to indicate that a commit was before the sought change, or

           git bisect new [&lt;rev&gt;...]

       to indicate that it was after.

       To get a reminder of the currently used terms, use

           git bisect terms

       You can get just the old (respectively new) term with <b>git bisect</b>
       <b>terms --term-old </b>or <b>git bisect terms --term-good</b>.

       If you would like to use your own terms instead of "bad"/"good"
       or "new"/"old", you can choose any names you like (except
       existing bisect subcommands like <b>reset</b>, <b>start</b>, ...) by starting
       the bisection using

           git bisect start --term-old &lt;term-old&gt; --term-new &lt;term-new&gt;

       For example, if you are looking for a commit that introduced a
       performance regression, you might use

           git bisect start --term-old fast --term-new slow

       Or if you are looking for the commit that fixed a bug, you might
       use

           git bisect start --term-new fixed --term-old broken

       Then, use <b>git bisect &lt;term-old&gt; </b>and <b>git bisect &lt;term-new&gt; </b>instead
       of <b>git bisect good </b>and <b>git bisect bad </b>to mark commits.

   <b>Bisect visualize/view</b>
       To see the currently remaining suspects in <i>gitk</i>, issue the
       following command during the bisection process (the subcommand
       <b>view </b>can be used as an alternative to <b>visualize</b>):

           $ git bisect visualize

       If the <b>DISPLAY </b>environment variable is not set, <i>git log</i> is used
       instead. You can also give command-line options such as <b>-p </b>and
       <b>--stat</b>.

           $ git bisect visualize --stat

   <b>Bisect log and bisect replay</b>
       After having marked revisions as good or bad, issue the following
       command to show what has been done so far:

           $ git bisect log

       If you discover that you made a mistake in specifying the status
       of a revision, you can save the output of this command to a file,
       edit it to remove the incorrect entries, and then issue the
       following commands to return to a corrected state:

           $ git bisect reset
           $ git bisect replay that-file

   <b>Avoiding testing a commit</b>
       If, in the middle of a bisect session, you know that the
       suggested revision is not a good one to test (e.g. it fails to
       build and you know that the failure does not have anything to do
       with the bug you are chasing), you can manually select a nearby
       commit and test that one instead.

       For example:

           $ git bisect good/bad                   # previous round was good or bad.
           Bisecting: 337 revisions left to test after this (roughly 9 steps)
           $ git bisect visualize                  # oops, that is uninteresting.
           $ git reset --hard HEAD~3               # try 3 revisions before what
                                                   # was suggested

       Then compile and test the chosen revision, and afterwards mark
       the revision as good or bad in the usual manner.

   <b>Bisect skip</b>
       Instead of choosing a nearby commit by yourself, you can ask Git
       to do it for you by issuing the command:

           $ git bisect skip                 # Current version cannot be tested

       However, if you skip a commit adjacent to the one you are looking
       for, Git will be unable to tell exactly which of those commits
       was the first bad one.

       You can also skip a range of commits, instead of just one commit,
       using range notation. For example:

           $ git bisect skip v2.5..v2.6

       This tells the bisect process that no commit after <b>v2.5</b>, up to
       and including <b>v2.6</b>, should be tested.

       Note that if you also want to skip the first commit of the range
       you would issue the command:

           $ git bisect skip v2.5 v2.5..v2.6

       This tells the bisect process that the commits between <b>v2.5 </b>and
       <b>v2.6 </b>(inclusive) should be skipped.

   <b>Cutting down bisection by giving more parameters to bisect start</b>
       You can further cut down the number of trials, if you know what
       part of the tree is involved in the problem you are tracking
       down, by specifying path parameters when issuing the <b>bisect start</b>
       command:

           $ git bisect start -- arch/i386 include/asm-i386

       If you know beforehand more than one good commit, you can narrow
       the bisect space down by specifying all of the good commits
       immediately after the bad commit when issuing the <b>bisect start</b>
       command:

           $ git bisect start v2.6.20-rc6 v2.6.20-rc4 v2.6.20-rc1 --
                              # v2.6.20-rc6 is bad
                              # v2.6.20-rc4 and v2.6.20-rc1 are good

   <b>Bisect run</b>
       If you have a script that can tell if the current source code is
       good or bad, you can bisect by issuing the command:

           $ git bisect run my_script arguments

       Note that the script (<b>my_script </b>in the above example) should exit
       with code 0 if the current source code is good/old, and exit with
       a code between 1 and 127 (inclusive), except 125, if the current
       source code is bad/new.

       Any other exit code will abort the bisect process. It should be
       noted that a program that terminates via <b>exit(-1) </b>leaves $? =
       255, (see the exit(3) manual page), as the value is chopped with
       <b>&amp; 0377</b>.

       The special exit code 125 should be used when the current source
       code cannot be tested. If the script exits with this code, the
       current revision will be skipped (see <b>git bisect skip </b>above). 125
       was chosen as the highest sensible value to use for this purpose,
       because 126 and 127 are used by POSIX shells to signal specific
       error status (127 is for command not found, 126 is for command
       found but not executable—these details do not matter, as they are
       normal errors in the script, as far as <b>bisect run </b>is concerned).

       You may often find that during a bisect session you want to have
       temporary modifications (e.g. s/#define DEBUG 0/#define DEBUG 1/
       in a header file, or "revision that does not have this commit
       needs this patch applied to work around another problem this
       bisection is not interested in") applied to the revision being
       tested.

       To cope with such a situation, after the inner <i>git bisect</i> finds
       the next revision to test, the script can apply the patch before
       compiling, run the real test, and afterwards decide if the
       revision (possibly with the needed patch) passed the test and
       then rewind the tree to the pristine state. Finally the script
       should exit with the status of the real test to let the <b>git</b>
       <b>bisect run </b>command loop determine the eventual outcome of the
       bisect session.
