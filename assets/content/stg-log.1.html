       List the history of the patch stack: the stack log. If one or
       more patch names are given, limit the list to the log entries
       that touch the named patches.

       "stg undo" and "stg redo" let you step back and forth in the
       patch stack. "stg reset" lets you go directly to any state.

       Given the --clear option, the log history will be deleted. This
       may be useful if the tree view has become too cluttered to be
       useful.
