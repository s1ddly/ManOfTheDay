       <b>lpq </b>shows the current print queue status on the named printer.
       Jobs queued on the default destination will be shown if no
       printer or class is specified on the command-line.

       The <i>+interval</i> option allows you to continuously report the jobs
       in the queue until the queue is empty; the list of jobs is shown
       once every <i>interval</i> seconds.
