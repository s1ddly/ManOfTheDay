       GNU <b>tar </b>is an archiving program designed to store multiple files
       in a single file (an <b>archive</b>), and to manipulate such archives.
       The archive can be either a regular file or a device (e.g. a tape
       drive, hence the name of the program, which stands for <b>t</b>ape
       <b>ar</b>chiver), which can be located either on the local or on a
       remote machine.

   <b>Option styles</b>
       Options to GNU <b>tar </b>can be given in three different styles.  In
       <b>traditional style</b>, the first argument is a cluster of option
       letters and all subsequent arguments supply arguments to those
       options that require them.  The arguments are read in the same
       order as the option letters.  Any command line words that remain
       after all options has been processed are treated as non-optional
       arguments: file or archive member names.

       For example, the <b>c </b>option requires creating the archive, the <b>v</b>
       option requests the verbose operation, and the <b>f </b>option takes an
       argument that sets the name of the archive to operate upon.  The
       following command, written in the traditional style, instructs
       tar to store all files from the directory <b>/etc </b>into the archive
       file <b>etc.tar </b>verbosely listing the files being archived:

       tar cfv etc.tar /etc

       In <b>UNIX </b>or <b>short-option style</b>, each option letter is prefixed
       with a single dash, as in other command line utilities.  If an
       option takes argument, the argument follows it, either as a
       separate command line word, or immediately following the option.
       However, if the option takes an <b>optional </b>argument, the argument
       must follow the option letter without any intervening whitespace,
       as in <b>-g/tmp/snar.db</b>.

       Any number of options not taking arguments can be clustered
       together after a single dash, e.g. <b>-vkp</b>.  Options that take
       arguments (whether mandatory or optional), can appear at the end
       of such a cluster, e.g. <b>-vkpf a.tar</b>.

       The example command above written in the <b>short-option style </b>could
       look like:

       tar -cvf etc.tar /etc
       or
       tar -c -v -f etc.tar /etc

       In <b>GNU </b>or <b>long-option style</b>, each option begins with two dashes
       and has a meaningful name, consisting of lower-case letters and
       dashes.  When used, the long option can be abbreviated to its
       initial letters, provided that this does not create ambiguity.
       Arguments to long options are supplied either as a separate
       command line word, immediately following the option, or separated
       from the option by an equals sign with no intervening whitespace.
       Optional arguments must always use the latter method.

       Here are several ways of writing the example command in this
       style:

       tar --create --file etc.tar --verbose /etc
       or (abbreviating some options):
       tar --cre --file=etc.tar --verb /etc

       The options in all three styles can be intermixed, although doing
       so with old options is not encouraged.

   <b>Operation mode</b>
       The options listed in the table below tell GNU <b>tar </b>what operation
       it is to perform.  Exactly one of them must be given.  Meaning of
       non-optional arguments depends on the operation mode requested.

       <b>-A</b>, <b>--catenate</b>, <b>--concatenate</b>
              Append archive to the end of another archive.  The
              arguments are treated as the names of archives to append.
              All archives must be of the same format as the archive
              they are appended to, otherwise the resulting archive
              might be unusable with non-GNU implementations of <b>tar</b>.
              Notice also that when more than one archive is given, the
              members from archives other than the first one will be
              accessible in the resulting archive only if using the <b>-i</b>
              (<b>--ignore-zeros</b>) option.

              Compressed archives cannot be concatenated.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--create</b>
              Create a new archive.  Arguments supply the names of the
              files to be archived.  Directories are archived
              recursively, unless the <b>--no-recursion </b>option is given.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--diff</b>, <b>--compare</b>
              Find differences between archive and file system.  The
              arguments are optional and specify archive members to
              compare.  If not given, the current working directory is
              assumed.

       <b>--delete</b>
              Delete from the archive.  The arguments supply names of
              the archive members to be removed.  At least one argument
              must be given.

              This option does not operate on compressed archives.
              There is no short option equivalent.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--append</b>
              Append files to the end of an archive.  Arguments have the
              same meaning as for <b>-c </b>(<b>--create</b>).

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--list</b>
              List the contents of an archive.  Arguments are optional.
              When given, they specify the names of the members to list.

       <b>--test-label</b>
              Test the archive volume label and exit.  When used without
              arguments, it prints the volume label (if any) and exits
              with status <b>0</b>.  When one or more command line arguments
              are given.  <b>tar </b>compares the volume label with each
              argument.  It exits with code <b>0 </b>if a match is found, and
              with code <b>1 </b>otherwise.  No output is displayed, unless
              used together with the <b>-v </b>(<b>--verbose</b>) option.

              There is no short option equivalent for this option.

       <b>-u</b>, <b>--update</b>
              Append files which are newer than the corresponding copy
              in the archive.  Arguments have the same meaning as with
              <b>-c </b>and <b>-r </b>options.  Notice, that newer files don't replace
              their old archive copies, but instead are appended to the
              end of archive.  The resulting archive can thus contain
              several members of the same name, corresponding to various
              versions of the same file.

       <b>-x</b>, <b>--extract</b>, <b>--get</b>
              Extract files from an archive.  Arguments are optional.
              When given, they specify names of the archive members to
              be extracted.

       <b>--show-defaults</b>
              Show built-in defaults for various <b>tar </b>options and exit.
              No arguments are allowed.

       <b>-?</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Display a short option summary and exit.  No arguments
              allowed.

       <b>--usage</b>
              Display a list of available options and exit.  No
              arguments allowed.

       <b>--version</b>
              Print program version and copyright information and exit.
