       <b>Hostname </b>is the program that is used to either set or display the
       current host, domain or node name of the system.  These names are
       used by many of the networking programs to identify the machine.
       The domain name is also used by NIS/YP.

   <b>GET NAME</b>
       When called without any arguments, the program displays the
       current names:

       <b>hostname </b>will print the name of the system as returned by the
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/gethostname.2.html">gethostname(2)</a> function.

       <b>domainname, nisdomainname, ypdomainname </b>will print the name of
       the system as returned by the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getdomainname.2.html">getdomainname(2)</a> function. This is
       also known as the YP/NIS domain name of the system.

       <b>nodename </b>will print the DECnet node name of the system as
       returned by the <b>getnodename</b>(2) function.

       <b>dnsdomainname </b>will print the domain part of the FQDN (Fully
       Qualified Domain Name). The complete FQDN of the system is
       returned with <b>hostname --fqdn</b>.

   <b>SET NAME</b>
       When called with one argument or with the <b>--file </b>option, the
       commands set the host name, the NIS/YP domain name or the node
       name.

       Note, that only the super-user can change the names.

       It is not possible to set the FQDN or the DNS domain name with
       the <b>dnsdomainname </b>command (see <b>THE FQDN </b>below).

       The host name is usually set once at system startup by reading
       the contents of a file which contains the host name, e.g.
       <i>/etc/hostname</i>).

   <b>THE FQDN</b>
       You can't change the FQDN (as returned by <b>hostname --fqdn</b>) or the
       DNS domain name (as returned by <b>dnsdomainname</b>) with this command.
       The FQDN of the system is the name that the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/resolver.3.html">resolver(3)</a> returns
       for the host name.

       Technically: The FQDN is the canonical name returned by
       <b>gethostbyname2</b>(2) when resolving the result of the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/gethostname.2.html">gethostname(2)</a>
       name. The DNS domain name is the part after the first dot.

       Therefore it depends on the configuration (usually in
       <i>/etc/host.conf</i>) how you can change it. If <b>hosts </b>is the first
       lookup method, you can change the FQDN in <i>/etc/hosts</i>.
