       <b>pmlogrewrite </b>reads a set of Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) archive
       logs identified by <i>inlog</i> and creates a PCP archive log in <i>outlog</i>.
       Under normal usage, the <b>-c </b>option will be used to nominate a
       configuration file or files that contains specifications (see the
       <b>REWRITING RULES SYNTAX </b>section below) that describe how the data
       and metadata from <i>inlog</i> should be transformed to produce <i>outlog</i>.

       The typical uses for <b>pmlogrewrite </b>would be to accommodate the
       evolution of Performance Metric Domain Agents (PMDAs) where the
       names, metadata and semantics of metrics and their associated
       instance domains may change over time, e.g. promoting the type of
       a metric from a 32-bit to a 64-bit integer, or renaming a group
       of metrics.  Refer to the <b>EXAMPLES </b>section for some additional
       use cases.

       <b>pmlogrewrite </b>is most useful where PMDA changes, or errors in the
       production environment, result in archives that cannot be
       combined with <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmlogextract.1.html">pmlogextract(1)</a>.  By pre-processing the archives
       with <b>pmlogrewrite </b>the resulting archives may be able to be merged
       with <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmlogextract.1.html">pmlogextract(1)</a>.

       The input <i>inlog</i> must be a set of PCP archive logs created by
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a>, or possibly one of the tools that read and create
       PCP archives, e.g.  <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmlogextract.1.html">pmlogextract(1)</a> and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmlogreduce.1.html">pmlogreduce(1)</a>.  <i>inlog</i> is
       a comma-separated list of names, each of which may be the base
       name of an archive or the name of a directory containing one or
       more archives.

       If no <b>-c </b>option is specified, then the default behavior simply
       creates <i>outlog</i> as a copy of <i>inlog</i>.  This is a little more
       complicated than <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/cat.1.html">cat(1)</a>, as each PCP archive is made up of
       several physical files.

       While <b>pmlogrewrite </b>may be used to repair some data consistency
       issues in PCP archives, there is also a class of repair tasks
       that cannot be handled by <b>pmlogrewrite </b>and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmloglabel.1.html">pmloglabel(1)</a> may be a
       useful tool in these cases.
