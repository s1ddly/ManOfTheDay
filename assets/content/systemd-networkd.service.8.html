       <b>systemd-networkd </b>is a system service that manages networks. It
       detects and configures network devices as they appear, as well as
       creating virtual network devices.

       To configure low-level link settings independently of networks,
       see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/systemd.link.5.html">systemd.link(5)</a>.

       <b>systemd-networkd </b>will create network devices based on the
       configuration in <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/systemd.netdev.5.html">systemd.netdev(5)</a> files, respecting the [Match]
       sections in those files.

       <b>systemd-networkd </b>will manage network addresses and routes for any
       link for which it finds a .network file with an appropriate
       [Match] section, see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/systemd.network.5.html">systemd.network(5)</a>. For those links, it will
       flush existing network addresses and routes when bringing up the
       device. Any links not matched by one of the .network files will
       be ignored. It is also possible to explicitly tell
       systemd-networkd to ignore a link by using <i>Unmanaged=yes</i> option,
       see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/systemd.network.5.html">systemd.network(5)</a>.

       When systemd-networkd exits, it generally leaves existing network
       devices and configuration intact. This makes it possible to
       transition from the initramfs and to restart the service without
       breaking connectivity. This also means that when configuration is
       updated and systemd-networkd is restarted, netdev interfaces for
       which configuration was removed will not be dropped, and may need
       to be cleaned up manually.

       <b>systemd-networkd </b>may be introspected and controlled at runtime
       using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/networkctl.1.html">networkctl(1)</a>.
