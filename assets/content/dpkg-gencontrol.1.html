       <b>dpkg-gencontrol </b>reads information from an unpacked Debian source
       tree and generates a binary package control file (which defaults
       to debian/tmp/DEBIAN/control); during this process it will
       simplify the relation fields.

       Thus <b>Pre-Depends</b>, <b>Depends</b>, <b>Recommends </b>and <b>Suggests </b>are simplified
       in this order by removing dependencies which are known to be true
       according to the stronger dependencies already parsed. It will
       also remove any self-dependency (in fact it will remove any
       dependency which evaluates to true given the current version of
       the package as installed). Logically it keeps the intersection of
       multiple dependencies on the same package. The order of
       dependencies is preserved as best as possible: if any dependency
       must be discarded due to another dependency appearing further in
       the field, the superseding dependency will take the place of the
       discarded one.

       The other relation fields (<b>Enhances</b>, <b>Conflicts</b>, <b>Breaks</b>, <b>Replaces</b>
       and <b>Provides</b>) are also simplified individually by computing the
       union of the various dependencies when a package is listed
       multiple times in the field.

       <b>dpkg-gencontrol </b>also adds an entry for the binary package to
       <b>debian/files</b>.
