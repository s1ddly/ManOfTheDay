       <b>elfedit </b>updates the ELF header and program property of ELF files
       which have the matching ELF machine and file types.  The options
       control how and which fields in the ELF header and program
       property should be updated.

       <i>elffile</i>... are the ELF files to be updated.  32-bit and 64-bit
       ELF files are supported, as are archives containing ELF files.
