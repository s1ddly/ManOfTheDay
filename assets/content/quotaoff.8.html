   <b>quotaon</b>
       <b>quotaon </b>announces to the system that disk quotas should be
       enabled on one or more filesystems. The filesystem quota files
       must be present in the root directory of the specified filesystem
       and be named either <i>aquota.user</i> (for version 2 user quota),
       <i>quota.user</i> (for version 1 user quota), <i>aquota.group</i> (for version
       2 group quota), or <i>quota.group</i> (for version 1 group quota).

       XFS filesystems are a special case - XFS considers quota
       information as filesystem metadata and uses journaling to provide
       a higher level guarantee of consistency.  There are two
       components to the XFS disk quota system: accounting and limit
       enforcement.  XFS filesystems require that quota accounting be
       turned on at mount time.  It is possible to enable and disable
       limit enforcement on an XFS filesystem after quota accounting is
       already turned on.  The default is to turn on both accounting and
       enforcement.

       The XFS quota implementation does not maintain quota information
       in user-visible files, but rather stores this information
       internally.

       <b>quotaoff </b>announces to the system that the specified filesystems
       should have any disk quotas turned off.
