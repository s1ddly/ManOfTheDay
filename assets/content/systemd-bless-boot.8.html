       systemd-bless-boot.service is a system service that marks the
       current boot process as successful. It's automatically pulled
       into the initial transaction when <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/systemd-bless-boot-generator.8.html">systemd-bless-boot-generator(8)</a>
       detects that <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/systemd-boot.7.html">systemd-boot(7)</a> style boot counting is used.

       Internally, the service operates based on the <i>LoaderBootCountPath</i>
       EFI variable (of the vendor UUID
       <b>4a67b082-0a4c-41cf-b6c7-440b29bb8c4</b>), which is passed from the
       boot loader to the OS. It contains a file system path (relative
       to the EFI system partition) of the <b>Boot Loader Specification</b><b></b>[1]
       compliant boot loader entry file or unified kernel image file
       that was used to boot up the system.  <b>systemd-bless-boot.service</b>
       removes the two 'tries done' and 'tries left' numeric boot
       counters from the filename, which indicates to future invocations
       of the boot loader that the entry has completed booting
       successfully at least once. (This service will hence rename the
       boot loader entry file or unified kernel image file on the first
       successful boot.)
