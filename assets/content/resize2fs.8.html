       The <b>resize2fs </b>program will resize ext2, ext3, or ext4 file
       systems.  It can be used to enlarge or shrink an unmounted file
       system located on <i>device</i>.  If the file system is mounted, it can
       be used to expand the size of the mounted file system, assuming
       the kernel and the file system supports on-line resizing.
       (Modern Linux 2.6 kernels will support on-line resize for file
       systems mounted using ext3 and ext4; ext3 file systems will
       require the use of file systems with the resize_inode feature
       enabled.)

       The <i>size</i> parameter specifies the requested new size of the file
       system.  If no units are specified, the units of the <i>size</i>
       parameter shall be the file system blocksize of the file system.
       Optionally, the <i>size</i> parameter may be suffixed by one of the
       following units designators: 'K', 'M', 'G', 'T' (either upper-
       case or lower-case) or 's' for power-of-two kilobytes, megabytes,
       gigabytes, terabytes or 512 byte sectors respectively. The <i>size</i>
       of the file system may never be larger than the size of the
       partition.  If <i>size</i> parameter is not specified, it will default
       to the size of the partition.

       The <b>resize2fs </b>program does not manipulate the size of partitions.
       If you wish to enlarge a file system, you must make sure you can
       expand the size of the underlying partition first.  This can be
       done using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/fdisk.8.html">fdisk(8)</a> by deleting the partition and recreating it
       with a larger size or using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/lvextend.8.html">lvextend(8)</a>, if you're using the
       logical volume manager <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/lvm.8.html">lvm(8)</a>.  When recreating the partition,
       make sure you create it with the same starting disk cylinder as
       before!  Otherwise, the resize operation will certainly not work,
       and you may lose your entire file system.  After running
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/fdisk.8.html">fdisk(8)</a>, run resize2fs to resize the ext2 file system to use all
       of the space in the newly enlarged partition.

       If you wish to shrink an ext2 partition, first use <b>resize2fs </b>to
       shrink the size of file system.  Then you may use <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/fdisk.8.html">fdisk(8)</a> to
       shrink the size of the partition.  When shrinking the size of the
       partition, make sure you do not make it smaller than the new size
       of the ext2 file system!

       The <b>-b </b>and <b>-s </b>options enable and disable the 64bit feature,
       respectively.  The resize2fs program will, of course, take care
       of resizing the block group descriptors and moving other data
       blocks out of the way, as needed.  It is not possible to resize
       the file system concurrent with changing the 64bit status.
