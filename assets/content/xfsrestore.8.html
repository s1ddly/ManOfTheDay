       <i>xfsrestore</i> restores filesystems from dumps produced by
       <i>xfsdump</i>(8).  Two modes of operation are available: simple and
       cumulative.

       The default is simple mode.  <i>xfsrestore</i> populates the specified
       destination directory, <i>dest</i>, with the files contained in the dump
       media.

       The <b>-r </b>option specifies the cumulative mode.  Successive
       invocations of <i>xfsrestore</i> are used to apply a chronologically
       ordered sequence of delta dumps to a base (level 0) dump.  The
       contents of the filesystem at the time each dump was produced is
       reproduced.  This can involve adding, deleting, renaming,
       linking, and unlinking files and directories.

       A delta dump is defined as either an incremental dump (<i>xfsdump</i> <b>-l</b>
       option with level &gt; 0) or a resumed dump (<i>xfsdump</i> <b>-R </b>option).
       The deltas must be applied in the order they were produced.  Each
       delta applied must have been produced with the previously applied
       delta as its base.

       <i>xfsrestore</i> keeps state information in the
       <i>xfsrestorehousekeepingdir</i>, to inform subsequent invocations when
       used in cumulative mode, or in the event a restore is
       interrupted.  To ensure that the state information can be
       processed, a compatible version of <i>xfsrestore</i> must be used for
       each subsequent invocation. Additionally, each invocation must
       run on a system of the same endianness and page size.

       The options to <i>xfsrestore</i> are:

       <b>-a </b><i>housekeeping</i>
            Each invocation of <i>xfsrestore</i> creates a directory called
            <i>xfsrestorehousekeepingdir</i>.  This directory is normally
            created directly under the <i>dest</i> directory.  The <b>-a </b>option
            allows the operator to specify an alternate directory,
            <i>housekeeping</i>, in which <i>xfsrestore</i> creates the
            <i>xfsrestorehousekeepingdir</i> directory.  When performing a
            cumulative (<b>-r </b>option) restore or resuming (<b>-R </b>option) a
            restore, each successive invocation must specify the same
            alternate directory.

       <b>-b </b><i>blocksize</i>
            Specifies the blocksize, in bytes, to be used for the
            restore.  For other drives such as DAT or 8 mm , the same
            blocksize used for the xfsdump operation must be specified
            to restore the tape.  The default block size is 1Mb.

       <b>-c </b><i>progname</i>
            Use the specified program to alert the operator when a media
            change is required. The alert program is typically a script
            to send a mail or flash a window to draw the operator's
            attention.

       <b>-e   </b>Prevents <i>xfsrestore</i> from overwriting existing files in the
            <i>dest</i> directory.

       <b>-f </b><i>source</i> [ <b>-f </b><i>source</i> ... ]
            Specifies a source of the dump to be restored.  This can be
            the pathname of a device (such as a tape drive), a regular
            file or a remote tape drive (see <i>rmt</i>(8)).  This option must
            be omitted if the standard input option (a lone <b>- </b>preceding
            the <i>dest</i> specification) is specified.

       <b>-i   </b>Selects interactive operation.  Once the on-media directory
            hierarchy has been read, an interactive dialogue is begun.
            The operator uses a small set of commands to peruse the
            directory hierarchy, selecting files and subtrees for
            extraction.  The available commands are given below.
            Initially nothing is selected, except for those subtrees
            specified with <b>-s </b>command line options.

            <b>ls </b>[<i>arg</i>]
                   List the entries in the current directory or the
                   specified directory, or the specified non-directory
                   file entry.  Both the entry's original inode number
                   and name are displayed.  Entries that are directories
                   are appended with a `/'.  Entries that have been
                   selected for extraction are prepended with a `*'.

            <b>cd </b>[<i>arg</i>]
                   Change the current working directory to the specified
                   argument, or to the filesystem root directory if no
                   argument is specified.

            <b>pwd    </b>Print the pathname of the current directory, relative
                   to the filesystem root.

            <b>add </b>[<i>arg</i>]
                   The current directory or specified file or directory
                   within the current directory is selected for
                   extraction.  If a directory is specified, then it and
                   all its descendents are selected.  Entries that are
                   selected for extraction are prepended with a `*' when
                   they are listed by <b>ls</b>.

            <b>delete </b>[<i>arg</i>]
                   The current directory or specified file or directory
                   within the current directory is deselected for
                   extraction.  If a directory is specified, then it and
                   all its descendents are deselected.  The most
                   expedient way to extract most of the files from a
                   directory is to select the directory and then
                   deselect those files that are not needed.

            <b>extract</b>
                   Ends the interactive dialogue, and causes all
                   selected subtrees to be restored.

            <b>quit   </b><i>xfsrestore</i> ends the interactive dialogue and
                   immediately exits, even if there are files or
                   subtrees selected for extraction.

            <b>help   </b>List a summary of the available commands.

       <b>-m   </b>Use the minimal tape protocol.  This option cannot be used
            without specifying a blocksize to be used (see <b>-b </b>option
            above).

       <b>-n </b><i>file</i>
            Allows <i>xfsrestore</i> to restore only files newer than <i>file</i>.
            The modification time of <i>file</i> (i.e., as displayed with the
            <b>ls -l </b>command) is compared to the inode modification time of
            each file on the source media (i.e., as displayed with the
            <b>ls -lc </b>command).  A file is restored from media only if its
            inode modification time is greater than or equal to the
            modification time of <i>file</i>.

       <b>-o   </b>Restore file and directory owner/group even if not root.
            When run with an effective user id of root, <i>xfsrestore</i>
            restores owner and group of each file and directory.  When
            run with any other effective user id it does not, unless
            this option is specified.

       <b>-p </b><i>interval</i>
            Causes progress reports to be printed at intervals of
            <i>interval</i> seconds.  The interval value is approximate,
            <i>xfsrestore</i> will delay progress reports to avoid undue
            processing overhead.

       <b>-q   </b>Source tape drive is a QIC tape.  QIC tapes only use a 512
            byte blocksize, for which <i>xfsrestore</i> must make special
            allowances.

       <b>-r   </b>Selects the cumulative mode of operation. The <b>-a </b>and
            <i>destination</i> options must be the same for each invocation.

       <b>-s </b><i>subtree</i>
            Specifies a subtree to restore.  Any number of <b>-s </b>options
            are allowed.  The restore is constrained to the union of all
            subtrees specified.  Each subtree is specified as a pathname
            relative to the restore <i>dest</i>.  If a directory is specified,
            the directory and all files beneath that directory are
            restored.

       <b>-t   </b>Displays the contents of the dump, but does not create or
            modify any files or directories.  It may be desirable to set
            the verbosity level to <b>silent </b>when using this option.

       <b>-v </b><i>verbosity</i>
       <b>-v </b><i>subsys</i>=<i>verbosity</i>[,<i>subsys</i>=<i>verbosity</i>,...]
            Specifies the level of detail used for messages displayed
            during the course of the restore. The <i>verbosity</i> argument can
            be passed as either a string or an integer. If passed as a
            string the following values may be used: <b>silent</b>, <b>verbose</b>,
            <b>trace</b>, <b>debug</b>, or <b>nitty</b>.  If passed as an integer, values
            from 0-5 may be used. The values 0-4 correspond to the
            strings already listed. The value 5 can be used to produce
            even more verbose debug output.

            The first form of this option activates message logging
            across all restore subsystems. The second form allows the
            message logging level to be controlled on a per-subsystem
            basis. The two forms can be combined (see the example
            below). The argument <i>subsys</i> can take one of the following
            values: <b>general</b>, <b>proc</b>, <b>drive</b>, <b>media</b>, <b>inventory</b>, and <b>tree</b>.

            For example, to restore the root filesystem with tracing
            activated for all subsystems:

                 <b># xfsrestore -v trace -f /dev/tape /</b>

            To enable debug-level tracing for drive and media
            operations:

                 <b># xfsrestore -v drive=debug,media=debug -f /dev/tape /</b>

            To enable tracing for all subsystems, and debug level
            tracing for drive operations only:

                 <b># xfsrestore -v trace,drive=debug -f /dev/tape /</b>

       <b>-A   </b>Do not restore extended file attributes.  When restoring a
            filesystem managed within a DMF environment this option
            should not be used. DMF stores file migration status within
            extended attributes associated with each file. If these
            attributes are not preserved when the filesystem is
            restored, files that had been in migrated state will not be
            recallable by DMF. Note that dumping of extended file
            attributes is also optional.

       <b>-B   </b>Change the ownership and permissions of the destination
            directory to match those of the root directory of the dump.

       <b>-D   </b>Restore DMAPI (Data Management Application Programming
            Interface) event settings. If the restored filesystem will
            be managed within the same DMF environment as the original
            dump it is essential that the -D option be used. Otherwise
            it is not usually desirable to restore these settings.

       <b>-E   </b>Prevents <i>xfsrestore</i> from overwriting newer versions of
            files.  The inode modification time of the on-media file is
            compared to the inode modification time of corresponding
            file in the <i>dest</i> directory.  The file is restored only if
            the on-media version is newer than the version in the <i>dest</i>
            directory.  The inode modification time of a file can be
            displayed with the <b>ls -lc </b>command.

       <b>-F   </b>Inhibit interactive operator prompts.  This option inhibits
            <i>xfsrestore</i> from prompting the operator for verification of
            the selected dump as the restore target and from prompting
            for any media change.

       <b>-I   </b>Causes the <i>xfsdump</i> inventory to be displayed (no restore is
            performed).  Each time <i>xfsdump</i> is used, an online inventory
            in <i>/var/lib/xfsdump/inventory</i> is updated.  This is used to
            determine the base for incremental dumps.  It is also useful
            for manually identifying a dump session to be restored (see
            the <b>-L </b>and <b>-S </b>options).  Suboptions to filter the inventory
            display are described later.

       <b>-J   </b>Inhibits inventory update when on-media session inventory
            encountered during restore.  <i>xfsrestore</i> opportunistically
            updates the online inventory when it encounters an on-media
            session inventory, but only if run with an effective user id
            of root and only if this option is not given.

       <b>-K   </b>Force <i>xfsrestore</i> to use dump format 2 generation numbers.
            Normally the need for this is determined automatically, but
            this option is required on the first <i>xfsrestore</i> invocation
            in the rare case that a cumulative restore begins with a
            format 3 (or newer) dump and will be followed by a format 2
            dump.

       <b>-L </b><i>session_label</i>
            Specifies the label of the dump session to be restored.  The
            source media is searched for this label.  It is any
            arbitrary string up to 255 characters long.  The label of
            the desired dump session can be copied from the inventory
            display produced by the <b>-I </b>option.

       <b>-O </b><i>options_file</i>
            Insert the options contained in <i>options_file</i> into the
            beginning of the command line.  The options are specified
            just as they would appear if typed into the command line.
            In addition, newline characters (\n) can be used as
            whitespace.  The options are placed before all options
            actually given on the command line, just after the command
            name.  Only one <b>-O </b>option can be used.  Recursive use is
            ignored.  The destination directory cannot be specified in
            <i>options_file</i>.

       <b>-Q   </b>Force completion of an interrupted restore session.  This
            option is required to work around one specific pathological
            scenario.  When restoring a dump session which was
            interrupted due to an EOM condition and no online session
            inventory is available, <i>xfsrestore</i> cannot know when the
            restore of that dump session is complete.  The operator is
            forced to interrupt the restore session.  In that case, if
            the operator tries to subsequently apply a resumed dump
            (using the <b>-r </b>option), <i>xfsrestore</i> refuses to do so.  The
            operator must tell <i>xfsrestore</i> to consider the base restore
            complete by using this option when applying the resumed
            dump.

       <b>-R   </b>Resume a previously interrupted restore.  <i>xfsrestore</i> can be
            interrupted at any time by pressing the terminal interrupt
            character (see <i>stty</i>(1)).  Use this option to resume the
            restore.  The <b>-a </b>and <i>destination</i> options must be the same.

       <b>-S </b><i>session_id</i>
            Specifies the session UUID of the dump session to be
            restored.  The source media is searched for this UUID.  The
            UUID of the desired dump session can be copied from the
            inventory display produced by the <b>-I </b>option.

       <b>-T   </b>Inhibits interactive dialogue timeouts.  <i>xfsrestore</i> prompts
            the operator for media changes.  This dialogue normally
            times out if no response is supplied.  This option prevents
            the timeout.

       <b>-X </b><i>subtree</i>
            Specifies a subtree to exclude.  This is the converse of the
            <b>-s </b>option.  Any number of <b>-X </b>options are allowed.  Each
            subtree is specified as a pathname relative to the restore
            <i>dest</i>.  If a directory is specified, the directory and all
            files beneath that directory are excluded.

       <b>-Y </b><i>io_ring_length</i>
            Specify I/O buffer ring length.  <i>xfsrestore</i> uses a ring of
            input buffers to achieve maximum throughput when restoring
            from tape drives.  The default ring length is 3.  However,
            this is not currently enabled on Linux yet, making this
            option benign.

       <b>-    </b>A lone <b>- </b>causes the standard input to be read as the source
            of the dump to be restored.  Standard input can be a pipe
            from another utility (such as <i>xfsdump</i>(8)) or a redirected
            file.  This option cannot be used with the <b>-f </b>option.  The <b>-</b>
            must follow all other options, and precede the <i>dest</i>
            specification.

       The dumped filesystem is restored into the <i>dest</i> directory.  There
       is no default; the <i>dest</i> must be specified.
