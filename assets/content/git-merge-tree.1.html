       Reads three tree-ish, and output trivial merge results and
       conflicting stages to the standard output. This is similar to
       what three-way <i>git read-tree -m</i> does, but instead of storing the
       results in the index, the command outputs the entries to the
       standard output.

       This is meant to be used by higher level scripts to compute merge
       results outside of the index, and stuff the results back into the
       index. For this reason, the output from the command omits entries
       that match the &lt;branch1&gt; tree.
