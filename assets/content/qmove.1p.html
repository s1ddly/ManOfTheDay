       To move a batch job is to remove the batch job from the batch
       queue in which it resides and instantiate the batch job in
       another batch queue.  A batch job is moved by a request to the
       batch server that manages the batch job. The <i>qmove</i> utility is a
       user-accessible batch client that requests the movement of one or
       more batch jobs.

       The <i>qmove</i> utility shall move those batch jobs, and only those
       batch jobs, for which a batch <i>job_identifier</i> is presented to the
       utility.

       The <i>qmove</i> utility shall move batch jobs in the order in which the
       corresponding batch <i>job_identifier</i>s are presented to the utility.

       If the <i>qmove</i> utility fails to process a batch <i>job_identifier</i>
       successfully, the utility shall proceed to process the remaining
       batch <i>job_identifier</i>s, if any.

       The <i>qmove</i> utility shall move batch jobs by sending a <i>Move Job</i>
       <i>Request</i> to the batch server that manages each batch job. The
       <i>qmove</i> utility shall not exit before the batch jobs corresponding
       to all successfully processed batch <i>job_identifier</i>s have been
       moved.
