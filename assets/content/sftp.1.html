     <b>sftp </b>is a file transfer program, similar to ftp(1), which performs
     all operations over an encrypted ssh(1) transport.  It may also use
     many features of ssh, such as public key authentication and
     compression.

     The <i>destination</i> may be specified either as [user@]host[:path] or as
     a URI in the form sftp://[user@]host[:port][/path].

     If the <i>destination</i> includes a <i>path</i> and it is not a directory, <b>sftp</b>
     will retrieve files automatically if a non-interactive
     authentication method is used; otherwise it will do so after
     successful interactive authentication.

     If no <i>path</i> is specified, or if the <i>path</i> is a directory, <b>sftp </b>will
     log in to the specified <i>host</i> and enter interactive command mode,
     changing to the remote directory if one was specified.  An optional
     trailing slash can be used to force the <i>path</i> to be interpreted as a
     directory.

     Since the destination formats use colon characters to delimit host
     names from path names or port numbers, IPv6 addresses must be
     enclosed in square brackets to avoid ambiguity.

     The options are as follows:

     <b>-4      </b>Forces <b>sftp </b>to use IPv4 addresses only.

     <b>-6      </b>Forces <b>sftp </b>to use IPv6 addresses only.

     <b>-A      </b>Allows forwarding of ssh-agent(1) to the remote system.
             The default is not to forward an authentication agent.

     <b>-a      </b>Attempt to continue interrupted transfers rather than
             overwriting existing partial or complete copies of files.
             If the partial contents differ from those being
             transferred, then the resultant file is likely to be
             corrupt.

     <b>-B </b><i>buffer_size</i>
             Specify the size of the buffer that <b>sftp </b>uses when
             transferring files.  Larger buffers require fewer round
             trips at the cost of higher memory consumption.  The
             default is 32768 bytes.

     <b>-b </b><i>batchfile</i>
             Batch mode reads a series of commands from an input
             <i>batchfile</i> instead of <i>stdin</i>.  Since it lacks user
             interaction it should be used in conjunction with non-
             interactive authentication to obviate the need to enter a
             password at connection time (see sshd(8) and ssh-keygen(1)
             for details).

             A <i>batchfile</i> of ‘-’ may be used to indicate standard input.
             <b>sftp </b>will abort if any of the following commands fail: <b>get</b>,
             <b>put</b>, <b>reget</b>, <b>reput</b>, <b>rename</b>, <b>ln</b>, <b>rm</b>, <b>mkdir</b>, <b>chdir</b>, <b>ls</b>,
             <b>lchdir</b>, <b>chmod</b>, <b>chown</b>, <b>chgrp</b>, <b>lpwd</b>, <b>df</b>, <b>symlink</b>, and <b>lmkdir</b>.

             Termination on error can be suppressed on a command by
             command basis by prefixing the command with a ‘-’ character
             (for example, <b>-rm /tmp/blah*</b>).  Echo of the command may be
             suppressed by prefixing the command with a ‘@’ character.
             These two prefixes may be combined in any order, for
             example <b>-@ls /bsd</b>.

     <b>-C      </b>Enables compression (via ssh's <b>-C </b>flag).

     <b>-c </b><i>cipher</i>
             Selects the cipher to use for encrypting the data
             transfers.  This option is directly passed to ssh(1).

     <b>-D </b><i>sftp_server_path</i>
             Connect directly to a local sftp server (rather than via
             ssh(1)).  This option may be useful in debugging the client
             and server.

     <b>-F </b><i>ssh_config</i>
             Specifies an alternative per-user configuration file for
             ssh(1).  This option is directly passed to ssh(1).

     <b>-f      </b>Requests that files be flushed to disk immediately after
             transfer.  When uploading files, this feature is only
             enabled if the server implements the "fsync@openssh.com"
             extension.

     <b>-i </b><i>identity_file</i>
             Selects the file from which the identity (private key) for
             public key authentication is read.  This option is directly
             passed to ssh(1).

     <b>-J </b><i>destination</i>
             Connect to the target host by first making an <b>sftp</b>
             connection to the jump host described by <i>destination</i> and
             then establishing a TCP forwarding to the ultimate
             destination from there.  Multiple jump hops may be
             specified separated by comma characters.  This is a
             shortcut to specify a <b>ProxyJump </b>configuration directive.
             This option is directly passed to ssh(1).

     <b>-l </b><i>limit</i>
             Limits the used bandwidth, specified in Kbit/s.

     <b>-N      </b>Disables quiet mode, e.g. to override the implicit quiet
             mode set by the <b>-b </b>flag.

     <b>-o </b><i>ssh_option</i>
             Can be used to pass options to <b>ssh </b>in the format used in
             ssh_config(5).  This is useful for specifying options for
             which there is no separate <b>sftp </b>command-line flag.  For
             example, to specify an alternate port use: <b>sftp -oPort=24</b>.
             For full details of the options listed below, and their
             possible values, see ssh_config(5).

     <b>-P </b><i>port</i>
             Specifies the port to connect to on the remote host.

     <b>-p      </b>Preserves modification times, access times, and modes from
             the original files transferred.

     <b>-q      </b>Quiet mode: disables the progress meter as well as warning
             and diagnostic messages from ssh(1).

     <b>-R </b><i>num_requests</i>
             Specify how many requests may be outstanding at any one
             time.  Increasing this may slightly improve file transfer
             speed but will increase memory usage.  The default is 64
             outstanding requests.

     <b>-r      </b>Recursively copy entire directories when uploading and
             downloading.  Note that <b>sftp </b>does not follow symbolic links
             encountered in the tree traversal.

     <b>-S </b><i>program</i>
             Name of the <i>program</i> to use for the encrypted connection.
             The program must understand ssh(1) options.

     <b>-s </b><i>subsystem</i> | <i>sftp_server</i>
             Specifies the SSH2 subsystem or the path for an sftp server
             on the remote host.  A path is useful when the remote
             sshd(8) does not have an sftp subsystem configured.

     <b>-v      </b>Raise logging level.  This option is also passed to ssh.
