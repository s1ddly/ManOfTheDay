       <b>Slapschema </b>is used to check schema compliance of the contents of
       a <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/slapd.8.html">slapd(8)</a> database.  It opens the given database determined by
       the database number or suffix and checks the compliance of its
       contents with the corresponding schema. Errors are written to
       standard output or the specified file.  Databases configured as
       <b>subordinate </b>of this one are also output, unless <b>-g </b>is specified.

       Administrators may need to modify existing schema items,
       including adding new required attributes to objectClasses,
       removing existing required or allowed attributes from
       objectClasses, entirely removing objectClasses, or any other
       change that may result in making perfectly valid entries no
       longer compliant with the modified schema.  The execution of the
       <b>slapschema </b>tool after modifying the schema can point out
       inconsistencies that would otherwise surface only when
       inconsistent entries need to be modified.

       The entry records are checked in database order, not superior
       first order.  The entry records will be checked considering all
       (user and operational) attributes stored in the database.
       Dynamically generated attributes (such as subschemaSubentry) will
       not be considered.
