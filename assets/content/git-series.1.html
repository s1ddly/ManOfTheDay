       <b>git series </b>tracks changes to a patch series over time.  <b>git</b>
       <b>series </b>also tracks a cover letter for the patch series, formats
       the series for email, and prepares pull requests.

       Use <b>git series start </b><i>seriesname</i> to start a patch series
       <i>seriesname</i>.  Use normal <b>git </b>commands to commit changes, and use
       <b>git series status </b>to check what has changed.  Use <b>git series</b>
       <b>cover </b>to add or edit a cover letter.  Use <b>git series add </b>and <b>git</b>
       <b>series commit </b>(or <b>git series commit -a</b>) to commit changes to the
       patch series.  Use <b>git series rebase -i </b>to help rework or
       reorganize the patch series.  Use <b>git series format </b>to prepare
       the patch series to send via email, or <b>git series req </b>to prepare
       a "please pull" mail.

       Running <b>git series </b>without arguments shows the list of patch
       series, marking the current patch series with a '*'.
