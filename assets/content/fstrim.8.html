       <b>fstrim </b>is used on a mounted filesystem to discard (or "trim")
       blocks which are not in use by the filesystem. This is useful for
       solid-state drives (SSDs) and thinly-provisioned storage.

       By default, <b>fstrim </b>will discard all unused blocks in the
       filesystem. Options may be used to modify this behavior based on
       range or size, as explained below.

       The <i>mountpoint</i> argument is the pathname of the directory where
       the filesystem is mounted.

       Running <b>fstrim </b>frequently, or even using <b>mount -o discard</b>, might
       negatively affect the lifetime of poor-quality SSD devices. For
       most desktop and server systems a sufficient trimming frequency
       is once a week. Note that not all devices support a queued trim,
       so each trim command incurs a performance penalty on whatever
       else might be trying to use the disk at the time.
