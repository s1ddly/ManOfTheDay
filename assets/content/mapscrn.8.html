       The <b>mapscrn </b>command is obsolete - its function is now built-in
       into setfont.  However, for backwards compatibility it is still
       available as a separate command.

       The <i>mapscrn</i> command loads a user defined output character mapping
       table into the console driver. The console driver may be later
       put into <b>use user-defined mapping table </b>mode by outputting a
       special escape sequence to the console device.  This sequence is
       <i>&lt;esc&gt;(K</i> for the <b>G0 </b>character set and <i>&lt;esc&gt;)K</i> for the <b>G1 </b>character
       set.  When the <i>-o</i> option is given, the old map is saved in
       <i>map.orig.</i>
