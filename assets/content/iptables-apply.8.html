       iptables-apply will try to apply a new rulesfile (as output by
       iptables-save, read by iptables-restore) or run a command to
       configure iptables and then prompt the user whether the changes
       are okay. If the new iptables rules cut the existing connection,
       the user will not be able to answer affirmatively. In this case,
       the script rolls back to the previous working iptables rules
       after the timeout expires.

       Successfully applied rules can also be written to savefile and
       later used to roll back to this state. This can be used to
       implement a store last good configuration mechanism when
       experimenting with an iptables setup script: iptables-apply -w
       /etc/network/iptables.up.rules -c /etc/network/iptables.up.run

       When called as ip6tables-apply, the script will use
       ip6tables-save/-restore and IPv6 default values instead. Default
       value for rulesfile is '/etc/network/iptables.up.rules'.
