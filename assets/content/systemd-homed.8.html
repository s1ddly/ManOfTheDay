       <b>systemd-homed </b>is a system service that may be used to create,
       remove, change or inspect home areas (directories and network
       mounts and real or loopback block devices with a filesystem,
       optionally encrypted).

       Most of <b>systemd-homed</b>'s functionality is accessible through the
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/homectl.1.html">homectl(1)</a> command.

       See the <b>Home Directories</b><b></b>[1] documentation for details about the
       format and design of home areas managed by systemd-homed.service.

       Each home directory managed by systemd-homed.service synthesizes
       a local user and group. These are made available to the system
       using the <b>User/Group Record Lookup API via Varlink</b><b></b>[2], and thus
       may be browsed with <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/userdbctl.1.html">userdbctl(1)</a>.
