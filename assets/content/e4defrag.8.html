       <b>e4defrag </b>reduces fragmentation of extent based file. The file
       targeted by <b>e4defrag </b>is created on ext4 file system made with "-O
       extent" option (see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/mke2fs.8.html">mke2fs(8)</a>).  The targeted file gets more
       contiguous blocks and improves the file access speed.

       <i>target</i> is a regular file, a directory, or a device that is
       mounted as ext4 file system.  If <i>target</i> is a directory, <b>e4defrag</b>
       reduces fragmentation of all files in it. If <i>target</i> is a device,
       <b>e4defrag </b>gets the mount point of it and reduces fragmentation of
       all files in this mount point.
