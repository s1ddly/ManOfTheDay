           <b>Note</b>
           Using this helper will store your passwords unencrypted on
           disk, protected only by filesystem permissions. If this is
           not an acceptable security tradeoff, try
           <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/git-credential-cache.1.html">git-credential-cache(1)</a>, or find a helper that integrates
           with secure storage provided by your operating system.

       This command stores credentials indefinitely on disk for use by
       future Git programs.

       You probably donâ€™t want to invoke this command directly; it is
       meant to be used as a credential helper by other parts of git.
       See <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/gitcredentials.7.html">gitcredentials(7)</a> or <b>EXAMPLES </b>below.
