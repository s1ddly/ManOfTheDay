       The <b>@TABS@ </b>program clears and sets tab-stops on the terminal.
       This uses the terminfo <i>clear_all_tabs</i> and <i>set_tab</i> capabilities.
       If either is absent, <b>@TABS@ </b>is unable to clear/set tab-stops.
       The terminal should be configured to use hard tabs, e.g.,

           stty tab0

       Like <b>@CLEAR@</b>(1), <b>@TABS@ </b>writes to the standard output.  You can
       redirect the standard output to a file (which prevents <b>@TABS@</b>
       from actually changing the tabstops), and later <b>cat </b>the file to
       the screen, setting tabstops at that point.

       These are hardware tabs, which cannot be queried rapidly by
       applications running in the terminal, if at all.  Curses and
       other full-screen applications may use hardware tabs in
       optimizing their output to the terminal.  If the hardware
       tabstops differ from the information in the terminal database,
       the result is unpredictable.  Before running curses programs, you
       should either reset tab-stops to the standard interval

           tabs -8

       or use the <b>@RESET@ </b>program, since the normal initialization
       sequences do not ensure that tab-stops are reset.
