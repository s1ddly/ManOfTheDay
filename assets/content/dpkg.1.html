       <b>dpkg </b>is a tool to install, build, remove and manage Debian
       packages. The primary and more user-friendly front-end for <b>dpkg</b>
       is <b>aptitude</b>(1). <b>dpkg </b>itself is controlled entirely via command
       line parameters, which consist of exactly one action and zero or
       more options. The action-parameter tells <b>dpkg </b>what to do and
       options control the behavior of the action in some way.

       <b>dpkg </b>can also be used as a front-end to <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dpkg-deb.1.html">dpkg-deb(1)</a> and
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dpkg-query.1.html">dpkg-query(1)</a>. The list of supported actions can be found later
       on in the <b>ACTIONS </b>section. If any such action is encountered <b>dpkg</b>
       just runs <b>dpkg-deb </b>or <b>dpkg-query </b>with the parameters given to it,
       but no specific options are currently passed to them, to use any
       such option the back-ends need to be called directly.
