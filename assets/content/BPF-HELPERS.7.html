       The extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) subsystem consists in
       programs written in a pseudo-assembly language, then attached to
       one of the several kernel hooks and run in reaction of specific
       events. This framework differs from the older, "classic" BPF (or
       "cBPF") in several aspects, one of them being the ability to call
       special functions (or "helpers") from within a program.  These
       functions are restricted to a white-list of helpers defined in
       the kernel.

       These helpers are used by eBPF programs to interact with the
       system, or with the context in which they work. For instance,
       they can be used to print debugging messages, to get the time
       since the system was booted, to interact with eBPF maps, or to
       manipulate network packets. Since there are several eBPF program
       types, and that they do not run in the same context, each program
       type can only call a subset of those helpers.

       Due to eBPF conventions, a helper can not have more than five
       arguments.

       Internally, eBPF programs call directly into the compiled helper
       functions without requiring any foreign-function interface. As a
       result, calling helpers introduces no overhead, thus offering
       excellent performance.

       This document is an attempt to list and document the helpers
       available to eBPF developers. They are sorted by chronological
       order (the oldest helpers in the kernel at the top).
