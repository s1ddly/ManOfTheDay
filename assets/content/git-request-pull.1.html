       Generate a request asking your upstream project to pull changes
       into their tree. The request, printed to the standard output,
       begins with the branch description, summarizes the changes and
       indicates from where they can be pulled.

       The upstream project is expected to have the commit named by
       <b>&lt;start&gt; </b>and the output asks it to integrate the changes you made
       since that commit, up to the commit named by <b>&lt;end&gt;</b>, by visiting
       the repository named by <b>&lt;url&gt;</b>.
