<pre>
       The shell shall give the <i>export</i> attribute to the variables
       corresponding to the specified <i>name</i>s, which shall cause them to
       be in the environment of subsequently executed commands. If the
       name of a variable is followed by =<i>word</i>, then the value of that
       variable shall be set to <i>word</i>.

       The <i>export</i> special built-in shall support the Base Definitions
       volume of POSIX.1‚Äê2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>.

       When <b>-p </b>is specified, <i>export</i> shall write to the standard output
       the names and values of all exported variables, in the following
       format:

           "export %s=%s\n", &lt;<i>name</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>value</i>&gt;

       if <i>name</i> is set, and:

           "export %s\n", &lt;<i>name</i>&gt;

       if <i>name</i> is unset.

       The shell shall format the output, including the proper use of
       quoting, so that it is suitable for reinput to the shell as
       commands that achieve the same exporting results, except:

        1. Read-only variables with values cannot be reset.

        2. Variables that were unset at the time they were output need
           not be reset to the unset state if a value is assigned to the
           variable between the time the state was saved and the time at
           which the saved output is reinput to the shell.

       When no arguments are given, the results are unspecified.
