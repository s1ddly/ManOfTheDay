       <b>systemd-networkd-wait-online </b>is a oneshot system service (see
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/systemd.service.5.html">systemd.service(5)</a>), that waits for the network to be configured.
       By default, it will wait for all links it is aware of and which
       are managed by <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/systemd-networkd.service.8.html">systemd-networkd.service(8)</a> to be fully configured
       or failed, and for at least one link to be online. Here, online
       means that the link's operational state is equal or higher than
       "degraded". The threshold can be configured by
       <b>--operational-state= </b>option.
