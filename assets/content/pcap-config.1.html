       When run with the <b>--cflags </b>option, <i>pcap-config</i> writes to the
       standard output the <b>-I </b>compiler flags required to include
       libpcap's header files.  When run with the <b>--libs </b>option, <i>pcap-</i>
       <i>config</i> writes to the standard output the <b>-L </b>and <b>-l </b>linker flags
       required to link with libpcap, including <b>-l </b>flags for libraries
       required by libpcap.  When run with the <b>--additional-libs </b>option,
       <i>pcap-config</i> writes to the standard output the <b>-L </b>and <b>-l </b>flags for
       libraries required by libpcap, but not the <b>-lpcap </b>flag to link
       with libpcap itself.

       By default, it writes flags appropriate for compiling with a
       dynamically-linked version of libpcap; the <b>--static </b>flag causes
       it to write flags appropriate for compiling with a statically-
       linked version of libpcap.
