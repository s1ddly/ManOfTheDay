       <b>mysql </b>is a simple SQL shell (with GNU readline capabilities). It
       supports interactive and non-interactive use. When used
       interactively, query results are presented in an ASCII-table
       format. When used non-interactively (for example, as a filter),
       the result is presented in tab-separated format. The output
       format can be changed using command options.

       If you have problems due to insufficient memory for large result
       sets, use the <b>--quick </b>option. This forces <b>mysql </b>to retrieve
       results from the server a row at a time rather than retrieving
       the entire result set and buffering it in memory before
       displaying it. This is done by returning the result set using the
       mysql_use_result() C API function in the client/server library
       rather than mysql_store_result().

       Using <b>mysql </b>is very easy. Invoke it from the prompt of your
       command interpreter as follows:

           shell&gt; <b>mysql </b><i>db_name</i>

       Or:

           shell&gt; <b>mysql --user=</b><i>user_name</i> <b>--password=</b><i>your_password db_name</i>

       Then type an SQL statement, end it with “;”, \g, or \G and press
       Enter.

       Typing Control-C causes <b>mysql </b>to attempt to kill the current
       statement. If this cannot be done, or Control-C is typed again
       before the statement is killed, <b>mysql </b>exits.

       You can execute SQL statements in a script file (batch file) like
       this:

           shell&gt; <b>mysql </b><i>db_name</i> <b>&lt; </b><i>script.sql</i> <b>&gt; </b><i>output.tab</i>
