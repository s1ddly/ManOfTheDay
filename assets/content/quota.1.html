       <b>quota </b>displays users' disk usage and limits.  By default only the
       user quotas are printed. By default space usage and limits are
       shown in kbytes (and are named blocks for historical reasons).

       <b>quota </b>reports the quotas of all the filesystems listed in
       <b>/etc/mtab</b>.  For filesystems that are NFS-mounted a call to the
       rpc.rquotad on the server machine is performed to get the
       information.
