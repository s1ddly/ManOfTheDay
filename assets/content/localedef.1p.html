       The <i>localedef</i> utility shall convert source definitions for locale
       categories into a format usable by the functions and utilities
       whose operational behavior is determined by the setting of the
       locale environment variables defined in the Base Definitions
       volume of POSIX.1‚Äê2017, <i>Chapter 7</i>, <i>Locale</i>.  It is implementation-
       defined whether users have the capability to create new locales,
       in addition to those supplied by the implementation. If the
       symbolic constant POSIX2_LOCALEDEF is defined, the system
       supports the creation of new locales.  On XSI-conformant systems,
       the symbolic constant POSIX2_LOCALEDEF shall be defined.

       The utility shall read source definitions for one or more locale
       categories belonging to the same locale from the file named in
       the <b>-i </b>option (if specified) or from standard input.

       The <i>name</i> operand identifies the target locale. The utility shall
       support the creation of <i>public</i>, or generally accessible locales,
       as well as <i>private</i>, or restricted-access locales. Implementations
       may restrict the capability to create or modify public locales to
       users with appropriate privileges.

       Each category source definition shall be identified by the
       corresponding environment variable name and terminated by an <b>END</b>
       <i>category-name</i> statement. The following categories shall be
       supported. In addition, the input may contain source for
       implementation-defined categories.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Defines character classification and case conversion.

       <i>LC_COLLATE</i>
                 Defines collation rules.

       <i>LC_MONETARY</i>
                 Defines the format and symbols used in formatting of
                 monetary information.

       <i>LC_NUMERIC</i>
                 Defines the decimal delimiter, grouping, and grouping
                 symbol for non-monetary numeric editing.

       <i>LC_TIME</i>   Defines the format and content of date and time
                 information.

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Defines the format and values of affirmative and
                 negative responses.
