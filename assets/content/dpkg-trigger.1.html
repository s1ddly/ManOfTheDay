       <b>dpkg-trigger </b>is a tool to explicitly activate triggers and check
       for its support on the running <b>dpkg</b>.

       This can be used by maintainer scripts in complex and conditional
       situations where the file triggers, or the declarative <b>activate</b>
       triggers control file directive, are insufficiently rich. It can
       also be used for testing and by system administrators (but note
       that the triggers won't actually be run by <b>dpkg-trigger</b>).

       Unrecognized trigger name syntaxes are an error for <b>dpkg-trigger</b>.
