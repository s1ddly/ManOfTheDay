       The <b>ip </b>utility can monitor the state of devices, addresses and
       routes continuously. This option has a slightly different format.
       Namely, the <b>monitor </b>command is the first in the command line and
       then the object list follows:

       <b>ip monitor </b>[ <b>all </b>| <i>OBJECT-LIST</i> ] [ <b>file </b><i>FILENAME</i> ] [ <b>label </b>] [
       <b>all-nsid </b>] [ <b>dev </b><i>DEVICE</i> ]

       <i>OBJECT-LIST</i> is the list of object types that we want to monitor.
       It may contain <b>link</b>, <b>address</b>, <b>route</b>, <b>mroute</b>, <b>prefix</b>, <b>neigh</b>,
       <b>netconf</b>, <b>rule</b>, <b>nsid </b>and <b>nexthop</b>.  If no <b>file </b>argument is given,
       <b>ip </b>opens RTNETLINK, listens on it and dumps state changes in the
       format described in previous sections.

       If the <b>label </b>option is set, a prefix is displayed before each
       message to show the family of the message. For example:

         [NEIGH]10.16.0.112 dev eth0 lladdr 00:04:23:df:2f:d0 REACHABLE
         [LINK]3: eth1: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast
         state DOWN group default
             link/ether 52:54:00:12:34:57 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff

       If the <b>all-nsid </b>option is set, the program listens to all network
       namespaces that have a nsid assigned into the network namespace
       were the program is running.  A prefix is displayed to show the
       network namespace where the message originates. Example:

         [nsid 0]10.16.0.112 dev eth0 lladdr 00:04:23:df:2f:d0 REACHABLE

       If the <b>file </b>option is given, the program does not listen on
       RTNETLINK, but opens the given file, and dumps its contents. The
       file should contain RTNETLINK messages saved in binary format.
       Such a file can be generated with the <b>rtmon </b>utility. This utility
       has a command line syntax similar to <b>ip monitor</b>.  Ideally, <b>rtmon</b>
       should be started before the first network configuration command
       is issued. F.e. if you insert:

               rtmon file /var/log/rtmon.log

       in a startup script, you will be able to view the full history
       later.

       Nevertheless, it is possible to start <b>rtmon </b>at any time.  It
       prepends the history with the state snapshot dumped at the moment
       of starting.

       If the <b>dev </b>option is given, the program prints only events
       related to this device.
