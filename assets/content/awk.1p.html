<pre>
       The <i>awk</i> utility shall execute programs written in the <i>awk</i>
       programming language, which is specialized for textual data
       manipulation. An <i>awk</i> program is a sequence of patterns and
       corresponding actions. When input is read that matches a pattern,
       the action associated with that pattern is carried out.

       Input shall be interpreted as a sequence of records. By default,
       a record is a line, less its terminating &lt;newline&gt;, but this can
       be changed by using the <b>RS </b>built-in variable. Each record of
       input shall be matched in turn against each pattern in the
       program. For each pattern matched, the associated action shall be
       executed.

       The <i>awk</i> utility shall interpret each input record as a sequence
       of fields where, by default, a field is a string of non-&lt;blank&gt;
       non-&lt;newline&gt; characters. This default &lt;blank&gt; and &lt;newline&gt;
       field delimiter can be changed by using the <b>FS </b>built-in variable
       or the <b>-F </b><i>sepstring</i> option. The <i>awk</i> utility shall denote the
       first field in a record $1, the second $2, and so on. The symbol
       $0 shall refer to the entire record; setting any other field
       causes the re-evaluation of $0. Assigning to $0 shall reset the
       values of all other fields and the <b>NF </b>built-in variable.
