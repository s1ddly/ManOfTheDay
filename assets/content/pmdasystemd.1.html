       <b>pmdasystemd </b>is a systemd log file monitoring Performance Metrics
       Domain Agent (PMDA).  It can be seen as analagous to the <b>-f</b>
       option to <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/journalctl.1.html">journalctl(1)</a> and converts each new log line into a
       performance event, suitable for consumption by <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/PMAPI.3.html">PMAPI(3)</a> client
       tools like <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmevent.1.html">pmevent(1)</a>.

       The <b>systemd </b>PMDA exports both event-style metrics reflecting
       timestamped event records for messages logged to the system logs,
       as well as the more orthodox sample-style metrics such as message
       counts and throughput size values.

       A brief description of the <b>pmdasystemd </b>command line options
       follows:

       <b>-d   </b>It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics <i>domain</i>
            number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is,
            <i>domain</i> should be different for every PMDA on the one host,
            and the same <i>domain</i> number should be used for the same PMDA
            on all hosts.

       <b>-f   </b>Disables per-uid/gid record filtering.  By default the user
            and group credentials will be used to filter log records
            returned to the client tool, preventing information exposure
            to arbitrary users.  This option disables that, so use only
            with extreme caution.

       <b>-l   </b>Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
            <i>systemd.log</i> is written in the current directory of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a>
            when <b>pmdasystemd </b>is started, i.e.  <b>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd</b>.  If
            the log file cannot be created or is not writable, output is
            written to the standard error instead.

       <b>-m   </b>Limit the physical memory used by the PMDA to buffer event
            records to <i>maxsize</i> bytes.  As log events arrive at the PMDA,
            they must be buffered until individual client tools request
            the next batch since their previous batch of events.  The
            default maximum is 2 megabytes.

       <b>-s   </b>Sets the polling interval for detecting newly arrived log
            lines.  Mirrors the same option from the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/tail.1.html">tail(1)</a> command.

       <b>-U   </b>User account under which to run the agent.  The default is
            the "adm" user account.
