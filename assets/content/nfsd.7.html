       The <b>nfsd </b>filesystem is a special filesystem which provides access
       to the Linux NFS server.  Writing to files in this filesystem can
       affect the server.  Reading from them can provide information
       about the server.

       As well as this filesystem, there are a collection of files in
       the <b>procfs </b>filesystem (normally mounted at <b>/proc</b>) which are used
       to control the NFS server.  This manual page describes all of
       these files.

       The <i>exportfs</i> and <i>mountd</i> programs (part of the nfs-utils package)
       expect to find this filesystem mounted at <b>/proc/fs/nfsd </b>or
       <b>/proc/fs/nfs</b>.
