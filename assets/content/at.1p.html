<pre>
       The <i>at</i> utility shall read commands from standard input and group
       them together as an <i>at-job</i>, to be executed at a later time.

       The at-job shall be executed in a separate invocation of the
       shell, running in a separate process group with no controlling
       terminal, except that the environment variables, current working
       directory, file creation mask, and other implementation-defined
       execution-time attributes in effect when the <i>at</i> utility is
       executed shall be retained and used when the at-job is executed.

       When the at-job is submitted, the <i>at_job_id</i> and scheduled time
       shall be written to standard error. The <i>at_job_id</i> is an
       identifier that shall be a string consisting solely of
       alphanumeric characters and the &lt;period&gt; character. The <i>at_job_id</i>
       shall be assigned by the system when the job is scheduled such
       that it uniquely identifies a particular job.

       User notification and the processing of the job's standard output
       and standard error are described under the <b>-m </b>option.

       Users shall be permitted to use <i>at</i> if their name appears in the
       file <b>at.allow </b>which is located in an implementation-defined
       directory.  If that file does not exist, the file <b>at.deny</b>, which
       is located in an implementation-defined directory, shall be
       checked to determine whether the user shall be denied access to
       <i>at</i>.  If neither file exists, only a process with appropriate
       privileges shall be allowed to submit a job. If only <b>at.deny</b>
       exists and is empty, global usage shall be permitted. The
       <b>at.allow </b>and <b>at.deny </b>files shall consist of one user name per
       line.
