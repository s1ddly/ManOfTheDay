       <b>systemd-sysext </b>activates/deactivates system extension images.
       System extension images may – dynamically at runtime — extend the
       /usr/ and /opt/ directory hierarchies with additional files. This
       is particularly useful on immutable system images where a /usr/
       and/or /opt/ hierarchy residing on a read-only file system shall
       be extended temporarily at runtime without making any persistent
       modifications.

       System extension images should contain files and directories
       similar in fashion to regular operating system tree. When one or
       more system extension images are activated, their /usr/ and /opt/
       hierarchies are combined via "overlayfs" with the same
       hierarchies of the host OS, and the host /usr/ and /opt/
       overmounted with it ("merging"). When they are deactivated, the
       mount point is disassembled — again revealing the unmodified
       original host version of the hierarchy ("unmerging"). Merging
       thus makes the extension's resources suddenly appear below the
       /usr/ and /opt/ hierarchies as if they were included in the base
       OS image itself. Unmerging makes them disappear again, leaving in
       place only the files that were shipped with the base OS image
       itself.

       Files and directories contained in the extension images outside
       of the /usr/ and /opt/ hierarchies are <i>not</i> merged, and hence have
       no effect when included in a system extension image. In
       particular, files in the /etc/ and /var/ included in a system
       extension image will <i>not</i> appear in the respective hierarchies
       after activation.

       System extension images are strictly read-only, and the host
       /usr/ and /opt/ hierarchies become read-only too while they are
       activated.

       System extensions are supposed to be purely additive, i.e. they
       are supposed to include only files that do not exist in the
       underlying basic OS image. However, the underlying mechanism
       (overlayfs) also allows removing files, but it is recommended not
       to make use of this.

       System extension images may be provided in the following formats:

        1. Plain directories or btrfs subvolumes containing the OS tree

        2. Disk images with a GPT disk label, following the <b>Discoverable</b>
           <b>Partitions Specification</b><b></b>[1]

        3. Disk images lacking a partition table, with a naked Linux
           file system (e.g. squashfs or ext4)

       These image formats are the same ones that <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/systemd-nspawn.1.html">systemd-nspawn(1)</a>
       supports via it's <b>--directory=</b>/<b>--image= </b>switches and those that
       the service manager supports via <b>RootDirectory=</b>/<b>RootImage=</b>.
       Similar to them they may optionally carry Verity authentication
       information.

       System extensions are automatically looked for in the directories
       /etc/extensions/, /run/extensions/, /var/lib/extensions/,
       /usr/lib/extensions/ and /usr/local/lib/extensions/. The first
       two listed directories are not suitable for carrying large binary
       images, however are still useful for carrying symlinks to them.
       The primary place for installing system extensions is
       /var/lib/extensions/. Any directories found in these search
       directories are considered directory based extension images, any
       files with the .raw suffix are considered disk image based
       extension images.

       During boot OS extension images are activated automatically, if
       the systemd-sysext.service is enabled. Note that this service
       runs only after the underlying file systems where system
       extensions may be located have been mounted. This means they are
       not suitable for shipping resources that are processed by
       subsystems running in earliest boot. Specifically, OS extension
       images are not suitable for shipping system services or
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/systemd-sysusers.8.html">systemd-sysusers(8)</a> definitions. See <b>Portable Services</b><b></b>[2] for a
       simple mechanism for shipping system services in disk images, in
       a similar fashion to OS extensions. Note the different isolation
       on these two mechanisms: while system extension directly extend
       the underlying OS image with additional files that appear in a
       way very similar to as if they were shipped in the OS image
       itself and thus imply no security isolation, portable services
       imply service level sandboxing in one way or another. The
       systemd-sysext.service service is guaranteed to finish start-up
       before basic.target is reached; i.e. at the time regular services
       initialize (those which do not use <i>DefaultDependencies=no</i>), the
       files and directories system extensions provide are available in
       /usr/ and /opt/ and may be accessed.

       Note that there is no concept of enabling/disabling installed
       system extension images: all installed extension images are
       automatically activated at boot.

       A simple mechanism for version compatibility is enforced: a
       system extension image must carry a
       /usr/lib/extension-release.d/extension-release.<i>$name</i> file, which
       must match its image name, that is compared with the host
       os-release file: the contained <i>ID=</i> fields have to match, as well
       as the <i>SYSEXT_LEVEL=</i> field (if defined). If the latter is not
       defined, the <i>VERSION_ID=</i> field has to match instead. System
       extensions should not ship a /usr/lib/os-release file (as that
       would be merged into the host /usr/ tree, overriding the host OS
       version data, which is not desirable). The extension-release file
       follows the same format and semantics, and carries the same
       content, as the os-release file of the OS, but it describes the
       resources carried in the extension image.
