       The <b>ovsdb-client </b>program is a command-line client for interacting
       with a running <b>ovsdb-server </b>process.  Each command connects to
       the specified OVSDB <i>server</i>, which may be an OVSDB active or
       passive connection method, as described in <b>ovsdb</b>(7).  The default
       server is <b>unix:/usr/local/var/run/openvswitch/db.sock </b>and the
       default <i>database</i> is <b>Open_vSwitch</b>.

       <b>ovsdb-client </b>supports the <i>method1</i><b>,</b><i>method2</i><b>,</b>...<b>,</b><i>methodN</i> syntax
       described in <b>ovsdb</b>(7) for connecting to a cluster.  When this
       syntax is used, <b>ovsdb-client </b>tries the cluster members in random
       order until it finds the cluster leader.  Specify the
       <b>--no-leader-only </b>option to instead accept any server that is
       connected to the cluster.

       For an introduction to OVSDB and its implementation in Open
       vSwitch, see <b>ovsdb</b>(7).

       The following sections describe the commands that <b>ovsdb-client</b>
       supports.

   <b>Server-Level Commands</b>
       Most <b>ovsdb-client </b>commands work with an individual database, but
       these commands apply to an entire database server.

       <b>list-dbs </b>[<i>server</i>]
              Connects to <i>server</i>, retrieves the list of known databases,
              and prints them one per line.  These database names are
              the ones that other commands may use for <i>database</i>.

   <b>Database Schema Commands</b>
       These commands obtain the schema from a database and print it or
       part of it.

       <b>get-schema </b>[<i>server</i>] [<i>database</i>]
              Connects to <i>server</i>, retrieves the schema for <i>database</i>, and
              prints it in JSON format.

       <b>list-tables </b>[<i>server</i>] [<i>database</i>]
              Connects to <i>server</i>, retrieves the schema for <i>database</i>, and
              prints a table listing the name of each table within the
              database.

       <b>list-columns </b>[<i>server</i>] [<i>database</i>] <i>table</i>
              Connects to <i>server</i>, retrieves the schema for <i>database</i>, and
              prints a table listing the name and type of each column.
              If <i>table</i> is specified, only columns in that table are
              listed; otherwise, the tables include columns in all
              tables.

   <b>Database Version Management Commands</b>
       An OVSDB schema has a schema version number, and an OVSDB
       database embeds a particular version of an OVSDB schema.  These
       version numbers take the form <i>x</i><b>.</b><i>y</i><b>.</b><i>z</i>, e.g. <b>1.2.3</b>.  The OVSDB
       implementation does not enforce a particular version numbering
       scheme, but schemas managed within the Open vSwitch project use
       the following approach.  Whenever the database schema is changed
       in a non-backward compatible way (e.g. deleting a column or a
       table), <i>x</i> is incremented (and <i>y</i> and <i>z</i> are reset to 0).  When the
       database schema is changed in a backward compatible way (e.g.
       adding a new column), <i>y</i> is incremented (and <i>z</i> is reset to 0).
       When the database schema is changed cosmetically (e.g.
       reindenting its syntax), <i>z</i> is incremented.

       Some OVSDB databases and schemas, especially very old ones, do
       not have a version number.

       Schema version numbers and Open vSwitch version numbers are
       independent.

       These commands work with different versions of OVSDB schemas and
       databases.

       <b>convert </b>[<i>server</i>] <i>schema</i>
              Reads an OVSDB schema in JSON format, as specified in the
              OVSDB specification, from <i>schema</i>, then connects to <i>server</i>
              and requests the server to convert the database whose name
              is specified in <i>schema</i> to the schema also specified in
              <i>schema</i>.

              The conversion is atomic, consistent, isolated, and
              durable.  Following the schema change, the server notifies
              clients that use the <b>set_db_change_aware </b>RPC introduced in
              Open vSwitch 2.9 and cancels their outstanding
              transactions and monitors.  The server disconnects other
              clients, enabling them to notice the change when they
              reconnect.

              This command can do simple ``upgrades'' and ``downgrades''
              on a database's schema.  The data in the database must be
              valid when interpreted under <i>schema</i>, with only one
              exception: data for tables and columns that do not exist
              in <i>schema</i> are ignored.  Columns that exist in <i>schema</i> but
              not in the database are set to their default values.  All
              of <i>schema</i>'s constraints apply in full.

              Some uses of this command can cause unrecoverable data
              loss.  For example, converting a database from a schema
              that has a given column or table to one that does not will
              delete all data in that column or table.  Back up critical
              databases before converting them.

              This command works with clustered and standalone
              databases.  Standalone databases may also be converted
              (offline) with <b>ovsdb-tool</b>'s <b>convert </b>command.

       <b>needs-conversion </b>[<i>server</i>] <i>schema</i>
              Reads the schema from <i>schema</i>, then connects to <i>server</i> and
              requests the schema from the database whose name is
              specified in <i>schema</i>.  If the two schemas are the same,
              prints <b>no </b>on stdout; if they differ, prints <b>yes</b>.

       <b>get-schema-version </b>[<i>server</i>] [<i>database</i>]
              Connects to <i>server</i>, retrieves the schema for <i>database</i>, and
              prints its version number on stdout.  If <i>database</i> was
              created before schema versioning was introduced, then it
              will not have a version number and this command will print
              a blank line.

       <b>get-schema-cksum </b>[<i>server</i>] [<i>database</i>]
              Connects to <i>server</i>, retrieves the schema for <i>database</i>, and
              prints its checksum on stdout.  If <i>database</i> does not
              include a checksum, prints a blank line.

   <b>Data Management Commands</b>
       These commands read or modify the data in a database.

       <b>transact </b>[<i>server</i>] <i>transaction</i>
              Connects to <i>server</i>, sends it the specified <i>transaction</i>,
              which must be a JSON array appropriate for use as the
              <b>params </b>to a JSON-RPC <b>transact </b>request, and prints the
              received reply on stdout.

       <b>query </b>[<i>server</i>] <i>transaction</i>
              This commands acts like a read-only version of <b>transact</b>.
              It connects to <i>server</i>, sends it the specified <i>transaction</i>,
              which must be a JSON array appropriate for use as the
              <b>params </b>to a JSON-RPC <b>transact </b>request, and prints the
              received reply on stdout.  To ensure that the transaction
              does not modify the database, this command appends an
              <b>abort </b>operation to the set of operations included in
              <i>transaction</i> before sending it to the database, and then
              removes the <b>abort </b>result from the reply (if it is
              present).

       <b>dump </b>[<i>server</i>] [<i>database</i>] [<i>table</i> [<i>column</i>...]]
              Connects to <i>server</i>, retrieves all of the data in <i>database</i>,
              and prints it on stdout as a series of tables. If <i>table</i> is
              specified, only that table is retrieved.  If at least one
              <i>column</i> is specified, only those columns are retrieved.

       <b>backup </b>[<i>server</i>] [<i>database</i>] <b>&gt; </b><i>snapshot</i>
              Connects to <i>server</i>, retrieves a snapshot of the schema and
              data in <i>database</i>, and prints it on stdout in the format
              used for OVSDB standalone and active-backup databases.
              This is an appropriate way to back up any remote database.
              The database snapshot that it outputs is suitable to be
              served up directly by <b>ovsdb-server </b>or used as the input to
              <b>ovsdb-client restore</b>.

              Another way to back up a standalone or active-backup
              database is to copy its database file, e.g. with <b>cp</b>.  This
              is safe even if the database is in use.

              The output does not include ephemeral columns, which by
              design do not survive across restarts of <b>ovsdb-server</b>.

       [<b>--force</b>] <b>restore </b>[<i>server</i>] [<i>database</i>] <b>&lt; </b><i>snapshot</i>
              Reads <i>snapshot</i>, which must be a OVSDB standalone or
              active-backup database (possibly but not necessarily
              created by <b>ovsdb-client backup).  Then, connects to</b>
              <i>server</i>, verifies that <i>database</i> and <i>snapshot</i> have the same
              schema, then deletes all of the data in <i>database</i> and
              replaces it by <i>snapshot</i>.  The replacement happens
              atomically, in a single transaction.

              UUIDs for rows in the restored database will differ from
              those in <i>snapshot</i>, because the OVSDB protocol does not
              allow clients to specify row UUIDs.  Another way to
              restore a standalone or active-backup database, which does
              also restore row UUIDs, is to stop the server or servers,
              replace the database file by the snapshot, then restart
              the database.  Either way, ephemeral columns are not
              restored, since by design they do not survive across
              restarts of <b>ovsdb-server</b>.

              Normally <b>restore </b>exits with a failure if <b>snapshot </b>and the
              server's database have different schemas.  In such a case,
              it is a good idea to convert the database to the new
              schema before restoring, e.g. with <b>ovsdb-client convert</b>.
              Use <b>--force </b>to proceed regardless of schema differences
              even though the restore might fail with an error or
              succeed with surprising results.

       <b>monitor </b>[<i>server</i>] [<i>database</i>] <i>table</i> [<i>column</i>[<b>,</b><i>column</i>]...]...
       <b>monitor-cond </b>[<i>server</i>] [<i>database</i>] <i>conditions table</i>
       [<i>column</i>[<b>,</b><i>column</i>]...]...
       <b>monitor-cond-since </b>[<i>server</i>] [<i>database</i>] [<i>last-id</i>] <i>conditions table</i>
       [<i>column</i>[<b>,</b><i>column</i>]...]...
              Connects to <i>server</i> and monitors the contents of rows that
              match conditions in <i>table</i> in <i>database</i>. By default, the
              initial contents of <i>table</i> are printed, followed by each
              change as it occurs.  If conditions empty, all rows will
              be monitored. If at least one <i>column</i> is specified, only
              those columns are monitored.  The following <i>column</i> names
              have special meanings:

              <b>!initial</b>
                     Do not print the initial contents of the specified
                     columns.

              <b>!insert</b>
                     Do not print newly inserted rows.

              <b>!delete</b>
                     Do not print deleted rows.

              <b>!modify</b>
                     Do not print modifications to existing rows.

              Multiple [<i>column</i>[<b>,</b><i>column</i>]...] groups may be specified as
              separate arguments, e.g. to apply different reporting
              parameters to each group.  Whether multiple groups or only
              a single group is specified, any given column may only be
              mentioned once on the command line.

              <b>conditions </b>is a JSON array of &lt;condition&gt; as defined in
              RFC 7047 5.1 with the following change: A condition can be
              either a 3-element JSON array as described in the RFC or a
              boolean value.

              If <b>--detach </b>is used with <b>monitor</b>, <b>monitor-cond </b>or
              <b>monitor-cond-since</b>, then <b>ovsdb-client </b>detaches after it
              has successfully received and printed the initial contents
              of <i>table</i>.

              The <b>monitor </b>command uses RFC 7047 "monitor" method to open
              a monitor session with the server. The <b>monitor-cond </b>and
              <b>monitor-cond-since </b>commandls uses RFC 7047 extension
              "monitor_cond" and "monitor_cond_since" methods. See
              <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ovsdb-server.1.html">ovsdb-server(1)</a> for details.

       <b>monitor </b>[<i>server</i>] [<i>database</i>] <b>ALL</b>
              Connects to <i>server</i> and monitors the contents of all tables
              in <i>database</i>.  Prints initial values and all kinds of
              changes to all columns in the database.  The <b>--detach</b>
              option causes <b>ovsdb-client </b>to detach after it successfully
              receives and prints the initial database contents.

              The <b>monitor </b>command uses RFC 7047 "monitor" method to open
              a monitor session with the server.

       <b>wait </b>[<i>server</i>] <i>database state</i>
              Waits for <i>database</i> on <i>server</i> to enter a desired <i>state</i>,
              which may be one of:

              <b>added  </b>Waits until a database with the given name has been
                     added to <i>server</i>.

              <b>connected</b>
                     Waits until a database with the given name has been
                     added to <i>server</i>.  Then, if <i>database</i> is clustered,
                     additionally waits until it has joined and
                     connected to its cluster.

              <b>removed</b>
                     Waits until <i>database</i> has been removed from the
                     database server.  This can also be used to wait for
                     a database to complete leaving its cluster, because
                     <b>ovsdb-server </b>removes a database at that point.

              <i>database</i> is mandatory for this command because it is often
              used to check for databases that have not yet been added
              to the server, so that the <b>ovsdb-client </b>semantics of
              acting on a default database do not work.

              This command acts on a particular database server, not on
              a cluster, so <i>server</i> must name a single server, not a
              comma-delimited list of servers.

   <b>Testing commands</b>
       These commands are mostly of interest for testing the correctness
       of the OVSDB server.

       <b>lock </b>[<i>server</i>] <i>lock</i>
       <b>steal </b>[<i>server</i>] <i>lock</i>
       <b>unlock </b>[<i>server</i>] <i>lock</i>
              Connects to <i>server</i> and issues corresponding RFC 7047 lock
              operations on <i>lock</i>. Prints json reply or subsequent update
              messages.  The <b>--detach </b>option causes <b>ovsdb-client </b>to
              detach after it successfully receives and prints the
              initial reply.

              When running with the <b>--detach </b>option, <b>lock</b>, <b>steal</b>, <b>unlock</b>
              and <b>exit </b>commands can be issued by using <b>ovs-appctl</b>. <b>exit</b>
              command causes the <b>ovsdb-client </b>to close its <b>ovsdb-server</b>
              connection before exit.  The <b>lock</b>, <b>steal </b>and <b>unlock</b>
              commands can be used to issue additional lock operations
              over the same <b>ovsdb-server </b>connection. All above commands
              take a single <i>lock</i> argument, which does not have to be the
              same as the <i>lock</i> that <b>ovsdb-client </b>started with.
