       The TAPRIO qdisc implements a simplified version of the
       scheduling state machine defined by IEEE 802.1Q-2018 Section
       8.6.9, which allows configuration of a sequence of gate states,
       where each gate state allows outgoing traffic for a subset
       (potentially empty) of traffic classes.

       How traffic is mapped to different hardware queues is similar to
       <b>mqprio</b>(8) and so the <b>map </b>and <b>queues </b>parameters have the same
       meaning.

       The other parameters specify the schedule, and at what point in
       time it should start (it can behave as the schedule started in
       the past).
