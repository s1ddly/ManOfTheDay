       <b>ippevepcl </b>and <b>ippeveps </b>are print commands for <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ippeveprinter.1.html">ippeveprinter(1)</a>.
       As with all print commands, these commands read either the
       filename specified on the command-line or from the standard
       input.  Output is sent to the standard output.  Status and
       progress messages are sent to the standard error.

       <b>ippevepcl </b>prints to B&amp;W HP PCL laser printers and supports
       printing of HP PCL (application/vnd.hp-pcl), PWG Raster
       (image/pwg-raster), and Apple Raster (image/urf) print files.

       <b>ippeveps </b>print to Adobe PostScript printers and supports printing
       of PDF (application/pdf), PostScript (application/postscript),
       JPEG (image/jpeg), PWG Raster (image/pwg-raster), and Apple
       Raster (image/urf) print files.  Printer-specific commands are
       read from a supplied PPD file.  If no PPD file is specified,
       generic commands suitable for any Level 2 or Level 3 PostScript
       printer are used instead to specify duplex printing and media
       size.
