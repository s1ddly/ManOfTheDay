       Runs a build command in a directory.  DIRECTORY must have been
       initialized with <b>flatpak build-init</b>.

       The sdk that is specified in the metadata file in the directory
       is mounted at /usr and the files and var subdirectories are
       mounted at /app and /var, respectively. They are writable, and
       their contents are preserved between build commands, to allow
       accumulating build artifacts there.
