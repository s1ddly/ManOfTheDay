       <b>mysql_setpermission </b>is a Perl script that was originally written
       and contributed by Luuk de Boer. It interactively sets
       permissions in the MariaDB grant tables.  <b>mysql_setpermission </b>is
       written in Perl and requires that the DBI and DBD::MariaDB Perl
       modules be installed.

       Invoke <b>mysql_setpermission </b>like this:

           shell&gt; <b>mysql_setpermission [</b><i>options</i><b>]</b>

       <i>options</i> should be either <b>--help </b>to display the help message, or
       options that indicate how to connect to the MariaDB server. The
       account used when you connect determines which permissions you
       have when attempting to modify existing permissions in the grant
       tables.

       <b>mysql_setpermission </b>also reads options from the [client] and
       [perl] groups in the .my.cnf file in your home directory, if the
       file exists.

       <b>mysql_setpermission </b>supports the following options:

       •   <b>--help</b>

           Display a help message and exit.

       •   <b>--host=</b><i>host_name</i>

           Connect to the MariaDB server on the given host.

       •   <b>--password=</b><i>password</i>

           The password to use when connecting to the server. Note that
           the password value is not optional for this option, unlike
           for other MariaDB programs.

           Specifying a password on the command line should be
           considered insecure. You can use an option file to avoid
           giving the password on the command line.

       •   <b>--port=</b><i>port_num</i>

           The TCP/IP port number to use for the connection.

       •   <b>--socket=</b><i>path</i>

           For connections to localhost, the Unix socket file to use.

       •   <b>--user=</b><i>user_name</i>

           The MariaDB user name to use when connecting to the server.
