       <b>systemd-dissect </b>is a tool for introspecting and interacting with
       file system OS disk images. It supports four different
       operations:

        1. Show general OS image information, including the image's
           <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/os-release.5.html">os-release(5)</a> data, machine ID, partition information and
           more.

        2. Mount an OS image to a local directory. In this mode it will
           dissect the OS image and mount the included partitions
           according to their designation onto a directory and possibly
           sub-directories.

        3. Copy files and directories in and out of an OS image.

       The tool may operate on three types of OS images:

        1. OS disk images containing a GPT partition table envelope,
           with partitions marked according to the <b>Discoverable</b>
           <b>Partitions Specification</b><b></b>[1].

        2. OS disk images containing just a plain file-system without an
           enveloping partition table. (This file system is assumed to
           be the root file system of the OS.)

        3. OS disk images containing a GPT or MBR partition table, with
           a single partition only. (This partition is assumed to
           contain the root file system of the OS.)

       OS images may use any kind of Linux-supported file systems. In
       addition they may make use of LUKS disk encryption, and contain
       Verity integrity information. Note that qualifying OS images may
       be booted with <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/systemd-nspawn.1.html">systemd-nspawn(1)</a>'s <b>--image= </b>switch, and be used
       as root file system for system service using the <i>RootImage=</i> unit
       file setting, see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/systemd.exec.5.html">systemd.exec(5)</a>.

       Note that the partition table shown when invoked without command
       switch (as listed below) does not necessarily show all partitions
       included in the image, but just the partitions that are
       understood and considered part of an OS disk image. Specifically,
       partitions of unknown types are ignored, as well as duplicate
       partitions (i.e. more than one per partition type), as are root
       and /usr/ partitions of architectures not compatible with the
       local system. In other words: this tool will display what it
       operates with when mounting the image. To display the complete
       list of partitions use a tool such as <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/fdisk.8.html">fdisk(8)</a>.
