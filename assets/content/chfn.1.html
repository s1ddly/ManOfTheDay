       <b>chfn </b>is used to change your finger information. This information
       is stored in the <i>/etc/passwd</i> file, and is displayed by the <b>finger</b>
       program. The Linux <b>finger </b>command will display four pieces of
       information that can be changed by <b>chfn</b>: your real name, your
       work room and phone, and your home phone.

       Any of the four pieces of information can be specified on the
       command line. If no information is given on the command line,
       <b>chfn </b>enters interactive mode.

       In interactive mode, <b>chfn </b>will prompt for each field. At a
       prompt, you can enter the new information, or just press return
       to leave the field unchanged. Enter the keyword "none" to make
       the field blank.

       <b>chfn </b>supports non-local entries (kerberos, LDAP, etc.) if linked
       with libuser, otherwise use <b>ypchfn</b>(1), <b>lchfn</b>(1) or any other
       implementation for non-local entries.
