       The <i>stap</i> program is the front-end to the Systemtap tool.  It
       accepts probing instructions written in a simple domain-specific
       language, translates those instructions into C code, compiles
       this C code, and loads the resulting module into a running Linux
       kernel or a Dyninst user-space mutator, to perform the requested
       system trace/probe functions.  You can supply the script in a
       named file (FILENAME), from standard input (use - instead of
       FILENAME), or from the command line (using -e SCRIPT).  The
       program runs until it is interrupted by the user, or if the
       script voluntarily invokes the <i>exit()</i> function, or by sufficient
       number of soft errors.

       The language, which is described the <i>SCRIPT LANGUAGE</i> section
       below, is strictly typed, expressive, declaration free,
       procedural, prototyping-friendly, and inspired by <i>awk</i> and <i>C</i>.  It
       allows source code points or events in the system to be
       associated with handlers, which are subroutines that are executed
       synchronously.  It is somewhat similar conceptually to
       "breakpoint command lists" in the <i>gdb</i> debugger.
