       <b>nstat </b>and <b>rtacct </b>are simple tools to monitor kernel snmp counters
       and network interface statistics.

       <b>nstat </b>can filter kernel snmp counters by name with one or several
       specified wildcards. Wildcards are case-insensitive and can
       include special symbols <b>?  </b>and <b>*</b>
