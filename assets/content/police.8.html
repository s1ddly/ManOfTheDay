       The <b>police </b>action allows limiting of the byte or packet rate of
       traffic matched by the filter it is attached to.

       There are two different algorithms available to measure the byte
       rate: The first one uses an internal dual token bucket and is
       configured using the <b>rate</b>, <b>burst</b>, <b>mtu</b>, <b>peakrate</b>, <b>overhead </b>and
       <b>linklayer </b>parameters. The second one uses an in-kernel sampling
       mechanism. It can be fine-tuned using the <b>estimator </b>filter
       parameter.

       There is one algorithm available to measure packet rate and it is
       similar to the first algorithm described for byte rate. It is
       configured using the <b>pkt_rate </b>and <b>pkt_burst </b>parameters.

       At least one of the <b>rate </b>and <b>pkt_rate </b>parameters must be
       configured.
