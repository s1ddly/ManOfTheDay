       <b>dh_installsystemd </b>is a debhelper program that is responsible for
       installing package maintainer supplied systemd unit files.

       It also finds the service files installed by a package and
       generates <i>preinst</i>, <i>postinst</i>, and <i>prerm</i> code blocks for enabling,
       disabling, starting, stopping, and restarting the corresponding
       systemd services, when the package is installed, updated, or
       removed. These snippets are added to the maintainer scripts by
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dh_installdeb.1.html">dh_installdeb(1)</a>.

       <b>deb-systemd-helper</b>(1) is used to enable and disable systemd
       units, thus it is not necessary that the machine actually runs
       systemd during package installation time, enabling happens on all
       machines in order to be able to switch from sysvinit to systemd
       and back.

       <b>dh_installsystemd </b>operates on all unit files installed by a
       package. For only generating blocks for specific unit files, pass
       them as arguments, "dh_installsystemd quota.service". Specific
       unit files can be excluded from processing using the <b>-X </b>common
       <b>debhelper</b>(1) option.
