<pre>
       This is an implementation of the Lightweight User Datagram
       Protocol (UDP-Lite), as described in RFC 3828.

       UDP-Lite is an extension of UDP (RFC 768) to support variable-
       length checksums.  This has advantages for some types of
       multimedia transport that may be able to make use of slightly
       damaged datagrams, rather than having them discarded by lower-
       layer protocols.

       The variable-length checksum coverage is set via a <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setsockopt.2.html">setsockopt(2)</a>
       option.  If this option is not set, the only difference from UDP
       is in using a different IP protocol identifier (IANA number 136).

       The UDP-Lite implementation is a full extension of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/udp.7.html">udp(7)</a>â€”that
       is, it shares the same API and API behavior, and in addition
       offers two socket options to control the checksum coverage.

   <b>Address format</b>
       UDP-Litev4 uses the <i>sockaddr_in</i> address format described in
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/ip.7.html">ip(7)</a>.  UDP-Litev6 uses the <i>sockaddr_in6</i> address format described
       in <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/ipv6.7.html">ipv6(7)</a>.

   <b>Socket options</b>
       To set or get a UDP-Lite socket option, call <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getsockopt.2.html">getsockopt(2)</a> to
       read or <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setsockopt.2.html">setsockopt(2)</a> to write the option with the option level
       argument set to <b>IPPROTO_UDPLITE</b>.  In addition, all <b>IPPROTO_UDP</b>
       socket options are valid on a UDP-Lite socket.  See <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/udp.7.html">udp(7)</a> for
       more information.

       The following two options are specific to UDP-Lite.

       <b>UDPLITE_SEND_CSCOV</b>
              This option sets the sender checksum coverage and takes an
              <i>int</i> as argument, with a checksum coverage value in the
              range 0..2^16-1.

              A value of 0 means that the entire datagram is always
              covered.  Values from 1-7 are illegal (RFC 3828, 3.1) and
              are rounded up to the minimum coverage of 8.

              With regard to IPv6 jumbograms (RFC 2675), the UDP-Litev6
              checksum coverage is limited to the first 2^16-1 octets,
              as per RFC 3828, 3.5.  Higher values are therefore
              silently truncated to 2^16-1.  If in doubt, the current
              coverage value can always be queried using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getsockopt.2.html">getsockopt(2)</a>.

       <b>UDPLITE_RECV_CSCOV</b>
              This is the receiver-side analogue and uses the same
              argument format and value range as <b>UDPLITE_SEND_CSCOV</b>.
              This option is not required to enable traffic with partial
              checksum coverage.  Its function is that of a traffic
              filter: when enabled, it instructs the kernel to drop all
              packets which have a coverage <i>less</i> than the specified
              coverage value.

              When the value of <b>UDPLITE_RECV_CSCOV </b>exceeds the actual
              packet coverage, incoming packets are silently dropped,
              but may generate a warning message in the system log.
