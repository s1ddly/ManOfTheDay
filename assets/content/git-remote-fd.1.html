       This helper uses specified file descriptors to connect to a
       remote Git server. This is not meant for end users but for
       programs and scripts calling git fetch, push or archive.

       If only &lt;infd&gt; is given, it is assumed to be a bidirectional
       socket connected to remote Git server (git-upload-pack,
       git-receive-pack or git-upload-archive). If both &lt;infd&gt; and
       &lt;outfd&gt; are given, they are assumed to be pipes connected to a
       remote Git server (&lt;infd&gt; being the inbound pipe and &lt;outfd&gt;
       being the outbound pipe.

       It is assumed that any handshaking procedures have already been
       completed (such as sending service request for git://) before
       this helper is started.

       &lt;anything&gt; can be any string. It is ignored. It is meant for
       providing information to user in the URL in case that URL is
       displayed in some context.
