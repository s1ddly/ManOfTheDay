       <b>pcp-dmcache </b>reports on the activity of any configured Device
       Mapper Cache targets.  The reported information includes device
       IOPs, cache and metadata device utilization, as well as hit and
       miss rates and ratios for both reads and writes for each cache
       device.

       <b>pcp-lvmcache </b>(Logical Volume Manager cache) is an exact synonym
       for <b>pcp-dmcache </b>(Device Mapper cache).

       By default, <b>pcp-dmcache </b>reports on all available cache target
       devices (one line each, per sample), but this can be restricted
       to specific devices on the command line.
