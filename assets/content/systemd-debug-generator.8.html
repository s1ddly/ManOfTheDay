       systemd-debug-generator is a generator that reads the kernel
       command line and understands three options:

       If the <b>systemd.mask= </b>or <b>rd.systemd.mask= </b>option is specified and
       followed by a unit name, this unit is masked for the runtime,
       similar to the effect of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/systemctl.1.html">systemctl(1)</a>'s <b>mask </b>command. This is
       useful to boot with certain units removed from the initial boot
       transaction for debugging system startup. May be specified more
       than once.  <b>rd.systemd.mask= </b>is honored only by initial RAM disk
       (initrd) while <b>systemd.mask= </b>is honored only in the main system.

       If the <b>systemd.wants= </b>or <b>rd.systemd.wants= </b>option is specified
       and followed by a unit name, a start job for this unit is added
       to the initial transaction. This is useful to start one or more
       additional units at boot. May be specified more than once.
       <b>rd.systemd.wants= </b>is honored only by initial RAM disk (initrd)
       while <b>systemd.wants= </b>is honored only in the main system.

       If the <b>systemd.debug_shell </b>or <b>rd.systemd.debug_shell </b>option is
       specified, the debug shell service "debug-shell.service" is
       pulled into the boot transaction and a debug shell will be
       spawned during early boot. By default, /dev/tty9 is used, but a
       specific tty can also be set, either with or without the /dev/
       prefix. Note that the shell may also be turned on persistently by
       enabling it with <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/systemctl.1.html">systemctl(1)</a>'s <b>enable </b>command.
       <b>rd.systemd.debug_shell= </b>is honored only by initial RAM disk
       (initrd) while <b>systemd.debug_shell </b>is honored only in the main
       system.

       systemd-debug-generator implements <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/systemd.generator.7.html">systemd.generator(7)</a>.
