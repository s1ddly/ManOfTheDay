       <b>lpadmin </b>configures printer and class queues provided by CUPS.  It
       can also be used to set the server default printer or class.

       When specified before the <i>-d</i>, <i>-p</i>, or <i>-x</i> options, the <i>-E</i> option
       forces encryption when connecting to the server.

       The first form of the command (<i>-d</i>) sets the default printer or
       class to <i>destination</i>.  Subsequent print jobs submitted via the
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/lp.1.html">lp(1)</a> or <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/lpr.1.html">lpr(1)</a> commands will use this destination unless the
       user specifies otherwise with the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/lpoptions.1.html">lpoptions(1)</a> command.

       The second form of the command (<i>-p</i>) configures the named printer
       or class.  The additional options are described below.

       The third form of the command (<i>-x</i>) deletes the printer or class
       <i>destination</i>.  Any jobs that are pending for the destination will
       be removed and any job that is currently printed will be aborted.
