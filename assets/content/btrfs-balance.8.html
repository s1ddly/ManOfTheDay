       The primary purpose of the balance feature is to spread block
       groups across all devices so they match constraints defined by
       the respective profiles. See <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/mkfs.btrfs.8.html">mkfs.btrfs(8)</a> section <i>PROFILES</i> for
       more details. The scope of the balancing process can be further
       tuned by use of filters that can select the block groups to
       process. Balance works only on a mounted filesystem. Extent
       sharing is preserved and reflinks are not broken. Files are not
       defragmented nor recompressed, file extents are preserved but the
       physical location on devices will change.

       The balance operation is cancellable by the user. The on-disk
       state of the filesystem is always consistent so an unexpected
       interruption (eg. system crash, reboot) does not corrupt the
       filesystem. The progress of the balance operation is temporarily
       stored as an internal state and will be resumed upon mount,
       unless the mount option <i>skip_balance</i> is specified.

           <b>Warning</b>
           running balance without filters will take a lot of time as it
           basically move data/metadata from the whol filesystem and
           needs to update all block pointers.

       The filters can be used to perform following actions:

       •   convert block group profiles (filter <i>convert</i>)

       •   make block group usage more compact (filter <i>usage</i>)

       •   perform actions only on a given device (filters <i>devid</i>,
           <i>drange</i>)

       The filters can be applied to a combination of block group types
       (data, metadata, system). Note that changing only the <i>system</i> type
       needs the force option. Otherwise <i>system</i> gets automatically
       converted whenever <i>metadata</i> profile is converted.

       When metadata redundancy is reduced (eg. from RAID1 to single)
       the force option is also required and it is noted in system log.

           <b>Note</b>
           the balance operation needs enough work space, ie. space that
           is completely unused in the filesystem, otherwise this may
           lead to ENOSPC reports. See the section <i>ENOSPC</i> for more
           details.
