<pre>
       The <i>chown</i> utility shall set the user ID of the file named by each
       <i>file</i> operand to the user ID specified by the <i>owner</i> operand.

       For each <i>file</i> operand, or, if the <b>-R </b>option is used, each file
       encountered while walking the directory trees specified by the
       <i>file</i> operands, the <i>chown</i> utility shall perform actions equivalent
       to the <i>chown</i>() function defined in the System Interfaces volume
       of POSIX.1‚Äê2017, called with the following arguments:

        1. The <i>file</i> operand shall be used as the <i>path</i> argument.

        2. The user ID indicated by the <i>owner</i> portion of the first
           operand shall be used as the <i>owner</i> argument.

        3. If the <i>group</i> portion of the first operand is given, the group
           ID indicated by it shall be used as the <i>group</i> argument;
           otherwise, the group ownership shall not be changed.

       Unless <i>chown</i> is invoked by a process with appropriate privileges,
       the set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits of a regular file shall be
       cleared upon successful completion; the set-user-ID and set-
       group-ID bits of other file types may be cleared.
