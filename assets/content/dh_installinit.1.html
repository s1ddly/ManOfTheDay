       <b>dh_installinit </b>is a debhelper program that is responsible for
       installing init scripts with associated defaults files.  In
       compatibility levels up to and including 10, <b>dh_installinit </b>will
       also install some systemd related files provided by the debian
       packaging (see the "FILES" section below).  In compatibility
       levels up to and including 11, <b>dh_installinit </b>will also handle
       upstart jobs provided in the debian packaging (see the "FILES"
       for more information on this as well).

       It also automatically generates the <i>postinst</i> and <i>postrm</i> and <i>prerm</i>
       commands needed to set up the symlinks in <i>/etc/rc*.d/</i> to start
       and stop the init scripts.

       In compat 10 or earlier: If a package only ships a systemd
       service file and no sysvinit script is provided, you may want to
       exclude the call to dh_installinit for that package (e.g. via
       <b>-N</b>).  Otherwise, you may get warnings from lintian about init.d
       scripts not being included in the package.
