     <b>ssh-sk-helper </b>is used by ssh-agent(1) to access keys provided by a
     FIDO authenticator.

     <b>ssh-sk-helper </b>is not intended to be invoked by the user, but from
     ssh-agent(1).

     A single option is supported:

     <b>-v      </b>Verbose mode.  Causes <b>ssh-sk-helper </b>to print debugging
             messages about its progress.  This is helpful in debugging
             problems.  Multiple <b>-v </b>options increase the verbosity.  The
             maximum is 3.

             Note that ssh-agent(1) will automatically pass the <b>-v </b>flag
             to <b>ssh-sk-helper </b>when it has itself been placed in debug
             mode.
