       <b>wg </b>is the configuration utility for getting and setting the
       configuration of WireGuard tunnel interfaces. The interfaces
       themselves can be added and removed using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ip-link.8.html">ip-link(8)</a> and their IP
       addresses and routing tables can be set using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ip-address.8.html">ip-address(8)</a> and
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ip-route.8.html">ip-route(8)</a>.  The <b>wg </b>utility provides a series of sub-commands
       for changing WireGuard-specific aspects of WireGuard interfaces.

       If no COMMAND is specified, COMMAND defaults to <b>show</b>.  Sub-
       commands that take an INTERFACE must be passed a WireGuard
       interface.
