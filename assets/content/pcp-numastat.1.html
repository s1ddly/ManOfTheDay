       <b>pcp-numastat </b>displays NUMA allocation statistics from the kernel
       memory allocator.  Each process has NUMA policies that specify on
       which node pages are allocated.  The performance counters in the
       kernel track on which nodes memory is allocated and these values
       are sampled and reported by <b>pcp-numastat</b>.

       Counters are maintained individually for each NUMA node.  Details
       of the semantics of each reported metric can be retrieved using
       the following command:

            # pminfo ‚Äêdt mem.numa.alloc
