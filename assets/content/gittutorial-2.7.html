       You should work through <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/gittutorial.7.html">gittutorial(7)</a> before reading this
       tutorial.

       The goal of this tutorial is to introduce two fundamental pieces
       of Git’s architecture—the object database and the index file—and
       to provide the reader with everything necessary to understand the
       rest of the Git documentation.
