       <b>rpmbuild </b>is used to build both binary and source software
       packages.  A <b>package </b>consists of an archive of files and meta-
       data used to install and erase the archive files.  The meta-data
       includes helper scripts, file attributes, and descriptive
       information about the package.  <b>Packages </b>come in two varieties:
       binary packages, used to encapsulate software to be installed,
       and source packages, containing the source code and recipe
       necessary to produce binary packages.

       One of the following basic modes must be selected: <b>Build Package</b>,
       <b>Build Package from Tarball</b>, <b>Recompile Package</b>, <b>Show</b>
       <b>Configuration</b>.

   <b>GENERAL OPTIONS</b>
       These options can be used in all the different modes.

       <b>-?, --help</b>
              Print a longer usage message then normal.

       <b>--version</b>
              Print a single line containing the version number of <b>rpm</b>
              being used.

       <b>--quiet</b>
              Print as little as possible - normally only error messages
              will be displayed.

       <b>-v     </b>Print verbose information - normally routine progress
              messages will be displayed.

       <b>-vv    </b>Print lots of ugly debugging information.

       <b>--rpmfcdebug</b>
              Enables to debug dependencies generation.

       <b>--rcfile </b><i>FILELIST</i>
              Each of the files in the colon separated <i>FILELIST</i> is read
              sequentially by <b>rpm </b>for configuration information.  Only
              the first file in the list must exist, and tildes will be
              expanded to the value of <b>$HOME</b>.  The default <i>FILELIST</i> is
              <i>/usr/lib/rpm/rpmrc</i>:<i>/usr/lib/rpm/&lt;vendor&gt;/rpmrc</i>:<i>/etc/rpmrc</i>:<i>~/.rpmrc</i>.

       <b>--pipe </b><i>CMD</i>
              Pipes the output of <b>rpm </b>to the command <i>CMD</i>.

       <b>--dbpath </b><i>DIRECTORY</i>
              Use the database in <i>DIRECTORY</i> rather than the default path
              <i>/var/lib/rpm</i>

       <b>--root </b><i>DIRECTORY</i>
              Use the file system tree rooted at <i>DIRECTORY</i> for all
              operations.  Note that this means the database within
              <i>DIRECTORY</i> will be used for dependency checks and any
              scriptlet(s) (e.g. <b>%post </b>if installing, or <b>%prep </b>if
              building, a package) will be run after a chroot(2) to
              <i>DIRECTORY</i>.

       <b>-D, --define='</b><i>MACRO EXPR</i><b>'</b>
              Defines <i>MACRO</i> with value <i>EXPR</i>.

       <b>--scm=</b><i>SCM</i>
              Select the <i>SCM</i> to use with %autosetup, if one is not set
              in the spec file.  Note that not all values for <i>SCM</i>, e.g.,
              <b>patch </b>(the default) and <b>gendiff</b>, <b>git</b>, or <b>quilt </b>work
              interchangeably with all other patches and options stated
              in the %autosetup line, especially option <b>-p</b><i>N</i>.

   <b>BUILD OPTIONS</b>
       The general form of an rpm build command is

       <b>rpmbuild </b>{<b>-b</b><i>STAGE</i><b>|-r</b><i>STAGE</i><b>|-t</b><i>STAGE</i>} [<b>rpmbuild-options</b>] <i>FILE ...</i>

       The argument used is <b>-b </b>if a spec file is being used to build the
       package, <b>-r </b>if a source package is to be rebuilt and <b>-t </b>if
       <b>rpmbuild </b>should look inside of a (possibly compressed) tar file
       for the spec file to use.

       Packages are built in a number of stages.  The first six
       correspond to the following sections in a spec file: <b>%prep</b>,
       <b>%generate_buildrequires</b>, <b>%build</b>, <b>%install</b>, <b>%check </b>and <b>%clean</b>.
       Finally, binary and source packages are created in an assembly
       stage.

       The <i>STAGE</i> character specifies the stage to finish with (after
       doing all the stages preceding it), and is one of:

       <b>-ba    </b>Perform a full build - executes up to and including the
              assembly stage.  In most cases, this is the option to
              choose.

       <b>-bb    </b>Build just the binary packages - executes up to and
              including the assembly stage, but without creating the
              source package.

       <b>-bp    </b>Unpack the sources and apply any patches - executes the
              %prep stage only.

       <b>-bc    </b>Compile the sources - executes up to and including the
              %build stage.  This generally involves the equivalent of a
              "make".

       <b>-bi    </b>Install the binaries into the build root - executes up to
              and including the %check stage.  This generally involves
              the equivalent of a "make install" and "make check".

       <b>-bl    </b>Do a "list check" - the %files section from the spec file
              is macro expanded, and checks are made to verify that each
              file exists.

       <b>-bs    </b>Build just the source package - skips straight to the
              assembly stage, without executing any of the preceding
              stages or creating binary packages.

       <b>-br    </b>Build just the source package, but also parse and include
              dynamic build dependencies - executes up to and including
              the %generate_buildrequires stage and then skips straight
              to the assembly stage, without creating binary packages.
              This command can be used to fully resolve dynamic build
              dependencies.  See the DYNAMIC BUILD DEPENDENCIES section
              for details.

       The following options may also be used:

       <b>--buildroot </b><i>DIRECTORY</i>
              When building a package, override the BuildRoot tag with
              directory <i>DIRECTORY</i>.

       <b>--clean</b>
              Remove the build tree after the packages are made.

       <b>--nobuild</b>
              Do not execute any build stages.  Useful for testing out
              spec files.

       <b>--noprep</b>
              Do not execute %prep build stage even if present in spec.

       <b>--noclean</b>
              Do not execute %clean build stage even if present in spec.

       <b>--nocheck</b>
              Do not execute %check build stage even if present in spec.

       <b>--nodebuginfo</b>
              Do not generate debuginfo packages.

       <b>--nodeps</b>
              Do not verify build dependencies.

       <b>--rmsource</b>
              Remove the sources after the build (may also be used
              standalone, e.g. "<b>rpmbuild --rmsource foo.spec</b>").

       <b>--rmspec</b>
              Remove the spec file after the build (may also be used
              standalone, eg.  "<b>rpmbuild --rmspec foo.spec</b>").

       <b>--short-circuit</b>
              Skip straight to specified stage (i.e., skip all stages
              leading up to the specified stage).  Only valid with <b>-bc</b>,
              <b>-bi</b>, and <b>-bb</b>.  Useful for local testing only.  Packages
              built this way will be marked with an unsatisfiable
              dependency to prevent their accidental use.

       <b>--build-in-place</b>
              Build from locally checked out sources.  Sets _builddir to
              current working directory.  Skips handling of -n and untar
              in the %setup and the deletion of the buildSubdir.

       <b>--target </b><i>PLATFORM</i>
              When building the package, interpret <i>PLATFORM</i> as <b>arch-</b>
              <b>vendor-os </b>and set the macros <b>%_target</b>, <b>%_target_cpu</b>, and
              <b>%_target_os </b>accordingly.

       <b>--with </b><i>OPTION</i>
              Enable configure <i>OPTION</i> for build.

       <b>--without </b><i>OPTION</i>
              Disable configure <i>OPTION</i> for build.

   <b>REBUILD AND RECOMPILE OPTIONS</b>
       There are two other ways to invoke building with rpm:

       <b>rpmbuild --rebuild|--recompile </b><i>SOURCEPKG ...</i>

       When invoked this way, <b>rpmbuild </b>installs the named source
       package, and does a prep, compile and install.  In addition,
       <b>--rebuild </b>builds a new binary package.  When the build has
       completed, the build directory is removed (as in <b>--clean</b>) and the
       the sources and spec file for the package are removed.

       These options are now superseded by the <b>-r* </b>options which allow
       much more fine control over what stages of the build to run.

   <b>DYNAMIC BUILD DEPENDENCIES</b>
       When the %generate_buildrequires stage runs and some of the newly
       generated BuildRequires are not satisfied, <b>rpmbuild </b>creates an
       intermediate source package ending in <i>buildreqs.nosrc.rpm</i>, which
       has the new BuildRequires, and exits with code 11.  This package
       can then be used in place of the original source package to
       resolve and install the missing build dependencies in the usual
       way, such as with <b>dnf-builddep(8)</b>.

       Multiple layers of dynamic build dependencies may exist in a spec
       file; the presence of specific BuildRequires on the system may
       yield new BuildRequires next time a build is performed with the
       same source package.  The easiest way to ensure that all dynamic
       build dependencies are satisfied is to run the <b>-br </b>command,
       install the new dependencies of the <i>buildreqs.nosrc.rpm</i> package
       and repeat the whole procedure until <b>rpmbuild </b>no longer exits
       with code 11.

       If the <b>-br </b>command is coupled with <b>--nodeps</b>, exit code 11 is
       always returned and a <i>buildreqs.nosrc.rpm</i> package is always
       created.

   <b>SHOWRC</b>
       The command

       <b>rpmbuild --showrc</b>

       shows the values <b>rpmbuild </b>will use for all of the options are
       currently set in <i>rpmrc</i> and <i>macros</i> configuration file(s).
