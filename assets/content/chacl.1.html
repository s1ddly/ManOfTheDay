       <i>chacl</i> is an IRIX-compatibility command, and is maintained for
       those users who are familiar with its use from either XFS or
       IRIX.  Refer to the <b>SEE ALSO </b>section below for a description of
       tools which conform more closely to the (withdrawn draft) POSIX
       1003.1e standard which describes Access Control Lists (ACLs).

       <i>chacl</i> changes the ACL(s) for a file or directory.  The ACL(s)
       specified are applied to each file in the <i><b>pathname</b> </i>arguments.

       Each ACL is a string which is interpreted using the
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/acl_from_text.3.html">acl_from_text(3)</a> routine.  These strings are made up of comma
       separated clauses each of which is of the form, tag:name:perm.
       Where <i><b>tag</b> </i>can be:

       "user" (or "u")
              indicating that the entry is a user ACL entry.

       "group" (or "g")
              indicating that the entry is a group ACL entry.

       "other" (or "o")
              indicating that the entry is an other ACL entry.

       "mask" (or "m")
              indicating that the entry is a mask ACL entry.

       <i><b>name</b> </i>is a string which is the user or group name for the ACL
       entry.  A null <i><b>name</b> </i>in a user or group ACL entry indicates the
       file's owner or file's group.  <i><b>perm</b> </i>is the string "rwx" where
       each of the entries may be replaced by a "-" indicating no access
       of that type, e.g. "r-x", "--x", "---".
