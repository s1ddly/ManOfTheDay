       <b>mkfs.xfs </b>constructs an XFS filesystem by writing on a special
       file using the values found in the arguments of the command line.
       It is invoked automatically by <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/mkfs.8.html">mkfs(8)</a> when it is given the <b>-t</b>
       <b>xfs </b>option.

       In its simplest (and most commonly used form), the size of the
       filesystem is determined from the disk driver.  As an example, to
       make a filesystem with an internal log on the first partition on
       the first SCSI disk, use:

              <b>mkfs.xfs /dev/sda1</b>

       The metadata log can be placed on another device to reduce the
       number of disk seeks.  To create a filesystem on the first
       partition on the first SCSI disk with a 10MiB log located on the
       first partition on the second SCSI disk, use:

              <b>mkfs.xfs -l logdev=/dev/sdb1,size=10m /dev/sda1</b>

       Each of the <i>option</i> elements in the argument list above can be
       given as multiple comma-separated suboptions if multiple
       suboptions apply to the same option.  Equivalently, each main
       option can be given multiple times with different suboptions.
       For example, <b>-l internal,size=10m </b>and <b>-l internal -l size=10m </b>are
       equivalent.

       In the descriptions below, sizes are given in sectors, bytes,
       blocks, kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes, etc.  Sizes are treated
       as hexadecimal if prefixed by 0x or 0X, octal if prefixed by 0,
       or decimal otherwise.  The following lists possible
       multiplication suffixes:
              <b>s </b>- multiply by sector size (default = 512, see <b>-s </b>option
                     below).
              <b>b </b>- multiply by filesystem block size (default = 4K, see
                     <b>-b </b>option below).
              <b>k </b>- multiply by one kilobyte (1,024 bytes).
              <b>m </b>- multiply by one megabyte (1,048,576 bytes).
              <b>g </b>- multiply by one gigabyte (1,073,741,824 bytes).
              <b>t </b>- multiply by one terabyte (1,099,511,627,776 bytes).
              <b>p </b>- multiply by one petabyte (1,024 terabytes).
              <b>e </b>- multiply by one exabyte (1,048,576 terabytes).

       When specifying parameters in units of sectors or filesystem
       blocks, the <b>-s </b>option or the <b>-b </b>option may be used to specify the
       size of the sector or block.  If the size of the block or sector
       is not specified, the default sizes (block: 4KiB, sector: 512B)
       will be used.

       Many feature options allow an optional argument of 0 or 1, to
       explicitly disable or enable the functionality.
