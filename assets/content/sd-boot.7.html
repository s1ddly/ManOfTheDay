       <b>systemd-boot </b>(short: <b>sd-boot</b>) is a simple UEFI boot manager. It
       provides a graphical menu to select the entry to boot and an
       editor for the kernel command line.  <b>systemd-boot </b>supports
       systems with UEFI firmware only.

       <b>systemd-boot </b>loads boot entry information from the EFI system
       partition (ESP), usually mounted at /efi/, /boot/, or /boot/efi/
       during OS runtime, as well as from the Extended Boot Loader
       partition if it exists (usually mounted to /boot/). Configuration
       file fragments, kernels, initrds and other EFI images to boot
       generally need to reside on the ESP or the Extended Boot Loader
       partition. Linux kernels must be built with <b>CONFIG_EFI_STUB </b>to be
       able to be directly executed as an EFI image. During boot
       <b>systemd-boot </b>automatically assembles a list of boot entries from
       the following sources:

       •   Boot entries defined with <b>Boot Loader Specification</b><b></b>[1]
           description files located in /loader/entries/ on the ESP and
           the Extended Boot Loader Partition. These usually describe
           Linux kernel images with associated initrd images, but
           alternatively may also describe arbitrary other EFI
           executables.

       •   Unified kernel images following the <b>Boot Loader</b>
           <b>Specification</b><b></b>[1], as executable EFI binaries in /EFI/Linux/
           on the ESP and the Extended Boot Loader Partition.

       •   The Microsoft Windows EFI boot manager, if installed

       •   The Apple macOS boot manager, if installed

       •   The EFI Shell binary, if installed

       •   A reboot into the UEFI firmware setup option, if supported by
           the firmware

       <b>systemd-boot </b>supports the following features:

       •   Basic boot manager configuration changes (such as timeout
           configuration, default boot entry selection, ...) may be made
           directly from the boot loader UI at boot-time, as well as
           during system runtime with EFI variables.

       •   The boot manager integrates with the <b>systemctl </b>command to
           implement features such as <b>systemctl reboot</b>
           <b>--boot-loader-entry=...  </b>(for rebooting into a specific boot
           menu entry, i.e. "reboot into Windows") and <b>systemctl reboot</b>
           <b>--boot-loader-menu=...  </b>(for rebooting into the boot loader
           menu), by implementing the <b>Boot Loader Interface</b><b></b>[2]. See
           <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/systemctl.1.html">systemctl(1)</a> for details.

       •   An EFI variable set by the boot loader informs the OS about
           the EFI System Partition used during boot. This is then used
           to automatically mount the correct EFI System Partition to
           /efi/ or /boot/ during OS runtime. See
           <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/systemd-gpt-auto-generator.8.html">systemd-gpt-auto-generator(8)</a> for details.

       •   The boot manager provides information about the boot time
           spent in UEFI firmware using the <b>Boot Loader Interface</b><b></b>[2].
           This information can be displayed using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/systemd-analyze.1.html">systemd-analyze(1)</a>.

       •   The boot manager implements boot counting and automatic
           fallback to older, working boot entries on failure. See
           <b>Automatic Boot Assessment</b><b></b>[3].

       •   The boot manager optionally reads a random seed from the ESP
           partition, combines it with a 'system token' stored in a
           persistent EFI variable and derives a random seed to use by
           the OS as entropy pool initialization, providing a full
           entropy pool during early boot.

       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/bootctl.1.html">bootctl(1)</a> may be used from a running system to locate the ESP
       and the Extended Boot Loader Partition, list available entries,
       and install <b>systemd-boot </b>itself.

       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/kernel-install.8.html">kernel-install(8)</a> may be used to copy kernel images onto the ESP
       or the Extended Boot Loader Partition and to generate description
       files compliant with the Boot Loader Specification.
