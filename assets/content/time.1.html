       The <b>time </b>command runs the specified program <i>command</i> with the
       given arguments.  When <i>command</i> finishes, <b>time </b>writes a message to
       standard error giving timing statistics about this program run.
       These statistics consist of (i) the elapsed real time between
       invocation and termination, (ii) the user CPU time (the sum of
       the <i>tms_utime</i> and <i>tms_cutime</i> values in a <i>struct tms</i> as returned
       by <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/times.2.html">times(2)</a>), and (iii) the system CPU time (the sum of the
       <i>tms_stime</i> and <i>tms_cstime</i> values in a <i>struct tms</i> as returned by
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/times.2.html">times(2)</a>).

       Note: some shells (e.g., <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/bash.1.html">bash(1)</a>) have a built-in <b>time </b>command
       that provides similar information on the usage of time and
       possibly other resources.  To access the real command, you may
       need to specify its pathname (something like <i>/usr/bin/time</i>).
