       <i>xfsdump</i> backs up files and their attributes in a filesystem.  The
       files are dumped to storage media, a regular file, or standard
       output.  Options allow the operator to have all files dumped,
       just files that have changed since a previous dump, or just files
       contained in a list of pathnames.

       The <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/xfsrestore.8.html">xfsrestore(8)</a> utility re-populates a filesystem with the
       contents of the dump.

       Each invocation of <i>xfsdump</i> dumps just one filesystem.  That
       invocation is termed a dump session.  The dump session splits the
       filesystem into one or more dump streams, one per destination.
       The split is done in filesystem inode number (ino) order, at
       boundaries selected to equalize the size of each stream.
       Furthermore, the breakpoints between streams may be in the middle
       of very large files (at extent boundaries) if necessary to
       achieve reasonable stream size equalization.  Each dump stream
       can span several media objects, and a single media object can
       contain several dump streams.  The typical media object is a tape
       cartridge.  The media object records the dump stream as one or
       more media files.  A media file is a self-contained partial dump,
       intended to minimize the impact of media dropouts on the entire
       dump stream at the expense of increasing the time required to
       complete the dump. By default only one media file is written
       unless a media file size is specified using the <b>-d </b>option. Other
       techniques, such as making a second copy of the dump image,
       provide more protection against media failures than multiple
       media files will.

       <i>xfsdump</i> maintains an online dump inventory in
       <i>/var/lib/xfsdump/inventory</i>.  The <b>-I </b>option displays the inventory
       contents hierarchically.  The levels of the hierarchy are:
       filesystem, dump session, stream, and media file.

       The options to <i>xfsdump</i> are:

       <b>-a   </b>Specifies that files for which the Data Migration Facility
            (DMF) has complete offline copies (dual-state files) be
            treated as if they were offline (OFL).  This means that the
            file data will not be dumped by xfsdump, resulting in a
            smaller dump file.  If the file is later restored the file
            data is still accessible through DMF.  If both '-a option'
            and '-z option' are specified, the '-a option' takes
            precedence (see '-z option' below).

       <b>-b </b><i>blocksize</i>
            Specifies the blocksize, in bytes, to be used for the dump.
            The same blocksize must be specified to restore the tape.
            If the <b>-m </b>option is not used, then <b>-b </b>does not need to be
            specified. Instead, a default blocksize of 1Mb will be used.

       <b>-c </b><i>progname</i>
            Use the specified program to alert the operator when a media
            change is required. The alert program is typically a script
            to send a mail or flash a window to draw the operator's
            attention.

       <b>-d </b><i>filesize</i>
            Specifies the size, in megabytes, of dump media files.  If
            not specified, xfsdump will dump data to tape using a single
            media file per media object.  The specified media file size
            may need to be adjusted if, for example, xfsdump cannot fit
            a media file onto a single tape.

       <b>-e   </b>Allow files to be excluded from the dump.  This will cause
            xfsdump to skip files which have the "no dump" file
            attribute set. See the "Excluding individual files" section
            below for details on setting this file attribute.

       <b>-f </b><i>dest</i> [ <b>-f </b><i>dest</i> ... ]
            Specifies a dump destination.  A dump destination can be the
            pathname of a device (such as a tape drive), a regular file
            or a remote tape drive (see <i>rmt</i>(8)).  This option must be
            omitted if the standard output option (a lone <b>- </b>preceding
            the source filesystem specification) is specified.

       <b>-l </b><i>level</i>
            Specifies a dump level of 0 to 9.  The dump level determines
            the base dump to which this dump is relative.  The base dump
            is the most recent dump at a lesser level.  A level 0 dump
            is absolute - all files are dumped.  A dump level where 1 &lt;=
            <i>level</i> &lt;= 9 is referred to as an incremental dump.  Only
            files that have been changed since the base dump are dumped.
            Subtree dumps (see the <b>-s </b>option below) cannot be used as
            the base for incremental dumps.

       <b>-m   </b>Use the minimal tape protocol for non-scsi tape destinations
            or remote tape destinations which are not scsi Linux tape
            drives nor IRIX tape drives.  This option cannot be used
            without specifying a blocksize to be used (see <b>-b </b>option
            above).

       <b>-o   </b>Overwrite the tape. With this option, <i>xfsdump</i> does not read
            the tape first to check the contents. This option may be
            used if <i>xfsdump</i> is unable to determine the block size of a
            tape .

       <b>-p </b><i>interval</i>
            Causes progress reports to be printed at the specified
            interval.  <i>interval</i> is given in seconds.  The progress
            report indicates how many files have been dumped, the total
            number of files to dump, the percentage of data dumped, and
            the elapsed time.

       <b>-q   </b>Destination tape drive is a QIC tape.  QIC tapes only use a
            512 byte blocksize, for which <i>xfsdump</i> must make special
            allowances.

       <b>-s </b><i>pathname</i> [ <b>-s </b><i>pathname</i> ... ]
            Restricts the dump to files contained in the specified
            pathnames (subtrees).  A <i>pathname</i> must be relative to the
            mount point of the filesystem.  For example, if a filesystem
            is mounted at <i>/d2</i>, the <i>pathname</i> argument for the directory
            <i>/d2/users</i> is ``users''.  A <i>pathname</i> can be a file or a
            directory; if it is a directory, the entire hierarchy of
            files and subdirectories rooted at that directory is dumped.
            Subtree dumps cannot be used as the base for incremental
            dumps (see the <b>-l </b>option above).

       <b>-t </b><i>file</i>
            Sets the dump time to the modification time of <i>file</i> rather
            than using the current time.  <i>xfsdump</i> uses the dump time to
            determine what files need to be backed up during an
            incremental dump. This option should be used when dumping
            snapshots so that the dump time matches the time the
            snapshot was taken. Otherwise files modified after a
            snapshot is taken may be skipped in the next incremental
            dump.

       <b>-v </b><i>verbosity</i>
       <b>-v </b><i>subsys</i>=<i>verbosity</i>[,<i>subsys</i>=<i>verbosity</i>,...]
            Specifies the level of detail used for messages displayed
            during the course of the dump. The <i>verbosity</i> argument can be
            passed as either a string or an integer. If passed as a
            string the following values may be used: <b>silent</b>, <b>verbose</b>,
            <b>trace</b>, <b>debug</b>, or <b>nitty</b>.  If passed as an integer, values
            from 0-5 may be used. The values 0-4 correspond to the
            strings already listed. The value 5 can be used to produce
            even more verbose debug output.

            The first form of this option activates message logging
            across all dump subsystems. The second form allows the
            message logging level to be controlled on a per-subsystem
            basis. The two forms can be combined (see the example
            below). The argument <i>subsys</i> can take one of the following
            values: <b>general</b>, <b>proc</b>, <b>drive</b>, <b>media</b>, <b>inventory</b>, <b>inomap </b>and
            <b>excluded_files</b>.

            For example, to dump the root filesystem with tracing
            activated for all subsystems:

                 <b># xfsdump -v trace -f /dev/tape /</b>

            To enable debug-level tracing for drive and media
            operations:

                 <b># xfsdump -v drive=debug,media=debug -f /dev/tape /</b>

            To enable tracing for all subsystems, and debug level
            tracing for drive operations only:

                 <b># xfsdump -v trace,drive=debug -f /dev/tape /</b>

            To list files that will be excluded from the dump:

                 <b># xfsdump -e -v excluded_files=debug -f /dev/tape /</b>

       <b>-z </b><i>size</i>
            Specifies the maximum size, in kilobytes, of files to be
            included in the dump.  Files over this size, will be
            excluded from the dump, except for DMF dual-state files when
            '-a option' is specified (see '-a option' above).  When
            specified, '-a option' takes precedence over '-z option'.
            The size is an estimate based on the number of disk blocks
            actually used by the file, and so does not include holes.
            In other words, size refers to the amount of space the file
            would take in the resulting dump.  On an interactive
            restore, the skipped file is visible with xfsrestore's 'ls'
            and while you can use the 'add' and 'extract' commands,
            nothing will be restored.

       <b>-A   </b>Do not dump extended file attributes.  When dumping a
            filesystem managed within a DMF environment this option
            should not be used. DMF stores file migration status within
            extended attributes associated with each file. If these
            attributes are not preserved when the filesystem is
            restored, files that had been in migrated state will not be
            recallable by DMF. Note that dumps containing extended file
            attributes cannot be restored with older versions of
            <i>xfsrestore</i>(8).

       <b>-B </b><i>session_id</i>
            Specifies the ID of the dump session upon which this dump
            session is to be based.  If this option is specified, the <b>-l</b>
            (level) and <b>-R </b>(resume) options are not allowed.  Instead,
            <b>xfsdump </b>determines if the current dump session should be
            incremental and/or resumed, by looking at the base session's
            level and interrupted attributes.  If the base session was
            interrupted, the current dump session is a resumption of
            that base at the same level.  Otherwise, the current dump
            session is an incremental dump with a level one greater than
            that of the base session.  This option allows incremental
            and resumed dumps to be based on any previous dump, rather
            than just the most recent.

       <b>-D   </b>Controls which directories are backed up during an
            incremental dump. By default unchanged directories are
            dumped if files or directories beneath them have changed.
            This results in a self-contained dump -- if a base dump is
            lost, or you know the file(s) you wish to restore is in an
            incremental dump, you can restore just that dump without
            loading the base dump(s) first. However, this method
            requires a potentially expensive traversal through the
            filesystem.

            When <b>-D </b>is specified, unchanged directories are not dumped.
            This results in a faster dump, but files will end up in the
            <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/xfsrestore.8.html">xfsrestore(8)</a> <i>orphanage</i> directory unless the base dump(s) is
            loaded first.

       <b>-E   </b>Pre-erase media.  If this option is specified, media is
            erased prior to use.  The operator is prompted for
            confirmation, unless the <b>-F </b>option is also specified.

       <b>-F   </b>Don't prompt the operator.  When <i>xfsdump</i> encounters a media
            object containing non-xfsdump data, <i>xfsdump</i> normally asks
            the operator for permission to overwrite.  With this option
            the overwrite is performed, no questions asked.  When
            <i>xfsdump</i> encounters end-of-media during a dump, <i>xfsdump</i>
            normally asks the operator if another media object will be
            provided.  With this option the dump is instead interrupted.

       <b>-I   </b>Displays the <i>xfsdump</i> inventory (no dump is performed).
            <i>xfsdump</i> records each dump session in an online inventory in
            <i>/var/lib/xfsdump/inventory</i>.  <i>xfsdump</i> uses this inventory to
            determine the base for incremental dumps.  It is also useful
            for manually identifying a dump session to be restored.
            Suboptions to filter the inventory display are described
            later.

       <b>-J   </b>Inhibits the normal update of the inventory.  This is useful
            when the media being dumped to will be discarded or
            overwritten.

       <b>-K   </b>Generate a format 2 dump instead of the current format. This
            is useful if the dump will be restored on a system with an
            older <i>xfsrestore</i> which does not understand the current dump
            format. Use of this option is otherwise not recommended.

       <b>-L </b><i>session_label</i>
            Specifies a label for the dump session.  It can be any
            arbitrary string up to 255 characters long.

       <b>-M </b><i>label</i> [ <b>-M </b><i>label</i> ... ]
            Specifies a label for the first media object (for example,
            tape cartridge) written on the corresponding destination
            during the session.  It can be any arbitrary string up to
            255 characters long.  Multiple media object labels can be
            specified, one for each destination.

       <b>-O </b><i>options_file</i>
            Insert the options contained in <i>options_file</i> into the
            beginning of the command line.  The options are specified
            just as they would appear if typed into the command line.
            In addition, newline characters (\n) can be used as
            whitespace.  The options are placed before all options
            actually given on the command line, just after the command
            name.  Only one <b>-O </b>option can be used.  Recursive use is
            ignored.  The source filesystem cannot be specified in
            <i>options_file</i>.

       <b>-R   </b>Resumes a previously interrupted dump session.  If the most
            recent dump at this dump's level (<b>-l </b>option) was
            interrupted, this dump contains only files not in the
            interrupted dump and consistent with the incremental level.
            However, files contained in the interrupted dump that have
            been subsequently modified are re-dumped.

       <b>-T   </b>Inhibits interactive dialogue timeouts.  When the <b>-F </b>option
            is not specified, <i>xfsdump</i> prompts the operator for labels
            and media changes.  Each dialogue normally times out if no
            response is supplied.  This option prevents the timeout.

       <b>-Y </b><i>length</i>
            Specify I/O buffer ring length.  <i>xfsdump</i> uses a ring of
            output buffers to achieve maximum throughput when dumping to
            tape drives.  The default ring length is 3.  However, this
            is not currently enabled on Linux yet, making this option
            benign.

       <b>-    </b>A lone <b>- </b>causes the dump stream to be sent to the standard
            output, where it can be piped to another utility such as
            <i>xfsrestore</i>(8) or redirected to a file.  This option cannot
            be used with the <b>-f </b>option.  The <b>- </b>must follow all other
            options and precede the filesystem specification.

       The filesystem, <i>filesystem</i>, can be specified either as a mount
       point or as a special device file (for example,
       <i>/dev/dsk/dks0d1s0</i>).  The filesystem must be mounted to be dumped.
