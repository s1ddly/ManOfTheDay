       A strippable file is defined as a relocatable, object, or
       executable file.  On XSI-conformant systems, a strippable file
       can also be an archive of object or relocatable files.

       The <i>strip</i> utility shall remove from strippable files named by the
       <i>file</i> operands any information the implementor deems unnecessary
       for execution of those files. The nature of that information is
       unspecified. The effect of <i>strip</i> on object and executable files
       shall be similar to the use of the <b>-s </b>option to <i>c99</i> or <i>fort77</i>.
       The effect of <i>strip</i> on an archive of object files shall be
       similar to the use of the <b>-s </b>option to <i>c99</i> or <i>fort77</i> for each
       object file in the archive.
