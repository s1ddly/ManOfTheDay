<pre>
       The GNU implementation of the <i>man</i> macro package is part of the
       <i>groff</i> document formatting system.  It is used to produce manual
       pages (“man pages”) like the one you are reading.

       This document presents the macros thematically; for those needing
       only a quick reference, the following table lists them
       alphabetically, with cross-references to appropriate subsections
       below.

       Man page authors and maintainers who are not already experienced
       <i>groff</i> users should consult <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/groff_man_style.7.html">groff_man_style(7)</a>, an expanded
       version of this document, for additional explanations and advice.
       It covers only those concepts required for man page document
       maintenance, and not the full breadth of the <i>groff</i> typesetting
       system.

       Macros whose use we discourage (<b>.AT</b>, <b>.DT</b>, <b>.HP</b>, <b>.PD</b>, and <b>.UC</b>) are
       described in subsection “Deprecated features” below.

   <b>Macro reference preliminaries</b>
       Each macro is described in a tagged paragraph.  Closely related
       macros, such as <b>.EX </b>and <b>.EE</b>, are grouped together.

       An empty macro argument can be specified with a pair of double-
       quotes (“""”), but the <i>man</i> package is designed such that this
       should seldom be necessary.  Most macro arguments are strings
       that will be output as text; exceptions are noted.

   <b>Document structure macros</b>
       The highest level of organization of a man page is determined by
       this group of macros.  <b>.TH </b>(title heading) identifies the
       document as a man page and defines information enabling its
       indexing by <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/mandb.8.html">mandb(8)</a> or a similar tool.  Section headings (<b>.SH</b>),
       one of which is mandatory and many of which are standardized,
       facilitate quick location of relevant material by the reader and
       aid the man page writer to discuss all essential aspects of the
       topic.  Subsection headings (<b>.SS</b>) are optional and permit
       sections that grow long to develop in a controlled way.  Many
       technical discussions benefit from examples; lengthy ones,
       especially those reflecting multiple lines of input to or output
       from the system, are usefully bracketed by <b>.EX </b>and <b>.EE</b>.  When
       none of the foregoing meets a structural demand, a region within
       a (sub)section can be manually inset within <b>.RS </b>and <b>.RE </b>macros.

       <b>.TH </b><i>title section</i> [<i>footer-middle</i>] [<i>footer-inside</i>] [<i>header-middle</i>]
              Define the title of the man page as <i>title</i> and the section
              of the manual volume as <i>section</i>.  See <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/man.1.html">man(1)</a> for details
              on the section numbers and suffixes applicable to your
              system.  <i>title</i> and <i>section</i> are positioned together at the
              left and right in the header line (with <i>section</i> in
              parentheses immediately appended to <i>title</i>).  <i>footer-middle</i>
              is centered in the footer line.  The arrangement of the
              rest of the footer depends on whether double-sided layout
              is enabled with the option <b>-rD1</b>.  When disabled (the
              default), <i>footer-inside</i> is positioned at the bottom left.
              Otherwise, <i>footer-inside</i> appears at the bottom left on
              odd-numbered (recto) pages, and at the bottom right on
              even-numbered (verso) pages.  The outside footer is the
              page number, except in the continuous-rendering mode
              enabled by the option <b>-rcR=1</b>, in which case it is the
              <i>title</i> and <i>section</i>, as in the header.  <i>header-middle</i> is
              centered in the header line.  If <i>section</i> is a simple
              integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive), or is exactly “3p”,
              there is no need to specify <i>header-middle</i>; the macro
              package will supply text for it.  For HTML output, headers
              and footers are completely suppressed.

              Additionally, this macro starts a new page; the page
              number is reset to 1 (unless the <b>-rC1 </b>option is given).
              This feature is intended only for formatting multiple man
              pages.

              A man page should contain exactly one <b>.TH </b>call at or near
              the beginning of the file, prior to any other macro calls.

       <b>.SH </b>[<i>heading-text</i>]
              Set <i>heading-text</i> as a section heading.  The text following
              <b>.SH </b>up to the end of the line, or the text on the next
              input line if <b>.SH </b>is given no arguments, is set with no
              indentation, in bold (or the font specified by the string
              <b>HF</b>) and, on typesetter devices, slightly larger than the
              base point size.  If the heading font <b>\*[HF] </b>is bold, use
              of an italic style in <i>heading-text</i> is mapped to the bold-
              italic style if available in the font family.
              Additionally, the left margin and indentation affecting
              subsequent text are reset to their default values.  Text
              on input lines after <i>heading-text</i> is set as an ordinary
              paragraph (<b>.P</b>).

              The content of <i>heading-text</i> and ordering of sections has
              been standardized by common practice, as has much of the
              layout of material within sections.  For example, a
              section called “Name” or “NAME” must exist, must be the
              first section after the <b>.TH </b>call, and must contain only a
              line of the form
                     <i>topic</i>[<b>, </b><i>another-topic</i>]... \- <i>summary-description</i>
              for a man page to be properly indexed.  See
              <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/groff_man_style.7.html">groff_man_style(7)</a> for suggestions and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/man.7.html">man(7)</a> for the
              conventions prevailing on your system.

       <b>.SS </b>[<i>subheading-text</i>]
              Set <i>subheading-text</i> as a subsection heading indented
              between a section heading and an ordinary paragraph (<b>.P</b>).
              See subsection “Horizontal and vertical spacing” below for
              the indentation amount.  The text following <b>.SS </b>up to the
              end of the line, or the text on the next input line if <b>.SS</b>
              is given no arguments, is set in bold (or the font
              specified by the string <b>HF</b>).  If the heading font <b>\*[HF]</b>
              is bold, use of an italic style in <i>heading-text</i> is mapped
              to the bold-italic style if available in the font family.
              Additionally, the left margin and indentation affecting
              subsequent text are reset to their default values.  Text
              on input lines after <i>subheading-text</i> is set as an ordinary
              paragraph (<b>.P</b>).

       <b>.EX</b>
       <b>.EE    </b>Begin and end example.  After <b>.EX</b>, filling is disabled and
              a constant-width (monospaced) font is selected.  Calling
              <b>.EE </b>enables filling and restores the previous font.

              These macros are extensions, introduced in Version 9
              Research Unix, to the original <i>man</i> package.  Many systems
              running AT&amp;T, Heirloom Doctools, or Plan 9 <i>troff</i> support
              them.  To be certain your page will be portable to systems
              that do not, copy their definitions from the <i>an-ext.tmac</i>
              file of a <i>groff</i> installation.

       <b>.RS </b>[<i>indent</i>]
              Start a new relative inset level, moving the left margin
              right by <i>indent</i>, if specified, and by a default amount
              otherwise; see subsection “Horizontal and vertical
              spacing” below.  Calls to <b>.RS </b>can be nested; each call
              increments by 1 the inset level used by <b>.RE</b>.  The inset
              level prior to any <b>.RS </b>calls is 1.

       <b>.RE </b>[<i>level</i>]
              End a relative inset; move the left margin back to that
              corresponding to inset level <i>level</i>.  If no argument is
              given, move the left margin one level back.

   <b>Paragraph macros</b>
       An ordinary paragraph (<b>.P</b>) is set without a first-line
       indentation at the current left margin, which by default is
       indented from the leftmost position of the output device.  In man
       pages and other technical literature, definition lists are
       frequently encountered; these can be set as “tagged paragraphs”,
       which have one (<b>.TP</b>) or more (<b>.TQ</b>) leading tags followed by a
       paragraph that has an additional indentation.  The indented
       paragraph (<b>.IP</b>) macro is useful to continue the indented content
       of a narrative started with <b>.TP</b>, or to present an itemized or
       ordered list.  All paragraph macros break the output line at the
       current position.  If another paragraph macro has occurred since
       the previous <b>.SH </b>or <b>.SS</b>, they (except for <b>.TQ</b>) follow the break
       with a default amount of vertical space, which can be changed by
       the deprecated <b>.PD </b>macro; see subsection “Horizontal and vertical
       spacing” below.  They also reset the point size and font style to
       defaults (<b>.TQ </b>again excepted); see subsection “Font style macros”
       below.

       <b>.P</b>
       <b>.LP</b>
       <b>.PP    </b>Begin a new paragraph; these macros are synonymous.  The
              indentation is reset to the default value; the left
              margin, as affected by <b>.RS </b>and <b>.RE</b>, is not.

       <b>.TP </b>[<i>indent</i>]
              Set a paragraph with a leading tag, and the remainder of
              the paragraph indented.  The input line following this
              macro, known as the <i>tag</i>, is printed at the current left
              margin.  Subsequent text is indented by <i>indent</i>, if
              specified, and by a default amount otherwise; see
              subsection “Horizontal and vertical spacing” below.

              If the tag is not as wide as the indentation, the
              paragraph starts on the same line as the tag, at the
              applicable indentation, and continues on the following
              lines.  Otherwise, the descriptive part of the paragraph
              begins on the line following the tag.

       <b>.TQ    </b>Set an additional tag for a paragraph tagged with <b>.TP</b>.
              The pending output line is broken.  The tag on the input
              line following this macro and subsequent lines are handled
              as with <b>.TP</b>.

              This macro is a GNU extension not defined on systems
              running AT&amp;T, Plan 9, or Solaris <i>troff</i>; see <i>an-ext.tmac</i> in
              section “Files” below.

       <b>.IP </b>[<i>tag</i>] [<i>indent</i>]
              Set an indented paragraph with an optional tag.  The <i>tag</i>
              and <i>indent</i> arguments, if present, are handled as with <b>.TP</b>,
              with the exception that the <i>tag</i> argument to <b>.IP </b>cannot
              include a macro call.

   <b>Command synopsis macros</b>
       Command synopses are a staple of section 1 and 8 man pages.
       These macros aid you to construct one that has the classical Unix
       appearance.  A command synopsis is wrapped in <b>.SY</b>/<b>.YS </b>calls, with
       command-line options of some formats indicated by <b>.OP</b>.

       These macros are extensions (<b>.OP </b>from Documenter's Workbench
       <i>troff</i>, <b>.SY </b>and <b>.YS </b>from GNU) not defined on systems running AT&amp;T,
       Plan 9, or Solaris <i>troff</i>; see <i>an-ext.tmac</i> in section “Files”
       below.

       <b>.SY </b><i>command</i>
              Begin synopsis.  A new paragraph is begun at the left
              margin unless <b>.SY </b>has already been called without a
              corresponding <b>.YS</b>, in which case only a break is
              performed.  Hyphenation is turned off.  The <i>command</i>
              argument is set in bold.  The output line is filled as
              normal, but if a break is required, subsequent output
              lines are indented by the width of <i>command</i> plus a space.

       <b>.OP </b><i>option-name</i> [<i>option-argument</i>]
              Indicate an optional command parameter called <i>option-name</i>,
              which is set in bold.  If the option takes an argument,
              specify <i>option-argument</i> using a noun, abbreviation, or
              hyphenated noun phrase.  If present, <i>option-argument</i> is
              preceded by a space and set in italics.  Square brackets
              in roman surround both arguments.

       <b>.YS    </b>End synopsis.  Restore previous indentation and initial
              hyphenation mode.

   <b>Hyperlink and email macros</b>
       Email addresses are bracketed with <b>.MT</b>/<b>.ME </b>and URL hyperlinks
       with <b>.UR</b>/<b>.UE</b>.

       These macros are GNU extensions not defined on systems running
       AT&amp;T, Plan 9, or Solaris <i>troff</i>; see <i>an-ext.tmac</i> in section
       “Files” below.

       <b>.MT </b><i>address</i>
       <b>.ME </b>[<i>punctuation</i>]
              Identify <i>address</i> as an RFC 6068 <i>addr-spec</i> for a “mailto:”
              URI with the text between the two macro calls as the link
              text.  A <i>punctuation</i> argument to <b>.ME </b>is placed at the end
              of the link text without intervening space.  <i>address</i> may
              not be visible in the output text, particularly if the man
              page is being viewed as HTML.  On a device that is not a
              browser, <i>address</i> is set in angle brackets after the link
              text and before <i>punctuation</i>.

       <b>.UR </b><i>URL</i>
       <b>.UE </b>[<i>punctuation</i>]
              Identify <i>URL</i> as an RFC 3986 URI hyperlink with the text
              between the two macro calls as the link text.  A
              <i>punctuation</i> argument to <b>.UE </b>is placed at the end of the
              link text without intervening space.  <i>URL</i> may not be
              visible in the output text, particularly if the man page
              is being viewed as HTML.  On a device that is not a
              browser, <i>URL</i> is set in angle brackets after the link text
              and before <i>punctuation</i>.

   <b>Font style macros</b>
       The <i>man</i> macro package is limited in its font styling options,
       offering only <b>bold </b>(<b>.B</b>), <i>italic</i> (<b>.I</b>), and roman.  Italic text is
       usually set underscored instead on terminal devices.  The <b>.SM </b>and
       <b>.SB </b>macros set text in roman or bold, respectively, at a smaller
       point size; these differ visually from regular-sized roman or
       bold text only on typesetter devices.  It is often necessary to
       set text in different styles without intervening space.  The
       macros <b>.BI</b>, <b>.BR</b>, <b>.IB</b>, <b>.IR</b>, <b>.RB</b>, and <b>.RI</b>, where “B”, “I”, and “R”
       indicate bold, italic, and roman, respectively, set their odd-
       and even-numbered arguments in alternating styles, with no space
       separating them.

       The default point size and family for typesetter devices is
       10-point Times, except on the <b>X75-12 </b>and <b>X100-12 </b>devices where
       the point size is 12.  The default style is roman.

       <b>.B </b>[<i>text</i>]
              Set <i>text</i> in bold.  If the macro is given no arguments, the
              text of the next input line is set in bold.

       <b>.I </b>[<i>text</i>]
              Set <i>text</i> in italics.  If the macro is given no arguments,
              the text of the next input line is set in italics.

       <b>.SM </b>[<i>text</i>]
              Set <i>text</i> one point smaller than the default point size on
              typesetter devices.  If the macro is given no arguments,
              the text of the next input line is set smaller.

       <b>.SB </b>[<i>text</i>]
              Set <i>text</i> in bold and (on typesetter devices) one point
              smaller than the default point size.  If the macro is
              given no arguments, the text of the next input line is set
              smaller and in bold.

       Unlike the above font style macros, the font style alternation
       macros below accept only arguments on the same line as the macro
       call.  Italic corrections are applied as appropriate.  If space
       is required within one of the arguments, first consider whether
       the same result could be achieved with as much clarity by using
       the single-style macros on separate input lines.  When it cannot,
       double-quote an argument containing embedded space characters.
       Setting all three different styles within a word presents
       challenges; see subsection “Portability” in <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/groff_man_style.7.html">groff_man_style(7)</a>
       for approaches.

       <b>.BI </b><i>bold-text italic-text</i> ...
              Set each argument in bold and italics, alternately.

       <b>.BR </b><i>bold-text roman-text</i> ...
              Set each argument in bold and roman, alternately.

       <b>.IB </b><i>italic-text bold-text</i> ...
              Set each argument in italics and bold, alternately.

       <b>.IR </b><i>italic-text roman-text</i> ...
              Set each argument in italics and roman, alternately.

       <b>.RB </b><i>roman-text bold-text</i> ...
              Set each argument in roman and bold, alternately.

       <b>.RI </b><i>roman-text italic-text</i> ...
              Set each argument in roman and italics, alternately.

   <b>Horizontal and vertical spacing</b>
       The <i>indent</i> argument accepted by <b>.RS</b>, <b>.IP</b>, <b>.TP</b>, and the deprecated
       <b>.HP </b>is a number plus an optional scaling indicator.  If no
       scaling indicator is given, the <i>man</i> package assumes “n”.  An
       indentation specified in a call to <b>.IP</b>, <b>.TP</b>, or the deprecated
       <b>.HP </b>persists until (1) another of these macros is called with an
       explicit <i>indent</i> argument, or (2) <b>.SH</b>, <b>.SS</b>, or <b>.P </b>or its synonyms
       is called; these clear the indentation entirely.  Relative insets
       created by <b>.RS </b>move the left margin and persist until <b>.RS</b>, <b>.RE</b>,
       <b>.SH</b>, or <b>.SS </b>is called.

       The indentation amount exhibited by ordinary paragraphs set with
       <b>.P </b>(and its synonyms) not within an <b>.RS</b>/<b>.RE </b>relative inset, and
       the default used when <b>.IP</b>, <b>.RS</b>, <b>.TP</b>, and the deprecated <b>.HP </b>are
       not given an indentation argument, is 7.2n for typesetter devices
       and 7n for terminal devices (but see the <b>-rIN </b>option).  Headers,
       footers (both set with <b>.TH</b>), and section headings (<b>.SH</b>) are set
       with no indentation and subsection headings (<b>.SS</b>) are indented 3n
       (but see the <b>-rSN </b>option).  However, the HTML output device
       ignores indentation completely.

       The following macros break the output line and insert vertical
       space: <b>.SH</b>, <b>.SS</b>, <b>.TP</b>, <b>.P </b>(and its synonyms), <b>.IP</b>, and the
       deprecated <b>.HP</b>.  The default inter-section and inter-paragraph
       spacing is is 1v for terminal devices and 0.4v for typesetter
       devices.  In <b>.EX</b>/<b>.EE </b>sections, the inter-paragraph spacing is 1v
       regardless of output device.  (The deprecated macro <b>.PD </b>can
       change this vertical spacing, but its use is discouraged.)  The
       macros <b>.RS</b>, <b>.RE</b>, <b>.EX</b>, <b>.EE</b>, and <b>.TQ </b>also cause a break but no
       insertion of vertical space.

   <b>Registers</b>
       Registers are described in section “Options” below.  They can be
       set not only on the command line but in the site <i>man.local</i> file
       as well; see section “Files” below.

   <b>Strings</b>
       The following strings are defined for use in man pages.  None of
       these is necessary in a contemporary man page; see
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/groff_man_style.7.html">groff_man_style(7)</a>.  Others are supported for configuration of
       rendering parameters; see section “Options” below.

       <b>\*R    </b>interpolates a special character escape sequence for the
              “registered sign” glyph, <b>\(rg</b>, if available, and “(Reg.)”
              otherwise.

       <b>\*S    </b>interpolates an escape sequence setting the point size to
              the document default.

       <b>\*(lq</b>
       <b>\*(rq  </b>interpolate special character escape sequences for left
              and right double-quotation marks, <b>\(lq </b>and <b>\(rq</b>,
              respectively.

       <b>\*(Tm  </b>interpolate special character escape sequences for the
              “trade mark sign” glyph, <b>\(tm</b>, if available, and “(TM)”
              otherwise.

   <b>Interaction with preprocessors</b>
       When a preprocessor like <i>tbl</i> or <i>eqn</i> is needed, a hint can be
       given to the man page librarian by making the first line of a man
       page look like this:

              <b>'\" </b><i>word</i>

       The line starts with an apostrophe ('), not a dot, and a single
       space character follows the double quote.  The <i>word</i> consists of
       one letter for each needed preprocessor: “e” for <i>eqn</i>, “r” for
       <i>refer</i>, and “t” for <i>tbl</i>.  Modern implementations of the <i>man</i>
       program can use this information to automatically call the
       required preprocessor(s) in the right order.

       The usual <i>tbl</i> and <i>eqn</i> macros for table and equation inclusion,
       <b>.TS</b>, <b>.T&amp;</b>, <b>.TE</b>, <b>.EQ</b>, and <b>.EN</b>, may be used freely.  Terminal
       devices are extremely limited in presentation of mathematical
       equations.

   <b>Hooks</b>
       Two macros, both GNU extensions, are called internally by the
       <i>groff man</i> package to format page headers and footers and can be
       redefined by the administrator in a site's <i>man.local</i> file (see
       section “Files” below).  The default headers and footers are
       documented in the description of <b>.TH </b>above.  Because these macros
       are hooks for <i>groff man</i> internals, man pages have no reason to
       call them.  A macro definition for these hooks typically consists
       of a “.tl” request.

       <b>.BT    </b>Set the page footer text (“bottom trap”).

       <b>.PT    </b>Set the page header text (“page trap”).

   <b>Deprecated features</b>
       Use of the following in man pages for public distribution is
       discouraged.

       <b>.AT </b>[<i>system</i> [<i>release</i>]]
              Alter the footer for use with legacy AT&amp;T man pages,
              overriding any definition of the <i>footer-inside</i> argument to
              <b>.TH</b>.  This macro exists only for compatibility, to render
              man pages from historical systems.

              The first argument <i>system</i> can be:

                     3      7th edition <i>(default)</i>

                     4      System III

                     5      System V

              The optional second argument <i>release</i> specifies the release
              number, such as in “System V Release 3”.

       <b>.DT    </b>Set tab stops every 0.5i (inches).  Since this macro is
              called by <b>.TH</b>, it would make sense to call it only if a
              man page changes the tab stops.

              Use of this presentation-level macro is deprecated.  It
              translates poorly to HTML, under which exact space control
              and tabulation are not readily available.  Thus,
              information or distinctions that you use <b>.DT </b>to express
              are likely to be lost.  If you feel tempted to use it, you
              should probably be composing a table using <i>tbl</i>(1) markup
              instead.

       <b>.HP </b>[<i>indent</i>]
              Set up a paragraph with a hanging left indentation.  The
              <i>indent</i> argument, if present, is handled as with <b>.TP</b>.

              Use of this presentation-level macro is deprecated.  A
              hanging indentation cannot be expressed naturally under
              HTML, and HTML-based man page processors may interpret it
              as starting an ordinary paragraph.  Thus, any information
              or distinction you mean to express with the indentation
              may be lost.

       <b>.PD </b>[<i>vertical-space</i>]
              Define the vertical space between paragraphs or
              (sub)sections.  The optional argument <i>vertical-space</i>
              specifies the amount; the default scaling indicator is
              “v”.  Without an argument, the spacing is reset to its
              default value; see subsection “Horizontal and vertical
              spacing” above.

              Use of this presentation-level macro is deprecated.  It
              translates poorly to HTML, under which exact control of
              inter-paragraph spacing is not readily available.  Thus,
              information or distinctions that you use <b>.PD </b>to express
              are likely to be lost.

       <b>.UC </b>[<i>version</i>]
              Alter the footer for use with legacy BSD man pages,
              overriding any definition of the <i>footer-inside</i> argument to
              <b>.TH</b>.  This macro exists only for compatibility, to render
              man pages from historical systems.

              The argument <i>version</i> can be:

                     3      3rd Berkeley Distribution <i>(default)</i>

                     4      4th Berkeley Distribution

                     5      4.2 Berkeley Distribution

                     6      4.3 Berkeley Distribution

                     7      4.4 Berkeley Distribution

   <b>History</b>
       Version 7 Unix (1979) introduced the <i>man</i> macro package and
       supported all of the macros described in this page not listed as
       extensions, except <b>.P</b>, <b>.SB</b>, and the deprecated <b>.AT </b>and <b>.UC</b>.  The
       only strings defined were <b>R </b>and <b>S</b>; no registers were documented.
       <b>.UC </b>appeared in 3BSD (1980) and <b>.P </b>in Unix System III (1980).
       PWB/UNIX 2.0 (1980) added the <b>Tm </b>string.  4BSD (1980) added <b>lq</b>
       and <b>rq </b>strings.  4.3BSD (1986) added <b>.AT </b>and <b>.P</b>.  Version 9 Unix
       (1986) introduced <b>.EX </b>and <b>.EE</b>.  SunOS 4.0 (1988) may have been
       the first to support <b>.SB</b>.
