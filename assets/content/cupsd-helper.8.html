       The <b>cupsd-helper </b>programs perform long-running operations on
       behalf of the scheduler, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/cupsd.8.html">cupsd(8)</a>.  The <b>cups-deviced </b>helper
       program runs each CUPS <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/backend.7.html">backend(7)</a> with no arguments in order to
       discover the available printers.

       The <b>cups-driverd </b>helper program lists all available printer
       drivers, a subset of "matching" printer drivers, or a copy of a
       specific driver PPD file.

       The <b>cups-exec </b>helper program runs backends, filters, and other
       programs. On macOS these programs are run in a secure sandbox.
