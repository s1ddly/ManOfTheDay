       The <b>ovs-kmod-ctl </b>program is responsible for inserting and
       removing Open vSwitch kernel modules.  It is not meant to be
       invoked directly by system administrators but to be called
       internally by system startup scripts.  The script is used as part
       of an SELinux transition domain.

       Each of <b>ovs-kmod-ctl</b>'s commands is described separately below.
