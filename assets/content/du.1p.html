       By default, the <i>du</i> utility shall write to standard output the
       size of the file space allocated to, and the size of the file
       space allocated to each subdirectory of, the file hierarchy
       rooted in each of the specified files. By default, when a
       symbolic link is encountered on the command line or in the file
       hierarchy, <i>du</i> shall count the size of the symbolic link (rather
       than the file referenced by the link), and shall not follow the
       link to another portion of the file hierarchy. The size of the
       file space allocated to a file of type directory shall be defined
       as the sum total of space allocated to all files in the file
       hierarchy rooted in the directory plus the space allocated to the
       directory itself.

       When <i>du</i> cannot <i>stat</i>() files or <i>stat</i>() or read directories, it
       shall report an error condition and the final exit status is
       affected. A file that occurs multiple times under one file
       operand and that has a link count greater than 1 shall be counted
       and written for only one entry. It is implementation-defined
       whether a file that has a link count no greater than 1 is counted
       and written just once, or is counted and written for each
       occurrence. It is implementation-defined whether a file that
       occurs under one file operand is counted for other file operands.
       The directory entry that is selected in the report is
       unspecified. By default, file sizes shall be written in 512-byte
       units, rounded up to the next 512-byte unit.
