       <b>newhelp </b>generates the Performance Co-Pilot help text files used
       by Performance Metric Domain Agents (PMDAs).

       Normally <b>newhelp </b>operates on the default Performance Metrics Name
       Space (PMNS), however if the <b>-n </b>option is specified an
       alternative namespace is loaded from the file <i>pmnsfile</i>.

       When there is only one input file, the base name of the new
       database is derived from the name of the input <i>file</i>, otherwise
       the <b>-o </b>flag must be given to explicitly name the database.  If no
       input files are supplied, <b>newhelp </b>reads from the standard input
       stream, in which case the <b>-o </b>flag must be given.

       If the output file name is determined to be <b>foo</b>, <b>newhelp </b>will
       create <b>foo.dir </b>and <b>foo.pag</b>.

       The <b>-V </b>flag causes verbose messages to be printed while <b>newhelp</b>
       is parsing its input.

       The first line of each entry in a help source file consists of an
       ``@'' character beginning the line followed by a space and then
       the performance metric name and a one line description of the
       metric.  Following lines (up to the next line beginning with
       ``@'' or end of file) may contain a verbose help description.
       E.g.

            #
            # This is an example of newhelp's input syntax
            #
            @ kernel.all.cpu.idle CPU idle time
            A cumulative count of the number of milliseconds
            of CPU idle time, summed over all processors.

       Three-part numeric metric identifiers (PMIDs) may be used in
       place of metric names, e.g. 60.0.23 rather than
       kernel.all.cpu.idle in the example above.  Other than for dynamic
       metrics (where the existence of a metric is known to a PMDA, but
       not visible in the PMNS and hence has no name that could be known
       to <i>newhelp</i>) use of this syntactic variant is not encouraged.

       Lines beginning with ``#'' are ignored, as are blank lines in the
       file before the first ``@''.  The verbose help text is optional.

       As a special case, a ``metric'' name of the form <i>NNN.MM</i> (for
       numeric <i>NNN</i> and <i>MM</i>) is interpreted as an instance domain
       identification, and the text describes the instance domain.
