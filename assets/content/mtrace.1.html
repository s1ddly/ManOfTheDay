       <b>mtrace </b>is a Perl script used to interpret and provide human
       readable output of the trace log contained in the file
       <i>mtracedata</i>, whose contents were produced by <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/mtrace.3.html">mtrace(3)</a>.  If <i>binary</i>
       is provided, the output of <b>mtrace </b>also contains the source file
       name with line number information for problem locations (assuming
       that <i>binary</i> was compiled with debugging information).
