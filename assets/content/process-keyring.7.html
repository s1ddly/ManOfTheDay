       The process keyring is a keyring used to anchor keys on behalf of
       a process.  It is created only when a process requests it.  The
       process keyring has the name (description) <i>_pid</i>.

       A special serial number value, <b>KEY_SPEC_PROCESS_KEYRING</b>, is
       defined that can be used in lieu of the actual serial number of
       the calling process's process keyring.

       From the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/keyctl.1.html">keyctl(1)</a> utility, '<b>@p</b>' can be used instead of a numeric
       key ID in much the same way, but since <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/keyctl.1.html">keyctl(1)</a> is a program run
       after forking, this is of no utility.

       A thread created using the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/clone.2.html">clone(2)</a> <b>CLONE_THREAD </b>flag has the
       same process keyring as the caller of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/clone.2.html">clone(2)</a>.  When a new
       process is created using <b>fork</b>() it initially has no process
       keyring.  A process's process keyring is cleared on <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>.
       The process keyring is destroyed when the last thread that refers
       to it terminates.

       If a process doesn't have a process keyring when it is accessed,
       then the process keyring will be created if the keyring is to be
       modified; otherwise, the error <b>ENOKEY </b>results.
