       The <b>btrfs </b>utility is a toolbox for managing btrfs filesystems.
       There are command groups to work with subvolumes, devices, for
       whole filesystem or other specific actions. See section <b>COMMANDS</b>.

       There are also standalone tools for some tasks like <b>btrfs-convert</b>
       or <b>btrfstune </b>that were separate historically and/or havenâ€™t been
       merged to the main utility. See section <i>STANDALONE TOOLS</i> for more
       details.

       For other topics (mount options, etc) please refer to the
       separate manual page <b>btrfs</b>(5).
