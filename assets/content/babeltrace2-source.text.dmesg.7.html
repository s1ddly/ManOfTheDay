<pre>
       A Babeltrace 2 <b>source.text.dmesg </b>message iterator reads the lines
       of a Linux kernel ring buffer, as printed by the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dmesg.1.html">dmesg(1)</a> tool,
       and emits corresponding event messages.

           Linux kernel ring buffer
           lines (file or standard input)
             |
             |   +----------------+
             |   | src.text.dmesg |
             '--&gt;|                |
                 |            out @--&gt; Messages (single stream)
                 +----------------+

       See <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/babeltrace2-intro.7.html">babeltrace2-intro(7)</a> to learn more about the Babeltrace 2
       project and its core concepts.

       A <b>source.text.dmesg </b>message iterator names the events it creates
       <b>string</b>. Each event contain a single payload string field named
       <b>str </b>which contains the corresponding ring buffer line.

       By default, a <b>source.text.dmesg </b>message iterator reads the lines
       of the standard input stream. You can make the message iterator
       read the lines of a text file instead with the <b>path </b>parameter.

       By default, the message iterator tries to extract the timestamps
       of the kernel ring buffer lines and use them as the created
       events’s timestamps. A typical <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dmesg.1.html">dmesg(1)</a> line looks like this:

           [87166.510937] PM: Finishing wakeup.

       The <b>[87166.510937] </b>part is the timestamp to extract. When this
       information is available, the component creates a clock class
       which does NOT have the Unix epoch as its origin.

       You can make the message iterator not extract timestamps from
       lines with the <b>no-extract-timestamp </b>parameter.

           <b>Note</b>
           It is possible that the output of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dmesg.1.html">dmesg(1)</a> contains unsorted
           lines, that is, their timestamps go back in time. You can see
           this with the <b>--show-delta </b>option of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dmesg.1.html">dmesg(1)</a>: some time
           differences can be negative.

           This is due to a 2019 change (see
           &lt;<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pagestps://lwn.net/Articles/780556/">https://lwn.net/Articles/780556/</a>&gt;) to the kernel’s ring
           buffer API.

           As of this version, a <b>source.text.dmesg </b>message iterator
           requires that the input kernel ring buffer lines be sorted by
           timestamp (when they have timestamps), failing otherwise.
