<pre>
       A Tcl/Tk based graphical interface to review modified files,
       stage them into the index, enter a commit message and record the
       new commit onto the current branch. This interface is an
       alternative to the less interactive <i>git commit</i> program.

       <i>git citool</i> is actually a standard alias for <b>git gui citool</b>. See
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/git-gui.1.html">git-gui(1)</a> for more details.
