       Git users can broadly be grouped into four categories for the
       purposes of describing here a small set of useful command for
       everyday Git.

       •   Individual Developer (Standalone) commands are essential for
           anybody who makes a commit, even for somebody who works
           alone.

       •   If you work with other people, you will need commands listed
           in the Individual Developer (Participant) section as well.

       •   People who play the Integrator role need to learn some more
           commands in addition to the above.

       •   Repository Administration commands are for system
           administrators who are responsible for the care and feeding
           of Git repositories.
