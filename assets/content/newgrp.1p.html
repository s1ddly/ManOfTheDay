<pre>
       The <i>newgrp</i> utility shall create a new shell execution environment
       with a new real and effective group identification. Of the
       attributes listed in <i>Section 2.12</i>, <i>Shell Execution Environment</i>,
       the new shell execution environment shall retain the working
       directory, file creation mask, and exported variables from the
       previous environment (that is, open files, traps, unexported
       variables, alias definitions, shell functions, and <i>set</i> options
       may be lost). All other aspects of the process environment that
       are preserved by the <i>exec</i> family of functions defined in the
       System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017 shall also be preserved
       by <i>newgrp</i>; whether other aspects are preserved is unspecified.

       A failure to assign the new group identifications (for example,
       for security or password-related reasons) shall not prevent the
       new shell execution environment from being created.

       The <i>newgrp</i> utility shall affect the supplemental groups for the
       process as follows:

        *  On systems where the effective group ID is normally in the
           supplementary group list (or whenever the old effective group
           ID actually is in the supplementary group list):

           --  If the new effective group ID is also in the
               supplementary group list, <i>newgrp</i> shall change the
               effective group ID.

           --  If the new effective group ID is not in the supplementary
               group list, <i>newgrp</i> shall add the new effective group ID
               to the list, if there is room to add it.

        *  On systems where the effective group ID is not normally in
           the supplementary group list (or whenever the old effective
           group ID is not in the supplementary group list):

           --  If the new effective group ID is in the supplementary
               group list, <i>newgrp</i> shall delete it.

           --  If the old effective group ID is not in the supplementary
               list, <i>newgrp</i> shall add it if there is room.

       <b>Note:</b>
           The System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017 does not specify
           whether the effective group ID of a process is included in
           its supplementary group list.

       With no operands, <i>newgrp</i> shall change the effective group back to
       the groups identified in the user's user entry, and shall set the
       list of supplementary groups to that set in the user's group
       database entries.

       If the first argument is <b>'-'</b>, the results are unspecified.

       If a password is required for the specified group, and the user
       is not listed as a member of that group in the group database,
       the user shall be prompted to enter the correct password for that
       group. If the user is listed as a member of that group, no
       password shall be requested.  If no password is required for the
       specified group, it is implementation-defined whether users not
       listed as members of that group can change to that group. Whether
       or not a password is required, implementation-defined system
       accounting or security mechanisms may impose additional
       authorization restrictions that may cause <i>newgrp</i> to write a
       diagnostic message and suppress the changing of the group
       identification.
