       ldapexop issues the LDAP extended operation specified by <b>oid </b>or
       one of the special keywords <b>whoami</b>, <b>cancel</b>, or <b>refresh</b>.

       Additional data for the extended operation can be passed to the
       server using <i>data</i> or base-64 encoded as <i>b64data</i> in the case of
       <b>oid</b>, or using the additional parameters in the case of the
       specially named extended operations above.

       Please note that ldapexop behaves differently for the same
       extended operation when it was given as an OID or as a specially
       named operation:

       Calling ldapexop with the OID of the <b>whoami </b>(RFC 4532) extended
       operation

         ldapexop [&lt;options&gt;] 1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.1.11.3

       yields

         # extended operation response
         data:: &lt;base64 encoded response data&gt;

       while calling it with the keyword <b>whoami</b>

         ldapexop [&lt;options&gt;] whoami

       results in

         dn:&lt;client's identity&gt;
