       The GNU <b>objcopy </b>utility copies the contents of an object file to
       another.  <b>objcopy </b>uses the GNU BFD Library to read and write the
       object files.  It can write the destination object file in a
       format different from that of the source object file.  The exact
       behavior of <b>objcopy </b>is controlled by command-line options.  Note
       that <b>objcopy </b>should be able to copy a fully linked file between
       any two formats. However, copying a relocatable object file
       between any two formats may not work as expected.

       <b>objcopy </b>creates temporary files to do its translations and
       deletes them afterward.  <b>objcopy </b>uses BFD to do all its
       translation work; it has access to all the formats described in
       BFD and thus is able to recognize most formats without being told
       explicitly.

       <b>objcopy </b>can be used to generate S-records by using an output
       target of <b>srec </b>(e.g., use <b>-O srec</b>).

       <b>objcopy </b>can be used to generate a raw binary file by using an
       output target of <b>binary </b>(e.g., use <b>-O binary</b>).  When <b>objcopy</b>
       generates a raw binary file, it will essentially produce a memory
       dump of the contents of the input object file.  All symbols and
       relocation information will be discarded.  The memory dump will
       start at the load address of the lowest section copied into the
       output file.

       When generating an S-record or a raw binary file, it may be
       helpful to use <b>-S </b>to remove sections containing debugging
       information.  In some cases <b>-R </b>will be useful to remove sections
       which contain information that is not needed by the binary file.

       Note---<b>objcopy </b>is not able to change the endianness of its input
       files.  If the input format has an endianness (some formats do
       not), <b>objcopy </b>can only copy the inputs into file formats that
       have the same endianness or which have no endianness (e.g.,
       <b>srec</b>).  (However, see the <b>--reverse-bytes </b>option.)
