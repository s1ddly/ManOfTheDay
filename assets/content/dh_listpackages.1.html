       <b>dh_listpackages </b>is a debhelper program that outputs a list of all
       binary packages debhelper commands will act on. If you pass it
       some options, it will change the list to match the packages other
       debhelper commands would act on if passed the same options.

       Packages are listed in the order they appear in <i>debian/control</i>.
