   <b>Metadata updates:</b>
       To service metadata update requests a daemon, <i>mdmon</i>, is
       introduced.  <i>Mdmon</i> is tasked with polling the sysfs namespace
       looking for changes in <b>array_state</b>, <b>sync_action</b>, and per disk
       <b>state </b>attributes.  When a change is detected it calls a per
       metadata type handler to make modifications to the metadata.  The
       following actions are taken:

              <b>array_state - inactive</b>
                     Clear the dirty bit for the volume and let the
                     array be stopped

              <b>array_state - write pending</b>
                     Set the dirty bit for the array and then set
                     <b>array_state </b>to <b>active</b>.  Writes are blocked until
                     userspace writes <b>active.</b>

              <b>array_state - active-idle</b>
                     The safe mode timer has expired so set array state
                     to clean to block writes to the array

              <b>array_state - clean</b>
                     Clear the dirty bit for the volume

              <b>array_state - read-only</b>
                     This is the initial state that all arrays start at.
                     <i>mdmon</i> takes one of the three actions:

                     1/     Transition the array to read-auto keeping
                            the dirty bit clear if the metadata handler
                            determines that the array does not need
                            resyncing or other modification

                     2/     Transition the array to active if the
                            metadata handler determines a resync or some
                            other manipulation is necessary

                     3/     Leave the array read-only if the volume is
                            marked to not be monitored; for example, the
                            metadata version has been set to
                            "external:-dev/md127" instead of
                            "external:/dev/md127"

              <b>sync_action - resync-to-idle</b>
                     Notify the metadata handler that a resync may have
                     completed.  If a resync process is idled before it
                     completes this event allows the metadata handler to
                     checkpoint resync.

              <b>sync_action - recover-to-idle</b>
                     A spare may have completed rebuilding so tell the
                     metadata handler about the state of each disk.
                     This is the metadata handler's opportunity to clear
                     any "out-of-sync" bits and clear the volume's
                     degraded status.  If a recovery process is idled
                     before it completes this event allows the metadata
                     handler to checkpoint recovery.

              <b>&lt;disk&gt;/state - faulty</b>
                     A disk failure kicks off a series of events.
                     First, notify the metadata handler that a disk has
                     failed, and then notify the kernel that it can
                     unblock writes that were dependent on this disk.
                     After unblocking the kernel this disk is set to be
                     removed+ from the member array.  Finally the disk
                     is marked failed in all other member arrays in the
                     container.

                     + Note This behavior differs slightly from native
                     MD arrays where removal is reserved for a <b>mdadm</b>
                     <b>--remove </b>event.  In the external metadata case the
                     container holds the final reference on a block
                     device and a <b>mdadm --remove &lt;container&gt; &lt;victim&gt;</b>
                     call is still required.

   <b>Containers:</b>
       External metadata formats, like DDF, differ from the native MD
       metadata formats in that they define a set of disks and a series
       of sub-arrays within those disks.  MD metadata in comparison
       defines a 1:1 relationship between a set of block devices and a
       RAID array.  For example to create 2 arrays at different RAID
       levels on a single set of disks, MD metadata requires the disks
       be partitioned and then each array can be created with a subset
       of those partitions.  The supported external formats perform this
       disk carving internally.

       Container devices simply hold references to all member disks and
       allow tools like <i>mdmon</i> to determine which active arrays belong to
       which container.  Some array management commands like disk
       removal and disk add are now only valid at the container level.
       Attempts to perform these actions on member arrays are blocked
       with error messages like:

              "mdadm: Cannot remove disks from a ´member´ array, perform
              this operation on the parent container"

       Containers are identified in /proc/mdstat with a metadata version
       string "external:&lt;metadata name&gt;". Member devices are identified
       by "external:/&lt;container device&gt;/&lt;member index&gt;", or
       "external:-&lt;container device&gt;/&lt;member index&gt;" if the array is to
       remain readonly.
