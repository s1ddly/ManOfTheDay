       <b>fdisk </b>is a dialog-driven program for creation and manipulation of
       partition tables. It understands GPT, MBR, Sun, SGI and BSD
       partition tables.

       Block devices can be divided into one or more logical disks
       called <i>partitions</i>. This division is recorded in the <i>partition</i>
       <i>table</i>, usually found in sector 0 of the disk. (In the BSD world
       one talks about `disk slices' and a `disklabel'.)

       All partitioning is driven by device I/O limits (the topology) by
       default. <b>fdisk </b>is able to optimize the disk layout for a
       4K-sector size and use an alignment offset on modern devices for
       MBR and GPT. It is always a good idea to follow <b>fdisk</b>â€™s defaults
       as the default values (e.g., first and last partition sectors)
       and partition sizes specified by the +/-&lt;size&gt;{M,G,...} notation
       are always aligned according to the device properties.

       CHS (Cylinder-Head-Sector) addressing is deprecated and not used
       by default. Please, do not follow old articles and
       recommendations with <b>fdisk -S &lt;n&gt; -H &lt;n&gt; </b>advices for SSD or
       4K-sector devices.

       Note that <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/partx.8.html">partx(8)</a> provides a rich interface for scripts to print
       disk layouts, <b>fdisk </b>is mostly designed for humans. Backward
       compatibility in the output of <b>fdisk </b>is not guaranteed. The input
       (the commands) should always be backward compatible.
