       <b>usb-devices </b>is a shell script that can be used to display details
       of USB buses in the system and the devices connected to them.

       The output of the script is similar to the <i>usb/devices</i> file
       available either under <i>/proc/bus</i> (if usbfs is mounted), or under
       <i>/sys/kernel/debug</i> (if debugfs is mounted there). The script is
       primarily intended to be used if the file is not available.

       In contrast to the <i>usb/devices</i> file, this script only lists
       <i>active</i> interfaces (those marked with a "*" in the <i>usb/devices</i>
       file) and their endpoints.

       Be advised that there can be differences in the way information
       is sorted, as well as in the format of the output.
