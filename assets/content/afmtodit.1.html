       <i>afmtodit</i> converts an Adobe Font Metric file, <i>afm-file</i>, for use
       with the <b>ps </b>and <b>pdf </b>output drivers of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/groff.1.html">groff(1)</a>.  <i>map-file</i>
       associates a <i>groff</i> character name with a PostScript character
       name.  Output is written to <i>font</i>, a file named for the intended
       <i>groff</i> font name (but see the <b>-o </b>option).

       <i>afm-file</i> should contain a sequence of lines of the form
              <i>ps-char groff-char</i>
       where <i>ps-char</i> is the PostScript name of the character and <i>groff-</i>
       <i>char</i> is the <i>groff</i> name of the character (as used in the <i>groff</i>
       font file).  The same <i>ps-char</i> can occur multiple times in the
       file; each <i>groff-char</i> must occur at most once.  Lines starting
       with “#” and blank lines are ignored.  If the file isn't found in
       the current directory, it is sought in the <i>devps/generate</i>
       subdirectory of the default font directory.

       If a PostScript character is not mentioned in <i>map-file</i>, and a
       generic <i>groff</i> glyph name can't be deduced using the Adobe Glyph
       List (AGL, built into <i>afmtodit</i>), then <i>afmtodit</i> puts the
       PostScript character into the <i>groff</i> font file as an unnamed
       character which can only be accessed by the “\N” escape sequence
       in a <i>roff</i> document.  In particular, this is true for glyph
       variants named in the form “<i>foo</i>.<i>bar</i>“; all glyph names containing
       one or more periods are mapped to unnamed entities.  Unless <b>-e </b>is
       specified, the encoding defined in the AFM file (i.e., entries
       with non-negative character codes) is used.  Refer to section
       “Using Symbols” in <i>Groff: The GNU Implementation of troff</i>, the
       <i>groff</i> Texinfo manual, which describes how <i>groff</i> glyph names are
       constructed.

       Characters not encoded in the AFM file (i.e., entries which have
       “-1” as the character code) are still available in <i>groff</i>; they
       get glyph index values greater than 255 (or greater than the
       biggest character code used in the AFM file in the unlikely case
       that it is greater than 255) in the <i>groff</i> font file.  Glyph
       indices of unencoded characters don't have a specific order; it
       is best to access them with glyph names only.

       If there is a downloadable font file for the font, it may be
       listed in the file <i>/usr/local/share/groff/1.23.0/font/devps/</i>
       <i>download</i>; see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/grops.1.html">grops(1)</a>.

       If the <b>-i </b>option is used, <i>afmtodit</i> automatically generates an
       italic correction, a left italic correction, and a subscript
       correction for each character (the significance of these is
       explained in <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/groff_font.5.html">groff_font(5)</a>); they can be specified for individual
       characters by adding to the <i>afm-file</i> lines of the form:
              italicCorrection <i>ps-char n</i>
              leftItalicCorrection <i>ps-char n</i>
              subscriptCorrection <i>ps-char n</i>
       where <i>ps-char</i> is the PostScript name of the character, and <i>n</i> is
       the desired value of the corresponding parameter in thousandths
       of an em.  Such parameters are normally needed only for italic
       (or oblique) fonts.
