       The GNU <i>roff</i> TTY (“Teletype”) output driver translates the output
       of <i>troff</i>(1) into a form suitable for typewriter-like devices,
       including terminal emulators.  Normally, <i>grotty</i> is invoked by
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/groff.1.html">groff(1)</a> when the latter is given one of the <b>-Tascii</b>, <b>-Tlatin1</b>,
       or <b>-Tutf8 </b>options on systems using ISO character encoding
       standards, or with <b>-Tcp1047 </b>or <b>-Tutf8 </b>on EBCDIC-based hosts.  If
       no <i>file</i> arguments are given, or if <i>file</i> is “-”, <i>grotty</i> reads the
       standard input stream.  Output is written to the standard output
       stream.

       By default, <i>grotty</i> emits SGR escape sequences (from ISO 6429,
       popularly called “ANSI escapes”) to change text attributes (bold,
       italic, underline, reverse-video, and colors).  Devices
       supporting the appropriate sequences can view <i>roff</i> documents
       using eight different background and foreground colors.

       In keeping with long-standing practice and the rarity of
       terminals, hardware or emulated, that support oblique or italic
       fonts, italicized text is represented with underlining by
       default—but see the <b>-i </b>option below.

       Following ISO 6429, the following colors are defined in <i>tty.tmac</i>:
       black, white, red, green, blue, yellow, magenta, and cyan.
       Unrecognized colors are mapped to the default color, which is
       dependent on the settings of the terminal.

   <b>SGR support in pagers</b>
       When paging <i>grotty</i>'s output with <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/less.1.html">less(1)</a>, the latter program must
       be instructed to pass SGR sequences through to the device; its <b>-R</b>
       option is one way to achieve this.  Consequently, programs like
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/man.1.html">man(1)</a> which page <i>roff</i> documents with <i>less</i> must call it with an
       appopriate option.

   <b>Legacy output format</b>
       The <b>-c </b>option tells <i>grotty</i> to use an output format compatible
       with paper terminals, like the Teletype machines for which <i>roff</i>
       and <i>nroff</i> were first developed but which are no longer in wide
       use.  SGR escape sequences are not emitted.  Instead, <i>grotty</i>
       overstrikes, representing a bold character <i>c</i> with the sequence
       “<i>c</i> BACKSPACE <i>c</i>” an italic character <i>c</i> with the sequence
       “<b>_ </b>BACKSPACE <i>c</i>”, and bold italics with “<b>_ </b>BACKSPACE <i>c</i>
       BACKSPACE <i>c</i>”.  Furthermore, color output is disabled.  The same
       effect can be achieved either by setting the <i>GROFF_NO_SGR</i>
       environment variable or by using a <i>groff</i> escape sequence within
       the document; see subsection “Device control commands”, below.

       The legacy output format can be rendered on a video terminal (or
       emulator) by piping <i>grotty</i>'s output through <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ul.1.html">ul(1)</a>, which may
       render bold italics as reverse video.  Some implementations of
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/more.1.html">more(1)</a> are also able to display these sequences; you may wish to
       experiment with that command's <b>-b </b>option.  <i>less</i> renders legacy
       bold and italics without requiring options.  In contrast to the
       terminal output drivers of some other <i>roff</i> implementations,
       <i>grotty</i> never outputs reverse line feeds.  There is therefore no
       need to filter its output through <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/col.1.html">col(1)</a>.

   <b>Device control commands</b>
       <i>grotty</i> understands a single device control function produced
       using the <i>roff</i> <b>\X </b>escape sequence in a document.

       <b>\X'tty: sgr </b>[<i>n</i>]<b>'</b>
              If <i>n</i> is non-zero or missing, enable SGR sequences (this is
              the default); otherwise, use the legacy output format.

   <b>Device description files</b>
       If <i>DESC</i> file for the character encoding contains the keyword
       “<b>unicode</b>”, <i>grotty</i> emits Unicode characters in UTF-8 encoding.
       Otherwise, it emits characters in a single-byte encoding
       depending on the data in the font description files.  See
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/groff_font.5.html">groff_font(5)</a> for more details.

       A font description file may contain a command “<b>internalname </b><i>n</i>”
       where <i>n</i> is a decimal integer.  If the 01 bit in <i>n</i> is set, then
       the font is treated as an italic font; if the 02 bit is set, then
       it is treated as a bold font.
