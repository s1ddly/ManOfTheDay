       <b>xfs_io </b>is a debugging tool like <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/xfs_db.8.html">xfs_db(8)</a>, but is aimed at
       examining the regular file I/O paths rather than the raw XFS
       volume itself.  These code paths include not only the obvious
       read/write/mmap interfaces for manipulating files, but also cover
       all of the XFS extensions (such as space preallocation,
       additional inode flags, etc).
