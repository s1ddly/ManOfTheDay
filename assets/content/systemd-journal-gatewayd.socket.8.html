       <b>systemd-journal-gatewayd </b>serves journal events over the network.
       Clients must connect using HTTP. The server listens on port 19531
       by default. If <b>--cert= </b>is specified, the server expects HTTPS
       connections.

       The program is started by <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/systemd.1.html">systemd(1)</a> and expects to receive a
       single socket. Use <b>systemctl start</b>
       <b>systemd-journal-gatewayd.socket </b>to start the service, and
       <b>systemctl enable systemd-journal-gatewayd.socket </b>to have it
       started on boot.
