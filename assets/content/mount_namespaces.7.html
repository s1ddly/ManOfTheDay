       For an overview of namespaces, see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/namespaces.7.html">namespaces(7)</a>.

       Mount namespaces provide isolation of the list of mounts seen by
       the processes in each namespace instance.  Thus, the processes in
       each of the mount namespace instances will see distinct single-
       directory hierarchies.

       The views provided by the <i>/proc/[pid]/mounts</i>,
       <i>/proc/[pid]/mountinfo</i>, and <i>/proc/[pid]/mountstats</i> files (all
       described in <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/proc.5.html">proc(5)</a>) correspond to the mount namespace in which
       the process with the PID <i>[pid]</i> resides.  (All of the processes
       that reside in the same mount namespace will see the same view in
       these files.)

       A new mount namespace is created using either <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/clone.2.html">clone(2)</a> or
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/unshare.2.html">unshare(2)</a> with the <b>CLONE_NEWNS </b>flag.  When a new mount namespace
       is created, its mount list is initialized as follows:

       *  If the namespace is created using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/clone.2.html">clone(2)</a>, the mount list of
          the child's namespace is a copy of the mount list in the
          parent process's mount namespace.

       *  If the namespace is created using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/unshare.2.html">unshare(2)</a>, the mount list
          of the new namespace is a copy of the mount list in the
          caller's previous mount namespace.

       Subsequent modifications to the mount list (<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mount.2.html">mount(2)</a> and
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/umount.2.html">umount(2)</a>) in either mount namespace will not (by default) affect
       the mount list seen in the other namespace (but see the following
       discussion of shared subtrees).
