       <b>fsck.fat </b>verifies the consistency of MS-DOS filesystems and
       optionally tries to repair them.

       The following filesystem problems can be corrected (in this
       order):

       •   FAT contains invalid cluster numbers.  Cluster is changed to
           EOF.

       •   File's cluster chain contains a loop.  The loop is broken.

       •   Bad clusters (read errors).  The clusters are marked bad and
           they are removed from files owning them.  This check is
           optional.

       •   Directories with a large number of bad entries (probably
           corrupt).  The directory can be deleted.

       •   Files . and .. are non-directories.  They can be deleted or
           renamed.

       •   Directories . and .. in root directory.  They are deleted.

       •   Bad filenames.  They can be renamed.

       •   Duplicate directory entries.  They can be deleted or renamed.

       •   Directories with non-zero size field.  Size is set to zero.

       •   Directory . does not point to parent directory.  The start
           pointer is adjusted.

       •   Directory .. does not point to parent of parent directory.
           The start pointer is adjusted.

       •   . and .. are not the two first entries in a non-root
           directory.  The entries are created, moving occupied slots if
           necessary.

       •   Start cluster number of a file is invalid.  The file is
           truncated.

       •   File contains bad or free clusters.  The file is truncated.

       •   File's cluster chain is longer than indicated by the size
           fields.  The file is truncated.

       •   Two or more files share the same cluster(s).  All but one of
           the files are truncated.  If the file being truncated is a
           directory file that has already been read, the filesystem
           check is restarted after truncation.

       •   File's cluster chain is shorter than indicated by the size
           fields.  The file is truncated.

       •   Volume label in root directory or label in boot sector is
           invalid.  Invalid labels are removed.

       •   Volume label in root directory and label in boot sector are
           different.  Volume label from root directory is copied to
           boot sector.

       •   Clusters are marked as used but are not owned by a file.
           They are marked as free.

       Additionally, the following problems are detected, but not
       repaired:

       •   Invalid parameters in boot sector

       When <b>fsck.fat </b>checks a filesystem, it accumulates all changes in
       memory and performs them only after all checks are complete.
       This can be disabled with the <b>-w </b>option.

       Two different variants of the FAT filesystem are supported.
       Standard is the FAT12, FAT16 and FAT32 filesystems as defined by
       Microsoft and widely used on hard disks and removable media like
       USB sticks and SD cards.  The other is the legacy Atari variant
       used on Atari ST.

       There are some minor differences in Atari format: Some boot
       sector fields are interpreted slightly different, and the special
       FAT entries for end-of-file and bad cluster can be different.
       Under MS-DOS 0xfff8 is used for EOF and Atari employs 0xffff by
       default, but both systems recognize all values from 0xfff8–0xffff
       as end-of-file.  MS-DOS uses only 0xfff7 for bad clusters, where
       on Atari values 0xfff0–0xfff7 are for this purpose (but the
       standard value is still 0xfff7).
