       <b>rpm2archive </b>converts the .rpm files specified as arguments to tar
       files.  By default they are gzip compressed and saved with
       postfix ".tgz".

       If '-' is given as argument, an rpm stream is read from standard
       in and written to standard out.

       In opposite to <b>rpm2cpio rpm2archive </b>also works with RPM packages
       containing files greater than 4GB which are not supported by
       cpio.  Unless <b>rpm2cpio rpm2archive </b>needs a working rpm
       installation which limits its usefulness for some disaster
       recovery scenarios.
