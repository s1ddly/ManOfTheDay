<pre>
       <b>mysqld_safe </b>is the recommended way to start a <b>mysqld </b>server on
       Unix.  <b>mysqld_safe </b>adds some safety features such as restarting
       the server when an error occurs and logging runtime information
       to an error log file. Descriptions of error logging is given
       later in this section.

       <b>mysqld_safe </b>tries to start an executable named <b>mysqld</b>. To
       override the default behavior and specify explicitly the name of
       the server you want to run, specify a <b>--mysqld </b>or
       <b>--mysqld-version </b>option to <b>mysqld_safe</b>. You can also use <b>--ledir</b>
       to indicate the directory where <b>mysqld_safe </b>should look for the
       server.

       Many of the options to <b>mysqld_safe </b>are the same as the options to
       <b>mysqld</b>.

       Options unknown to <b>mysqld_safe </b>are passed to <b>mysqld </b>if they are
       specified on the command line, but ignored if they are specified
       in the [mysqld_safe] or [mariadb_safe] groups of an option file.

       <b>mysqld_safe </b>reads all options from the [mysqld], [server],
       [mysqld_safe], and [mariadb_safe] sections in option files. For
       example, if you specify a [mysqld] section like this, <b>mysqld_safe</b>
       will find and use the <b>--log-error </b>option:

           [mysqld]
           log-error=error.log

       For backward compatibility, <b>mysqld_safe </b>also reads [safe_mysqld]
       sections, although you should rename such sections to
       [mysqld_safe] in current installations.

       <b>mysqld_safe </b>supports the options in the following list. It also
       reads option files and supports the options for processing them.

       •   <b>--help</b>

           Display a help message and exit.

       •   <b>--basedir=</b><i>path</i>

           The path to the MariaDB installation directory.

       •   <b>--core-file-size=</b><i>size</i>

           The size of the core file that <b>mysqld </b>should be able to
           create. The option value is passed to <b>ulimit -c</b>.

       •   <b>--crash-script=</b><i>file</i>

           Script to call in the event of mysqld crashing.

       •   <b>--datadir=</b><i>path</i>

           The path to the data directory.

       •   <b>--defaults-extra-file=</b><i>path</i>

           The name of an option file to be read in addition to the
           usual option files. This must be the first option on the
           command line if it is used. If the file does not exist or is
           otherwise inaccessible, the server will exit with an error.

       •   <b>--defaults-file=</b><i>file_name</i>

           The name of an option file to be read instead of the usual
           option files. This must be the first option on the command
           line if it is used.

       •   <b>--flush-caches</b>

           Flush and purge buffers/caches before starting the server.

       •   <b>--ledir=</b><i>path</i>

           If <b>mysqld_safe </b>cannot find the server, use this option to
           indicate the path name to the directory where the server is
           located.

       •   <b>--log-error=</b><i>file_name</i>

           Write the error log to the given file.

       •   <b>--malloc-lib=</b><i>lib</i>

           Preload shared library lib if available.

       •   <b>--mysqld=</b><i>prog_name</i>

           The name of the server program (in the ledir directory) that
           you want to start. This option is needed if you use the
           MariaDB binary distribution but have the data directory
           outside of the binary distribution. If <b>mysqld_safe </b>cannot
           find the server, use the <b>--ledir </b>option to indicate the path
           name to the directory where the server is located.

       •   <b>--mysqld-version=</b><i>suffix</i>

           This option is similar to the <b>--mysqld </b>option, but you
           specify only the suffix for the server program name. The
           basename is assumed to be <b>mysqld</b>. For example, if you use
           <b>--mysqld-version=debug</b>, <b>mysqld_safe </b>starts the <b>mysqld-debug</b>
           program in the ledir directory. If the argument to
           <b>--mysqld-version </b>is empty, <b>mysqld_safe </b>uses <b>mysqld </b>in the
           ledir directory.

       •   <b>--nice=</b><i>priority</i>

           Use the nice program to set the server´s scheduling priority
           to the given value.

       •   <b>--no-auto-restart</b>

           Exit after starting mysqld.

       •   <b>--no-defaults</b>

           Do not read any option files. This must be the first option
           on the command line if it is used.

       •   <b>--no-auto-restart</b>

           Exit after starting mysqld.

       •   <b>--numa-interleave</b>

           Run mysqld with its memory interleaved on all NUMA nodes.

       •   <b>--open-files-limit=</b><i>count</i>

           The number of files that <b>mysqld </b>should be able to open. The
           option value is passed to <b>ulimit -n</b>. Note that you need to
           start <b>mysqld_safe </b>as root for this to work properly!

       •   <b>--pid-file=</b><i>file_name</i>

           The path name of the process ID file.

       •   <b>--plugin-dir=</b><i>dir_name</i>

           Directory for client-side plugins.

       •   <b>--port=</b><i>port_num</i>

           The port number that the server should use when listening for
           TCP/IP connections. The port number must be 1024 or higher
           unless the server is started by the root system user.

       •   <b>--skip-kill-mysqld</b>

           Do not try to kill stray <b>mysqld </b>processes at startup. This
           option works only on Linux.

       •   <b>--socket=</b><i>path</i>

           The Unix socket file that the server should use when
           listening for local connections.

       •   <b>--syslog</b>, <b>--skip-syslog</b>

           <b>--syslog </b>causes error messages to be sent to syslog on
           systems that support the <b>logger </b>program.  --skip-syslog
           suppresses the use of syslog; messages are written to an
           error log file.

       •   <b>--syslog-tag=</b><i>tag</i>

           For logging to syslog, messages from <b>mysqld_safe </b>and <b>mysqld</b>
           are written with a tag of mysqld_safe and mysqld,
           respectively. To specify a suffix for the tag, use
           <b>--syslog-tag=</b><i>tag</i>, which modifies the tags to be
           mysqld_safe-<i>tag</i> and mysqld-<i>tag</i>.

       •   <b>--timezone=</b><i>timezone</i>

           Set the TZ time zone environment variable to the given option
           value. Consult your operating system documentation for legal
           time zone specification formats.

       •   <b>--user={</b><i>user_name</i><b>|</b><i>user_id</i><b>}</b>

           Run the <b>mysqld </b>server as the user having the name <i>user_name</i>
           or the numeric user ID <i>user_id</i>. (“User” in this context
           refers to a system login account, not a MariaDB user listed
           in the grant tables.)

       If you execute <b>mysqld_safe </b>with the <b>--defaults-file </b>or
       <b>--defaults-extra-file </b>option to name an option file, the option
       must be the first one given on the command line or the option
       file will not be used. For example, this command will not use the
       named option file:

           mysql&gt; <b>mysqld_safe --port=</b><i>port_num</i> <b>--defaults-file=</b><i>file_name</i>

       Instead, use the following command:

           mysql&gt; <b>mysqld_safe --defaults-file=</b><i>file_name</i> <b>--port=</b><i>port_num</i>

       The <b>mysqld_safe </b>script is written so that it normally can start a
       server that was installed from either a source or a binary
       distribution of MariaDB, even though these types of distributions
       typically install the server in slightly different locations.
       <b>mysqld_safe </b>expects one of the following conditions to be true:

       •   The server and databases can be found relative to the working
           directory (the directory from which <b>mysqld_safe </b>is invoked).
           For binary distributions, <b>mysqld_safe </b>looks under its working
           directory for bin and data directories. For source
           distributions, it looks for libexec and var directories. This
           condition should be met if you execute <b>mysqld_safe </b>from your
           MariaDB installation directory (for example, /usr/local/mysql
           for a binary distribution).

       •   If the server and databases cannot be found relative to the
           working directory, <b>mysqld_safe </b>attempts to locate them by
           absolute path names. Typical locations are /usr/local/libexec
           and /usr/local/var. The actual locations are determined from
           the values configured into the distribution at the time it
           was built. They should be correct if MariaDB is installed in
           the location specified at configuration time.

       Because <b>mysqld_safe </b>tries to find the server and databases
       relative to its own working directory, you can install a binary
       distribution of MariaDB anywhere, as long as you run <b>mysqld_safe</b>
       from the MariaDB installation directory:

           shell&gt; <b>cd </b><i>mysql_installation_directory</i>
           shell&gt; <b>bin/mysqld_safe &amp;</b>

       If <b>mysqld_safe </b>fails, even when invoked from the MariaDB
       installation directory, you can specify the <b>--ledir </b>and <b>--datadir</b>
       options to indicate the directories in which the server and
       databases are located on your system.

       When you use <b>mysqld_safe </b>to start <b>mysqld</b>, <b>mysqld_safe </b>arranges
       for error (and notice) messages from itself and from <b>mysqld </b>to go
       to the same destination.

       There are several <b>mysqld_safe </b>options for controlling the
       destination of these messages:

       •   <b>--syslog</b>: Write error messages to syslog on systems that
           support the <b>logger </b>program.

       •   <b>--skip-syslog</b>: Do not write error messages to syslog.
           Messages are written to the default error log file
           (<i>host_name</i>.err in the data directory), or to a named file if
           the <b>--log-error </b>option is given.

       •   <b>--log-error=</b><i>file_name</i>: Write error messages to the named
           error file.

       If none of these options is given, the default is <b>--skip-syslog</b>.

           <b>Note</b>
       If <b>--syslog </b>and <b>--log-error </b>are both given, a warning is issued
       and <b>--log-error </b>takes precedence.

       When <b>mysqld_safe </b>writes a message, notices go to the logging
       destination (syslog or the error log file) and stdout. Errors go
       to the logging destination and stderr.

       Normally, you should not edit the <b>mysqld_safe </b>script. Instead,
       configure <b>mysqld_safe </b>by using command-line options or options in
       the [mysqld_safe] section of a my.cnf option file. In rare cases,
       it might be necessary to edit <b>mysqld_safe </b>to get it to start the
       server properly. However, if you do this, your modified version
       of <b>mysqld_safe </b>might be overwritten if you upgrade MariaDB in the
       future, so you should make a copy of your edited version that you
       can reinstall.

       On NetWare, <b>mysqld_safe </b>is a NetWare Loadable Module (NLM) that
       is ported from the original Unix shell script. It starts the
       server as follows:

        1. Runs a number of system and option checks.

        2. Runs a check on MyISAM tables.

        3. Provides a screen presence for the MariaDB server.

        4. Starts <b>mysqld</b>, monitors it, and restarts it if it terminates
           in error.

        5. Sends error messages from <b>mysqld </b>to the <i>host_name</i>.err file in
           the data directory.

        6. Sends <b>mysqld_safe </b>screen output to the <i>host_name</i>.safe file in
           the data directory.
