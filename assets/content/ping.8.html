       <b>ping </b>uses the ICMP protocol's mandatory ECHO_REQUEST datagram to
       elicit an ICMP ECHO_RESPONSE from a host or gateway. ECHO_REQUEST
       datagrams (“pings”) have an IP and ICMP header, followed by a
       struct timeval and then an arbitrary number of “pad” bytes used
       to fill out the packet.

       <b>ping </b>works with both IPv4 and IPv6. Using only one of them
       explicitly can be enforced by specifying <b>-4 </b>or <b>-6</b>.

       <b>ping </b>can also send IPv6 Node Information Queries (RFC4620).
       Intermediate <i>hop</i>s may not be allowed, because IPv6 source routing
       was deprecated (RFC5095).
