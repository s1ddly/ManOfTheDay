       <b>systemd-firstboot </b>initializes the most basic system settings
       interactively on the first boot, or optionally non-interactively
       when a system image is created. The service is started if
       <i>ConditionFirstBoot=yes</i> is satisfied. This essentially means that
       /etc/ is empty, see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/systemd.unit.5.html">systemd.unit(5)</a> for details.

       The following settings may be set up:

       •   The system locale, more specifically the two locale variables
           <i>LANG=</i> and <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>

       •   The system keyboard map

       •   The system time zone

       •   The system hostname

       •   The machine ID of the system

       •   The root user's password

       Each of the fields may either be queried interactively by users,
       set non-interactively on the tool's command line, or be copied
       from a host system that is used to set up the system image.

       If a setting is already initialized, it will not be overwritten
       and the user will not be prompted for the setting.

       Note that this tool operates directly on the file system and does
       not involve any running system services, unlike <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/localectl.1.html">localectl(1)</a>,
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/timedatectl.1.html">timedatectl(1)</a> or <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/hostnamectl.1.html">hostnamectl(1)</a>. This allows <b>systemd-firstboot</b>
       to operate on mounted but not booted disk images and in early
       boot. It is not recommended to use <b>systemd-firstboot </b>on the
       running system while it is up.
