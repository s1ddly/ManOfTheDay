       The <b>mesg </b>utility is invoked by a user to control write access
       others have to the terminal device associated with standard error
       output. If write access is allowed, then programs such as <b>talk</b>(1)
       and <b>write</b>(1) may display messages on the terminal.

       Traditionally, write access is allowed by default. However, as
       users become more conscious of various security risks, there is a
       trend to remove write access by default, at least for the primary
       login shell. To make sure your ttys are set the way you want them
       to be set, <b>mesg </b>should be executed in your login scripts.

       The <b>mesg </b>utility silently exits with error status 2 if not
       executed on terminal. In this case execute <b>mesg </b>is pointless. The
       command line option <b>--verbose </b>forces mesg to print a warning in
       this situation. This behaviour has been introduced in version
       2.33.
