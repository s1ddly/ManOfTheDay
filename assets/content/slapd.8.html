       <b>Slapd </b>is the stand-alone LDAP daemon. It listens for LDAP
       connections on any number of ports (default <b>389</b>), responding to
       the LDAP operations it receives over these connections.  <b>slapd </b>is
       typically invoked at boot time, usually out of <b>/etc/rc.local</b>.
       Upon startup, <b>slapd </b>normally forks and disassociates itself from
       the invoking tty.  If configured in the config file (or config
       directory), the <b>slapd </b>process will print its process ID (see
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getpid.2.html">getpid(2)</a>) to a <b>.pid </b>file, as well as the command line options
       during invocation to an <b>.args </b>file (see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/slapd.conf.5.html">slapd.conf(5)</a>).  If the
       <b>-d </b>flag is given, even with a zero argument, <b>slapd </b>will not fork
       and disassociate from the invoking tty.

       See the "OpenLDAP Administrator's Guide" for more details on
       <b>slapd</b>.
