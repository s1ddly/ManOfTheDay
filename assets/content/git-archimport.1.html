       Imports a project from one or more GNU Arch repositories. It will
       follow branches and repositories within the namespaces defined by
       the &lt;archive/branch&gt; parameters supplied. If it cannot find the
       remote branch a merge comes from it will just import it as a
       regular commit. If it can find it, it will mark it as a merge
       whenever possible (see discussion below).

       The script expects you to provide the key roots where it can
       start the import from an <i>initial import</i> or <i>tag</i> type of Arch
       commit. It will follow and import new branches within the
       provided roots.

       It expects to be dealing with one project only. If it sees
       branches that have different roots, it will refuse to run. In
       that case, edit your &lt;archive/branch&gt; parameters to define
       clearly the scope of the import.

       <i>git archimport</i> uses <b>tla </b>extensively in the background to access
       the Arch repository. Make sure you have a recent version of <b>tla</b>
       available in the path. <b>tla </b>must know about the repositories you
       pass to <i>git archimport</i>.

       For the initial import, <i>git archimport</i> expects to find itself in
       an empty directory. To follow the development of a project that
       uses Arch, rerun <i>git archimport</i> with the same parameters as the
       initial import to perform incremental imports.

       While <i>git archimport</i> will try to create sensible branch names for
       the archives that it imports, it is also possible to specify Git
       branch names manually. To do so, write a Git branch name after
       each &lt;archive/branch&gt; parameter, separated by a colon. This way,
       you can shorten the Arch branch names and convert Arch jargon to
       Git jargon, for example mapping a "PROJECT--devo--VERSION" branch
       to "master".

       Associating multiple Arch branches to one Git branch is possible;
       the result will make the most sense only if no commits are made
       to the first branch, after the second branch is created. Still,
       this is useful to convert Arch repositories that had been rotated
       periodically.
