       <b>uconv </b>converts, or transcodes, each given <i>file</i> (or its standard
       input if no <i>file</i> is specified) from one <i>encoding</i> to another.  The
       transcoding is done using Unicode as a pivot encoding (i.e. the
       data are first transcoded from their original encoding to
       Unicode, and then from Unicode to the destination encoding).

       If an <i>encoding</i> is not specified or is <b>-</b>, the default encoding is
       used. Thus, calling <b>uconv </b>with no <i>encoding</i> provides an easy way
       to validate and sanitize data files for further consumption by
       tools requiring data in the default encoding.

       When calling <b>uconv</b>, it is possible to specify callbacks that are
       used to handle invalid characters in the input, or characters
       that cannot be transcoded to the destination encoding. Some
       encodings, for example, offer a default substitution character
       that can be used to represent the occurrence of such characters
       in the input. Other callbacks offer a useful visual
       representation of the invalid data.

       <b>uconv </b>can also run the specified <i>transliteration</i> on the
       transcoded data, in which case transliteration will happen as an
       intermediate step, after the data have been transcoded to
       Unicode.  The <i>transliteration</i> can be either a list of semicolon-
       separated transliterator names, or an arbitrarily complex set of
       rules in the ICU transliteration rules format.

       For transcoding purposes, <b>uconv </b>options are compatible with those
       of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/iconv.1.html">iconv(1)</a>, making it easy to replace it in scripts. It is not
       necessarily the case, however, that the encoding names used by
       <b>uconv </b>and ICU are the same as the ones used by <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/iconv.1.html">iconv(1)</a>.  Also,
       options that provide informational data, such as the <b>-l</b>, <b>--list</b>
       one offered by some <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/iconv.1.html">iconv(1)</a> variants such as GNU's, produce data
       in a slightly different and easier to parse format.
