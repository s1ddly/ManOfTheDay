       Cleans the working tree by recursively removing files that are
       not under version control, starting from the current directory.

       Normally, only files unknown to Git are removed, but if the <b>-x</b>
       option is specified, ignored files are also removed. This can,
       for example, be useful to remove all build products.

       If any optional <b>&lt;path&gt;... </b>arguments are given, only those paths
       are affected.
