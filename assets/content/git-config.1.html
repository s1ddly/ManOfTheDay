       You can query/set/replace/unset options with this command. The
       name is actually the section and the key separated by a dot, and
       the value will be escaped.

       Multiple lines can be added to an option by using the <b>--add</b>
       option. If you want to update or unset an option which can occur
       on multiple lines, a <b>value-pattern </b>(which is an extended regular
       expression, unless the <b>--fixed-value </b>option is given) needs to be
       given. Only the existing values that match the pattern are
       updated or unset. If you want to handle the lines that do <b>not</b>
       match the pattern, just prepend a single exclamation mark in
       front (see also the section called “EXAMPLES”), but note that
       this only works when the <b>--fixed-value </b>option is not in use.

       The <b>--type=&lt;type&gt; </b>option instructs <i>git config</i> to ensure that
       incoming and outgoing values are canonicalize-able under the
       given &lt;type&gt;. If no <b>--type=&lt;type&gt; </b>is given, no canonicalization
       will be performed. Callers may unset an existing <b>--type </b>specifier
       with <b>--no-type</b>.

       When reading, the values are read from the system, global and
       repository local configuration files by default, and options
       <b>--system</b>, <b>--global</b>, <b>--local</b>, <b>--worktree </b>and <b>--file &lt;filename&gt; </b>can
       be used to tell the command to read from only that location (see
       the section called “FILES”).

       When writing, the new value is written to the repository local
       configuration file by default, and options <b>--system</b>, <b>--global</b>,
       <b>--worktree</b>, <b>--file &lt;filename&gt; </b>can be used to tell the command to
       write to that location (you can say <b>--local </b>but that is the
       default).

       This command will fail with non-zero status upon error. Some exit
       codes are:

       •   The section or key is invalid (ret=1),

       •   no section or name was provided (ret=2),

       •   the config file is invalid (ret=3),

       •   the config file cannot be written (ret=4),

       •   you try to unset an option which does not exist (ret=5),

       •   you try to unset/set an option for which multiple lines match
           (ret=5), or

       •   you try to use an invalid regexp (ret=6).

       On success, the command returns the exit code 0.
