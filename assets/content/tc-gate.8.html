       GATE action allows specified ingress frames can be passed at
       specific time slot, or be dropped at specific time slot. Tc
       filter filters the ingress frames, then tc gate action would
       specify which time slot and how many bytes these frames can be
       passed to device and which time slot frames would be dropped.
       Gate action also assign a base-time to tell when the entry list
       start.  Then gate action would start to repeat the gate entry
       list cyclically at the start base-time.  For the software
       simulation, gate action requires the user assign reference time
       clock type.
