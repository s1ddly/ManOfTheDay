       Repair a flatpak installation by pruning and reinstalling invalid
       objects. The repair command does all of the following:

       •   Scan all locally available refs, removing any that don't
           correspond to a deployed ref.

       •   Verify each commit they point to, removing any invalid
           objects and noting any missing objects.

       •   Remove any refs that had an invalid object, and any
           non-partial refs that had missing objects.

       •   Prune all objects not referenced by a ref, which gets rid of
           any possibly invalid non-scanned objects.

       •   Enumerate all deployed refs and re-install any that are not
           in the repo (or are partial for a non-subdir deploy).

       Note that <b>flatpak repair </b>has to be run with root privileges to
       operate on the system installation.

       An alternative command for repairing OSTree repositories is
       ostree fsck.
