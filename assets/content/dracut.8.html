       Create an initramfs &lt;image&gt; for the kernel with the version
       &lt;kernel version&gt;. If &lt;kernel version&gt; is omitted, then the
       version of the actual running kernel is used. If &lt;image&gt; is
       omitted or empty, then the default location
       /boot/initramfs-&lt;kernel version&gt;.img is used.

       dracut creates an initial image used by the kernel for preloading
       the block device modules (such as IDE, SCSI or RAID) which are
       needed to access the root filesystem, mounting the root
       filesystem and booting into the real system.

       At boot time, the kernel unpacks that archive into RAM disk,
       mounts and uses it as initial root file system. All finding of
       the root device happens in this early userspace.

       Initramfs images are also called "initrd".

       For a complete list of kernel command line options see
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/dracut.cmdline.7.html">dracut.cmdline(7)</a>.

       If you are dropped to an emergency shell, while booting your
       initramfs, the file <i>/run/initramfs/rdsosreport.txt</i> is created,
       which can be saved to a (to be mounted by hand) partition
       (usually /boot) or a USB stick. Additional debugging info can be
       produced by adding <b>rd.debug </b>to the kernel command line.
       <i>/run/initramfs/rdsosreport.txt</i> contains all logs and the output
       of some tools. It should be attached to any report about dracut
       problems.
