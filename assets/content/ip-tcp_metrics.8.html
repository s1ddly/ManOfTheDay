       <b>ip tcp_metrics </b>is used to manipulate entries in the kernel that
       keep TCP information for IPv4 and IPv6 destinations. The entries
       are created when TCP sockets want to share information for
       destinations and are stored in a cache keyed by the destination
       address. The saved information may include values for metrics
       (initially obtained from routes), recent TSVAL for TIME-WAIT
       recycling purposes, state for the Fast Open feature, etc.  For
       performance reasons the cache can not grow above configured limit
       and the older entries are replaced with fresh information,
       sometimes reclaimed and used for new destinations. The kernel
       never removes entries, they can be flushed only with this tool.

   <b>ip tcp_metrics show - show cached entries</b>
       <b>address </b><i>PREFIX</i> <b>(default)</b>
              IPv4/IPv6 prefix or address. If no prefix is provided all
              entries are shown.

       The output may contain the following information:

       <b>age </b><i>&lt;S.MMM&gt;</i><b>sec </b>- time after the entry was created, reset or
       updated with metrics from sockets. The entry is reset and
       refreshed on use with metrics from route if the metrics are not
       updated in last hour. Not all cached values reset the age on
       update.

       <b>cwnd </b><i>&lt;N&gt;</i> - CWND metric value

       <b>fo_cookie </b><i>&lt;HEX-STRING&gt;</i> - Cookie value received in SYN-ACK to be
       used by Fast Open for next SYNs

       <b>fo_mss </b><i>&lt;N&gt;</i> - MSS value received in SYN-ACK to be used by Fast
       Open for next SYNs

       <b>fo_syn_drops </b><i>&lt;N&gt;/&lt;S.MMM&gt;</i><b>sec ago </b>- Number of drops of initial
       outgoing Fast Open SYNs with data detected by monitoring the
       received SYN-ACK after SYN retransmission.  The seconds show the
       time after last SYN drop and together with the drop count can be
       used to disable Fast Open for some time.

       <b>reordering </b><i>&lt;N&gt;</i> - Reordering metric value

       <b>rtt </b><i>&lt;N&gt;</i><b>us </b>- RTT metric value

       <b>rttvar </b><i>&lt;N&gt;</i><b>us </b>- RTTVAR metric value

       <b>ssthresh </b><i>&lt;SSTHRESH&gt;</i> - SSTHRESH metric value

       <b>tw_ts </b><i>&lt;TSVAL&gt;/&lt;SEC&gt;</i><b>sec ago </b>- recent TSVAL and the seconds after
       saving it into TIME-WAIT socket

   <b>ip tcp_metrics delete - delete single entry</b>
       <b>address </b><i>ADDRESS</i> <b>(default)</b>
              IPv4/IPv6 address. The address is a required argument.

   <b>ip tcp_metrics flush - flush entries</b>
       This command flushes the entries selected by some criteria.

       This command has the same arguments as <b>show.</b>
