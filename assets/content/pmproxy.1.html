       <b>pmproxy </b>acts as a protocol proxy, allowing Performance Co-Pilot
       (PCP) monitoring clients to connect to one or more <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> and/or
       <b>redis-server</b>(1) instances via <b>pmproxy</b>.

       In its default mode of operation, on platforms supporting this,
       <b>pmproxy </b>provides the REST API for all PCP services (see
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/PMWEBAPI.3.html">PMWEBAPI(3)</a> for details) and interfaces to the fast, scalable
       time series query capabilities offered by PCP in conjunction with
       a <b>redis-server</b>(1) (see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmseries.1.html">pmseries(1)</a> for details).

       <b>pmproxy </b>can be deployed in a firewall domain, or on a cluster
       ``head'' node where the IP (Internet Protocol) address of the
       hosts where <b>pmcd </b>and/or <b>redis-server </b>are running may be unknown
       to the PCP monitoring clients, but where the IP address of the
       host running <b>pmproxy </b>is known to these clients.  Similarly, the
       clients may have network connectivity only to the host where
       <b>pmproxy </b>is running, while there is network connectivity from that
       host to the hosts of interest where <b>pmcd </b>and/or <b>redis-server </b>are
       running.

       The behaviour of the PCP monitoring clients is controlled by
       either the <b>PMPROXY_HOST </b>environment variable or through the
       extended hostname specification (see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/PCPIntro.1.html">PCPIntro(1)</a> for details).
       If neither of these mechanisms is used, clients will make their
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/PMAPI.3.html">PMAPI(3)</a> connections directly to <b>pmcd</b>.  If the proxy hostname
       syntax is used or <b>PMPROXY_HOST </b>is set, then this should be the
       hostname or IP address of the system where <b>pmproxy </b>is running,
       and the clients will connect to <b>pmcd </b>or <b>redis-server </b>indirectly
       through the protocol proxy services of <b>pmproxy.</b>
