       <b>dh_installemacsen </b>is a debhelper program that is responsible for
       installing files used by the Debian <b>emacsen-common </b>package into
       package build directories.

       It also automatically generates the <i>preinst postinst</i> and <i>prerm</i>
       commands needed to register a package as an Emacs add on package.
       The commands are added to the maintainer scripts by
       <b>dh_installdeb</b>. See <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dh_installdeb.1.html">dh_installdeb(1)</a> for an explanation of how
       this works.
