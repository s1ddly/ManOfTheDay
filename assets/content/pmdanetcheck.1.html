       <b>pmdanetcheck </b>is a Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) Performance Metrics
       Domain Agent (PMDA) which does basic network checks on the local
       host by using simple Python modules and, in some cases, external
       utilities such as <b>ping</b>(1).

       <b>pmdanetcheck </b>loads and acts as a bridge for any number of
       configured, separate PCP netcheck PMDA Python modules running
       Python code or external programs.  Existing Python modules and
       programs should be possible to be utilized with PCP netcheck PMDA
       modules with minimal effort.

       Note that on SELinux enabled systems for <b>pmdanetcheck </b>to be able
       to use the <b>ping</b>(1) command the <b>pcp </b>group must be able to create
       ICMP Echo sockets; please make sure the group id for <b>pcp </b>is
       included in the range at <i>/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ping_group_range</i> and
       refer to <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/icmp.7.html">icmp(7)</a> for more details on this.
