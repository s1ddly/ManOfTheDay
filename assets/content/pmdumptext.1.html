       <b>pmdumptext </b>outputs the values of performance metrics collected
       live or from a set of Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) archives.  By
       default, the metric values are displayed in tab separated
       columns, prefixed by a timestamp.

       Unless directed to another host by the <b>-h </b>option, or to one or
       more sets of archives by the <b>-a </b>option, or an explict host: or
       archive/ prefix in the <i>metric</i> (see below for more information),
       <b>pmdumptext </b>will contact the Performance Metrics Collector Daemon
       (PMCD) on the local host to obtain the required information.

       <b>pmdumptext </b>may be run in interactive mode with the <b>-i </b>option
       which displays the values in equal width columns.  Without this
       option, no attempt is made to line up any values allowing the
       output to be easily parsed by other applications.

       The format of the output can be further controlled by changing
       the precision of the values with <b>-P</b>, the width of the columns
       with <b>-w</b>, and the format of the values with the <b>-G </b>and <b>-F </b>options
       for the shortest of scientific or fixed digits, and a fixed width
       format, respectively.

       The <i>metrics</i> to be dumped can be listed on the command line, in a
       <i>config</i> file, or piped to <b>pmdumptext </b>on <i>stdin</i>.  A metric consists
       of an optional source (host or archive), the metric name, and an
       optional instance list immediately after the name.  A colon is
       used to separate a host name from the metric, and a forward slash
       (``/'') to separate an archive name from the metric.  Instances
       are enclosed in square brackets and a comma is used between each
       instance if more than one is stated.  For example, some legal
       metrics are:

               kernel.all.cpu.idle
               myhost:kernel.all.cpu.idle[cpu0,cpu3]
               /path/to/myarchive/kernel.all.cpu.idle[cpu1]

       When a <i>metric</i> does not contain a host: or archive/ prefix, e.g.
       kernel.all.cpu.idle above, then the source of the metric is
       determined by the following rules:
       (a) PMCD on <i>host</i> from the <b>-h </b>option if any, else
       (b) the <i>archive</i> from the first <b>-a </b>option if any, else
       (c) the host from the first <i>metric</i> prior to this one with a host:
           prefix if any, else
       (d) the archive from the first <i>metric</i> prior to this one with an
           archive/ prefix if any, else
       (e) PMCD on the local host, which is equivalent to local::<i>metric</i>.

       The format of a <i>metric</i> is further described in <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/PCPIntro.1.html">PCPIntro(1)</a> in the
       PERFORMANCE METRIC SPECIFICATIONS section.  A normalization value
       may optionally follow a metric name in a <i>config</i> file or on <i>stdin</i>.
       The metric value will be scaled by this value.  For example, if
       the file system ``/dev/root'' has a capacity of 1965437 bytes,
       then the percentage of the file system that is used could be
       dumped with this <i>config</i>:

               filesys.used[/dev/root] 19654.37

       A normalization value may not be used with <i>metrics</i> specified as
       command line arguments.

       A metric name is not required to be a leaf node in the
       Performance Metrics Name Space (PMNS), except when one or more
       instances are specified.  For example, to dump all file system
       metrics, only <i>filesys</i> is required to dump <i>filesys.capacity</i>,
       <i>filesys.used</i>, <i>filesys.free</i> etc.
