       The <b>ip l2tp </b>commands are used to establish static, or so-called
       <i>unmanaged</i> L2TPv3 ethernet tunnels. For unmanaged tunnels, there
       is no L2TP control protocol so no userspace daemon is required -
       tunnels are manually created by issuing commands at a local
       system and at a remote peer.

       L2TPv3 is suitable for Layer-2 tunneling. Static tunnels are
       useful to establish network links across IP networks when the
       tunnels are fixed. L2TPv3 tunnels can carry data of more than one
       session. Each session is identified by a session_id and its
       parent tunnel's tunnel_id. A tunnel must be created before a
       session can be created in the tunnel.

       When creating an L2TP tunnel, the IP address of the remote peer
       is specified, which can be either an IPv4 or IPv6 address. The
       local IP address to be used to reach the peer must also be
       specified. This is the address on which the local system will
       listen for and accept received L2TP data packets from the peer.

       L2TPv3 defines two packet encapsulation formats: UDP or IP. UDP
       encapsulation is most common. IP encapsulation uses a dedicated
       IP protocol value to carry L2TP data without the overhead of UDP.
       Use IP encapsulation only when there are no NAT devices or
       firewalls in the network path.

       When an L2TPv3 ethernet session is created, a virtual network
       interface is created for the session, which must then be
       configured and brought up, just like any other network interface.
       When data is passed through the interface, it is carried over the
       L2TP tunnel to the peer. By configuring the system's routing
       tables or adding the interface to a bridge, the L2TP interface is
       like a virtual wire (pseudowire) connected to the peer.

       Establishing an unmanaged L2TPv3 ethernet pseudowire involves
       manually creating L2TP contexts on the local system and at the
       peer. Parameters used at each site must correspond or no data
       will be passed. No consistency checks are possible since there is
       no control protocol used to establish unmanaged L2TP tunnels.
       Once the virtual network interface of a given L2TP session is
       configured and enabled, data can be transmitted, even if the peer
       isn't yet configured. If the peer isn't configured, the L2TP data
       packets will be discarded by the peer.

       To establish an unmanaged L2TP tunnel, use <b>l2tp add tunnel </b>and
       <b>l2tp add session </b>commands described in this document. Then
       configure and enable the tunnel's virtual network interface, as
       required.

       Note that unmanaged tunnels carry only ethernet frames. If you
       need to carry PPP traffic (L2TPv2) or your peer doesn't support
       unmanaged L2TPv3 tunnels, you will need an L2TP server which
       implements the L2TP control protocol. The L2TP control protocol
       allows dynamic L2TP tunnels and sessions to be established and
       provides for detecting and acting upon network failures.
