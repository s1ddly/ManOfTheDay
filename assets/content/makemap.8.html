     Maps provide a generic interface for associating a textual key to a
     value.  Such associations may be accessed through a plaintext file,
     database, or DNS.  The format of these file types is described
     below.  <b>makemap </b>itself creates the database maps used by keyed map
     lookups specified in smtpd.conf(5).

     <b>makemap </b>reads input from <i>file</i> and writes data to a file which is
     named by adding a “.db” suffix to <i>file</i>.  The current line can be
     extended over multiple lines using a backslash (‘\’).  Comments can
     be put anywhere in the file using a hash mark (‘#’), and extend to
     the end of the current line.  Care should be taken when commenting
     out multi-line text: the comment is effective until the end of the
     entire block.  In all cases, <b>makemap </b>reads lines consisting of
     words separated by whitespace.  The first word of a line is the
     database key; the remainder represents the mapped value.  The
     database key and value may optionally be separated by the colon
     character.

     The options are as follows:

     <b>-d </b><i>dbtype</i>
             Specify the format of the database.  Available formats are
             <i>hash</i> and <i>btree</i>.  The default value is <i>hash</i>.

     <b>-o </b><i>dbfile</i>
             Write the generated database to <i>dbfile</i>.

     <b>-t </b><i>type</i>
             Specify the format of the resulting map file.  The default
             map format is suitable for storing simple, unstructured,
             key-to-value string associations.  However, if the mapped
             value has special meaning, as in the case of a virtual
             domains file, a suitable <i>type</i> must be provided.  The
             available output types are:

             <b>aliases  </b>The mapped value is a comma-separated list of mail
                      destinations.  This format can be used for
                      building user aliases and user mappings for
                      virtual domain files.

             <b>set      </b>There is no mapped value – a map of this type will
                      only allow for the lookup of keys.  This format
                      can be used for building primary domain maps.

     <b>-U      </b>Instead of generating a database map from text input, dump
             the contents of a database map as text with the key and
             value separated with a tab.
