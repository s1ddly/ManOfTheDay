       The trace-cmd(1) stop is a complement to <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/trace-cmd-start.1.html">trace-cmd-start(1)</a>. This
       will disable Ftrace from writing to the ring buffer. This does
       not stop the overhead that the tracing may incur. Only the
       updating of the ring buffer is disabled, the Ftrace tracing may
       still be inducing overhead.

       After stopping the trace, the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/trace-cmd-extract.1.html">trace-cmd-extract(1)</a> may strip out
       the data from the ring buffer and create a trace.dat file. The
       Ftrace pseudo file system may also be examined.

       To disable the tracing completely to remove the overhead it
       causes, use <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/trace-cmd-reset.1.html">trace-cmd-reset(1)</a>. But after a reset is performed,
       the data that has been recorded is lost.
