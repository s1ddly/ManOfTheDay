       The <b>run </b>command creates a Babeltrace 2 trace processing graph and
       runs it.

       See <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/babeltrace2-intro.7.html">babeltrace2-intro(7)</a> to learn more about the Babeltrace 2
       project and its core concepts.

       The <b>run </b>command dynamically loads Babeltrace 2 plugins which
       supply component classes. With the <b>run </b>command, you specify which
       component classes to instantiate as components and how to connect
       them.

       The steps to write a <b>babeltrace2 run </b>command line are:

        1. Specify which component classes to instantiate as components
           with many <b>--component </b>options and how to configure them.

           This is the <i>COMPONENTS</i> part of the synopsis. See “Create
           components” to learn more.

        2. Specify how to connect components together with one or more
           <b>--connect </b>options.

           See “Connect components” to learn more.

           <b>Note</b>
           The <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/babeltrace2-convert.1.html">babeltrace2-convert(1)</a> command is a specialization of the
           <b>run </b>command for the very common case of converting one or
           more traces: it generates a <b>run </b>command line and executes it.
           You can use its <b>--run-args </b>or <b>--run-args-0 </b>option to make it
           print the equivalent <b>run </b>command line instead.

   <b>Create components</b>
       To create a component, use the <b>--component </b>option. This option
       specifies:

       •   The name of the component, unique amongst all the component
           names of the trace processing graph.

       •   The type of the component class to instantiate: source,
           filter, or sink.

       •   The name of the plugin in which to find the component class
           to instantiate.

       •   The name of the component class to instantiate.

       Use the <b>--component </b>option multiple times to create multiple
       components. You can instantiate the same component class multiple
       times as different components.

       At any point in the command line, the <b>--base-params </b>sets the
       current base initialization parameters and the <b>--reset-base-</b>
       <b>params </b>resets them. When you specify a <b>--component </b>option, its
       initial initialization parameters are a copy of the current base
       initialization parameters.

       Immediately following a <b>--component </b>option on the command line,
       the created component is known as the <i>current component</i> (until
       the next <b>--component </b>option).

       The <b>--params</b>=<i>PARAMS</i> option adds parameters to the current
       component’s initialization parameters. If <i>PARAMS</i> contains a key
       which exists in the current component’s initialization
       parameters, this parameter is replaced.

   <b>Connect components</b>
       The components which you create from component classes with the
       <b>--component </b>option (see “Create components”) add input and output
       <i>ports</i> depending on their type. An output port is from where
       messages, like trace events, are sent. An input port is where
       messages are received. For a given component, each port has a
       unique name.

       The purpose of the <b>run </b>command is to create a trace processing
       graph, that is, to know which component ports to connect
       together. The command achieves this with the help of the
       connection rules that you provide with one or more
       <b>--connect</b>=<i>CONN-RULE</i> options.

       The format of <i>CONN-RULE</i> is:

           <i>UP-COMP-PAT</i>[.<i>UP-PORT-PAT</i>]:<i>DOWN-COMP-PAT</i>[.<i>DOWN-PORT-PAT</i>]

       <i>UP-COMP-PAT</i>
           Upstream component name pattern.

       <i>UP-PORT-PAT</i>
           Upstream (output) port name pattern.

       <i>DOWN-COMP-PAT</i>
           Downstream component name pattern.

       <i>DOWN-PORT-PAT</i>
           Downstream (input) port name pattern.

       When a source or filter component adds a new output port within
       the processing graph, the <b>run </b>command does the following to find
       an input port to connect it to:

           For each connection rule (--connect options, in order):
             If the output port's component's name matches UP-COMP-PAT and the
             output port's name matches UP-PORT-PAT:
               For each component COMP in the trace processing graph:
                 If the name of COMP matches DOWN-COMP-PAT:
                   Select the first input port of COMP of which the name matches
                   DOWN-PORT-PAT, or fail with no match.

           No possible connection: fail with no match.

       <i>UP-COMP-PAT</i>, <i>UP-PORT-PAT</i>, <i>DOWN-COMP-PAT</i>, and <i>DOWN-PORT-PAT</i> are
       globbing patterns where only the wildcard character, <b>*</b>, is
       special: it matches zero or more characters. You must escape the
       <b>*</b>, <b>?</b>, <b>[</b>, <b>.</b>, <b>:</b>, and <b>\ </b>characters with <b>\</b>.

       When you do not specify <i>UP-PORT-PAT</i> or <i>DOWN-PORT-PAT</i>, they are
       equivalent to <b>*</b>.

       You can leverage this connection mechanism to specify fallbacks
       with a careful use of wildcards, as the order of the <b>--connect</b>
       options on the command line is significant. For example:

           --connect='A.out*:B.in*' --connect=A:B --connect='*:C'

       With those connection rules, the <b>run </b>command connects:

       •   Any output port of which the name starts with <b>out </b>of
           component <b>A </b>to the first input port of which the name starts
           with <b>in </b>of component <b>B</b>.

       •   Any other output port of component <b>A </b>to the first available
           input port of component <b>B</b>.

       •   Any other output port (of any component except <b>A</b>) to the
           first available input port of component <b>C</b>.

       The <b>run </b>command fails when it cannot find an input port to which
       to connect a given output port using the provided connection
       rules.
