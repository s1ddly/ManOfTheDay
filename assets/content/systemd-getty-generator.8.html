       systemd-getty-generator is a generator that automatically
       instantiates serial-getty@.service on the kernel console(s), if
       they can function as ttys and are not provided by the virtual
       console subsystem. It will also instantiate serial-getty@.service
       instances for virtualizer consoles, if execution in a virtualized
       environment is detected. If execution in a container environment
       is detected, it will instead enable console-getty.service for
       /dev/console, and container-getty@.service instances for
       additional container pseudo TTYs as requested by the container
       manager (see <b>Container Interface</b><b></b>[1]). This should ensure that the
       user is shown a login prompt at the right place, regardless of
       which environment the system is started in. For example, it is
       sufficient to redirect the kernel console with a kernel command
       line argument such as <i>console=</i> to get both kernel messages and a
       getty prompt on a serial TTY. See <b>kernel-parameters.txt</b><b></b>[2] for
       more information on the <i>console=</i> kernel parameter.

       systemd-getty-generator implements <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/systemd.generator.7.html">systemd.generator(7)</a>.
