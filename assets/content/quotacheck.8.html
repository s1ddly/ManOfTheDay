       <b>quotacheck </b>examines each filesystem, builds a table of current
       disk usage, and compares this table against that recorded in the
       disk quota file for the filesystem (this step is omitted if
       option <b>-c </b>is specified). If any inconsistencies are detected,
       both the quota file and the current system copy of the incorrect
       quotas are updated (the latter only occurs if an active
       filesystem is checked which is not advised).  By default, only
       user quotas are checked.  <b>quotacheck </b>expects each filesystem to
       be checked to have quota files named <i>[a]quota.user</i> and
       <i>[a]quota.group</i> located at the root of the associated filesystem.
       If a file is not present, <b>quotacheck </b>will create it.

       If the quota file is corrupted, <b>quotacheck </b>tries to save as much
       data as possible.  Rescuing data may need user intervention. With
       no additional options <b>quotacheck </b>will simply exit in such a
       situation. When in interactive mode (option <b>-i</b>) , the user is
       asked for advice. Advice can also be provided from command line
       (see option <b>-n</b>) , which is useful when <b>quotacheck </b>is run
       automatically (ie. from script) and failure is unacceptable.

       <b>quotacheck </b>should be run each time the system boots and mounts
       non-valid filesystems.  This is most likely to happen after a
       system crash.

       It is strongly recommended to run <b>quotacheck </b>with quotas turned
       off for the filesystem. Otherwise, possible damage or loss to
       data in the quota files can result.  It is also unwise to run
       <b>quotacheck </b>on a live filesystem as actual usage may change during
       the scan.  To prevent this, <b>quotacheck </b>tries to remount the
       filesystem read-only before starting the scan.  After the scan is
       done it remounts the filesystem read-write. You can disable this
       with option <b>-m</b>.  You can also make <b>quotacheck </b>ignore the failure
       to remount the filesystem read-only with option <b>-M</b>.
