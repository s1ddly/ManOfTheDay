       Updates files in the working tree to match the version in the
       index or the specified tree. If no pathspec was given, <i>git</i>
       <i>checkout</i> will also update <b>HEAD </b>to set the specified branch as the
       current branch.

       <i>git checkout</i> [&lt;branch&gt;]
           To prepare for working on <b>&lt;branch&gt;</b>, switch to it by updating
           the index and the files in the working tree, and by pointing
           <b>HEAD </b>at the branch. Local modifications to the files in the
           working tree are kept, so that they can be committed to the
           <b>&lt;branch&gt;</b>.

           If <b>&lt;branch&gt; </b>is not found but there does exist a tracking
           branch in exactly one remote (call it <b>&lt;remote&gt;</b>) with a
           matching name and <b>--no-guess </b>is not specified, treat as
           equivalent to

               $ git checkout -b &lt;branch&gt; --track &lt;remote&gt;/&lt;branch&gt;

           You could omit <b>&lt;branch&gt;</b>, in which case the command
           degenerates to "check out the current branch", which is a
           glorified no-op with rather expensive side-effects to show
           only the tracking information, if exists, for the current
           branch.

       <i>git checkout</i> -b|-B &lt;new_branch&gt; [&lt;start point&gt;]
           Specifying <b>-b </b>causes a new branch to be created as if
           <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/git-branch.1.html">git-branch(1)</a> were called and then checked out. In this case
           you can use the <b>--track </b>or <b>--no-track </b>options, which will be
           passed to <i>git branch</i>. As a convenience, <b>--track </b>without <b>-b</b>
           implies branch creation; see the description of <b>--track</b>
           below.

           If <b>-B </b>is given, <b>&lt;new_branch&gt; </b>is created if it doesnâ€™t exist;
           otherwise, it is reset. This is the transactional equivalent
           of

               $ git branch -f &lt;branch&gt; [&lt;start point&gt;]
               $ git checkout &lt;branch&gt;

           that is to say, the branch is not reset/created unless "git
           checkout" is successful.

       <i>git checkout</i> --detach [&lt;branch&gt;], <i>git checkout</i> [--detach]
       &lt;commit&gt;
           Prepare to work on top of <b>&lt;commit&gt;</b>, by detaching <b>HEAD </b>at it
           (see "DETACHED HEAD" section), and updating the index and the
           files in the working tree. Local modifications to the files
           in the working tree are kept, so that the resulting working
           tree will be the state recorded in the commit plus the local
           modifications.

           When the <b>&lt;commit&gt; </b>argument is a branch name, the <b>--detach</b>
           option can be used to detach <b>HEAD </b>at the tip of the branch
           (<b>git checkout &lt;branch&gt; </b>would check out that branch without
           detaching <b>HEAD</b>).

           Omitting <b>&lt;branch&gt; </b>detaches <b>HEAD </b>at the tip of the current
           branch.

       <i>git checkout</i> [-f|--ours|--theirs|-m|--conflict=&lt;style&gt;]
       [&lt;tree-ish&gt;] [--] &lt;pathspec&gt;..., <i>git checkout</i>
       [-f|--ours|--theirs|-m|--conflict=&lt;style&gt;] [&lt;tree-ish&gt;]
       --pathspec-from-file=&lt;file&gt; [--pathspec-file-nul]
           Overwrite the contents of the files that match the pathspec.
           When the <b>&lt;tree-ish&gt; </b>(most often a commit) is not given,
           overwrite working tree with the contents in the index. When
           the <b>&lt;tree-ish&gt; </b>is given, overwrite both the index and the
           working tree with the contents at the <b>&lt;tree-ish&gt;</b>.

           The index may contain unmerged entries because of a previous
           failed merge. By default, if you try to check out such an
           entry from the index, the checkout operation will fail and
           nothing will be checked out. Using <b>-f </b>will ignore these
           unmerged entries. The contents from a specific side of the
           merge can be checked out of the index by using <b>--ours </b>or
           <b>--theirs</b>. With <b>-m</b>, changes made to the working tree file can
           be discarded to re-create the original conflicted merge
           result.

       <i>git checkout</i> (-p|--patch) [&lt;tree-ish&gt;] [--] [&lt;pathspec&gt;...]
           This is similar to the previous mode, but lets you use the
           interactive interface to show the "diff" output and choose
           which hunks to use in the result. See below for the
           description of <b>--patch </b>option.
