       A Babeltrace 2 <b>sink.utils.counter </b>component prints to the
       standard output the number of messages it consumes with a count
       for each type.

                       +--------------------+
                       | sink.utils.counter |
                       |                    +--&gt; Statistics to the
           Messages --&gt;@ in                 |    standard output
                       +--------------------+

       See <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/babeltrace2-intro.7.html">babeltrace2-intro(7)</a> to learn more about the Babeltrace 2
       project and its core concepts.

       The component’s output looks like this:

                   3842964 Event messages
                         4 Stream beginning messages
                         1 Stream end messages
                        18 Packet beginning messages
                        14 Packet end messages
                       189 Discarded event messages
                         0 Discarded packet messages
                         3 Message iterator inactivity messages
                   3843000 messages (TOTAL)

       By default, a <b>sink.utils.counter </b>component prints a new block of
       statistics every 1000 consumed messages, whatever their types.
       You can use the <b>step </b>parameter to override this default period.

       The component always prints a block of statistics when there’s no
       more messages to consume from its upstream message iterator and
       the last block was different.

       By default, a <b>sink.utils.counter </b>component prints the count of
       messages for each type, even if this count is 0. You can make it
       hide the zero counts with the <b>hide-zero </b>parameter.
