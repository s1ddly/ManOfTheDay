       The <b>pcp-atopsar </b>program can be used to report statistics at the
       system level.

       In the first synopsis line (no sampling interval specified), <b>pcp-</b>
       <b>atopsar </b>extracts data from a raw logfile that has been recorded
       previously by <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> (or via the <b>-w </b>option of the <b>pcp-atop</b>
       program).
       You can specify the name of the logfile with the <b>-r </b>option of the
       <b>pcp-atopsar </b>program.  When a <b>pmlogger </b>daily logfile is used,
       named <b>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmlogger/[host]/YYYYMMDD </b>(where YYYYMMDD
       reflects the date), the required date of the form YYYYMMDD can be
       specified with the <b>-r </b>option instead of the filename, or the
       symbolic name 'y' can be used for yesterday's daily logfile (this
       can be repeated so 'yyyy' indicates the logfile of four days
       ago).  If the <b>-r </b>option is not specified at all, today's daily
       logfile is used by default.
       By default, the hostname of the localhost will be used when
       resolving <b>pmlogger </b>archives, however an alternative <i>host</i> can be
       specified using the <b>-h </b>option.
       The starting and ending times of the report can be defined using
       the options <b>-b </b>and <b>-e </b>followed by a time argument of the form
       [yy-mm-dd] hh:mm.

       In the second synopsis line, <b>pcp-atopsar </b>reads actual activity
       counters from the kernel with the specified <i>interval</i> (in seconds)
       and the specified number of <i>samples</i> (optionally).  When <b>pcp-</b>
       <b>atopsar </b>is activated in this way it immediately sends the output
       for every requested report to standard output.  If only one type
       of report is requested, the header is printed once and after
       every <i>interval</i> seconds the statistical counters are shown for
       that period.  If several reports are requested, a header is
       printed per sample followed by the statistical counters for that
       period.

       When invoked via the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pcp.1.html">pcp(1)</a> command, the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/PCPIntro.1.html">PCPIntro(1)</a> options
       <b>-h</b>/<b>--host</b>, <b>-a</b>/<b>--archive</b>, <b>-O</b>/<b>--origin</b>, <b>-s</b>/<b>--samples</b>,
       <b>-t</b>/<b>--interval</b>, <b>-Z</b>/<b>--timezone </b>and several other <i>pcp options</i> become
       indirectly available, see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/PCPIntro.1.html">PCPIntro(1)</a> for their descriptions.

       Some generic flags can be specified to influence the behaviour of
       the <b>pcp-atopsar </b>program:

       <b>-S   </b>By default the timestamp at the beginning of a line is
            suppressed if more lines are shown for one interval. With
            this flag a timestamp is given for every output-line (easier
            for post-processing).

       <b>-a   </b>By default certain resources as disks and network interfaces
            are only shown when they were active during the interval.
            With this flag all resources of a given type are shown, even
            if they were inactive during the interval.

       <b>-x   </b>By default <b>pcp-atopsar </b>only uses colors if output is
            directed to a terminal (window).  These colors might
            indicate that a critical occupation percentage has been
            reached (red) or has been almost reached (cyan) for a
            particular resource.  See the man-page of <b>atop </b>for a
            detailed description of this feature (section COLORS).
            With the flag <b>-x </b>the use of colors is suppressed
            unconditionally.

       <b>-C   </b>By default <b>pcp-atopsar </b>only uses colors if output is
            directed to a terminal (window).  These colors might
            indicate that a critical occupation percentage has been
            reached (red) or has been almost reached (cyan) for a
            particular resource.  See the man-page of <b>atop </b>for a
            detailed description of this feature (section COLORS).
            With the flag <b>-C </b>colors will always be used, even if output
            is not directed to a terminal.

       <b>-M   </b>Use markers at the end of a line to indicate that a critical
            occupation percentage has been reached ('*') or has been
            almost reached ('+') for particular resources. The marker
            '*' is similar to the color red and the marker '+' to the
            color cyan. See the man-page of <b>atop </b>for a detailed
            description of these colors (section COLORS).

       <b>-H   </b>Repeat the header line within a report for every <i>N</i> detail
            lines. The value of <i>N</i> is determined dynamically in case of
            output to a tty/window (depending on the number of lines);
            for output to a file or pipe this value is 23.

       <b>-R   </b>Summarize <i>cnt</i> samples into one sample. When the logfile
            contains e.g. samples of 10 minutes, the use of the flag '-R
            6' shows a report with one sample for every hour.

       Other flags are used to define which reports are required:

       <b>-A   </b>Show all possible reports.

       <b>-c   </b>Report about CPU utilization (in total and per cpu).

       <b>-g   </b>Report about GPU utilization (per GPU).

       <b>-p   </b>Report about processor-related matters, like load-averages
            and hardware interrupts.

       <b>-P   </b>Report about processes.

       <b>-m   </b>Current memory- and swap-occupation.

       <b>-s   </b>Report about paging- and swapping-activity, and
            overcommitment.

       <b>-B   </b>Report about Pressure Stall Information (PSI).

       <b>-l   </b>Report about utilization of logical volumes.

       <b>-f   </b>Report about utilization of multiple devices.

       <b>-d   </b>Report about utilization of disks.
