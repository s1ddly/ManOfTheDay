       <i>ip rule</i> manipulates rules in the routing policy database control
       the route selection algorithm.

       Classic routing algorithms used in the Internet make routing
       decisions based only on the destination address of packets (and
       in theory, but not in practice, on the TOS field).

       In some circumstances we want to route packets differently
       depending not only on destination addresses, but also on other
       packet fields: source address, IP protocol, transport protocol
       ports or even packet payload.  This task is called 'policy
       routing'.

       To solve this task, the conventional destination based routing
       table, ordered according to the longest match rule, is replaced
       with a 'routing policy database' (or RPDB), which selects routes
       by executing some set of rules.

       Each policy routing rule consists of a <b>selector </b>and an <b>action</b>
       <b>predicate.  </b>The RPDB is scanned in order of decreasing priority
       (note that lower number means higher priority, see the
       description of <i>PREFERENCE</i> below). The selector of each rule is
       applied to {source address, destination address, incoming
       interface, tos, fwmark} and, if the selector matches the packet,
       the action is performed. The action predicate may return with
       success.  In this case, it will either give a route or failure
       indication and the RPDB lookup is terminated. Otherwise, the RPDB
       program continues with the next rule.

       Semantically, the natural action is to select the nexthop and the
       output device.

       At startup time the kernel configures the default RPDB consisting
       of three rules:

       1.     Priority: 0, Selector: match anything, Action: lookup
              routing table <b>local </b>(ID 255).  The <b>local </b>table is a
              special routing table containing high priority control
              routes for local and broadcast addresses.

       2.     Priority: 32766, Selector: match anything, Action: lookup
              routing table <b>main </b>(ID 254).  The <b>main </b>table is the normal
              routing table containing all non-policy routes. This rule
              may be deleted and/or overridden with other ones by the
              administrator.

       3.     Priority: 32767, Selector: match anything, Action: lookup
              routing table <b>default </b>(ID 253).  The <b>default </b>table is
              empty. It is reserved for some post-processing if no
              previous default rules selected the packet.  This rule may
              also be deleted.

       Each RPDB entry has additional attributes. F.e. each rule has a
       pointer to some routing table. NAT and masquerading rules have an
       attribute to select new IP address to translate/masquerade.
       Besides that, rules have some optional attributes, which routes
       have, namely <b>realms</b>.  These values do not override those
       contained in the routing tables. They are only used if the route
       did not select any attributes.

       The RPDB may contain rules of the following types:

              <b>unicast </b>- the rule prescribes to return the route found in
              the routing table referenced by the rule.

              <b>blackhole </b>- the rule prescribes to silently drop the
              packet.

              <b>unreachable </b>- the rule prescribes to generate a 'Network
              is unreachable' error.

              <b>prohibit </b>- the rule prescribes to generate 'Communication
              is administratively prohibited' error.

              <b>nat </b>- the rule prescribes to translate the source address
              of the IP packet into some other value.

       <b>ip rule add - insert a new rule</b>

       <b>ip rule delete - delete a rule</b>

              <b>type </b><i>TYPE</i> <b>(default)</b>
                     the type of this rule. The list of valid types was
                     given in the previous subsection.

              <b>from </b><i>PREFIX</i>
                     select the source prefix to match.

              <b>to </b><i>PREFIX</i>
                     select the destination prefix to match.

              <b>iif </b><i>NAME</i>
                     select the incoming device to match. If the
                     interface is loopback, the rule only matches
                     packets originating from this host. This means that
                     you may create separate routing tables for
                     forwarded and local packets and, hence, completely
                     segregate them.

              <b>oif </b><i>NAME</i>
                     select the outgoing device to match. The outgoing
                     interface is only available for packets originating
                     from local sockets that are bound to a device.

              <b>tos </b><i>TOS</i>

              <b>dsfield </b><i>TOS</i>
                     select the TOS value to match.

              <b>fwmark </b><i>MARK</i>
                     select the <b>fwmark </b>value to match.

              <b>uidrange </b><i>NUMBER-NUMBER</i>
                     select the <b>uid </b>value to match.

              <b>ipproto </b><i>PROTOCOL</i>
                     select the ip protocol value to match.

              <b>sport </b><i>NUMBER | NUMBER-NUMBER</i>
                     select the source port value to match. supports
                     port range.

              <b>dport </b><i>NUMBER | NUMBER-NUMBER</i>
                     select the destination port value to match.
                     supports port range.

              <b>priority </b><i>PREFERENCE</i>
                     the priority of this rule.  <i>PREFERENCE</i> is an
                     unsigned integer value, higher number means lower
                     priority, and rules get processed in order of
                     increasing number. Each rule should have an
                     explicitly set <i>unique</i> priority value.  The options
                     preference and order are synonyms with priority.

              <b>table </b><i>TABLEID</i>
                     the routing table identifier to lookup if the rule
                     selector matches.  It is also possible to use
                     lookup instead of table.

              <b>protocol </b><i>PROTO</i>
                     the routing protocol who installed the rule in
                     question.  As an example when zebra installs a rule
                     it would get RTPROT_ZEBRA as the installing
                     protocol.

              <b>suppress_prefixlength </b><i>NUMBER</i>
                     reject routing decisions that have a prefix length
                     of NUMBER or less.

              <b>suppress_ifgroup </b><i>GROUP</i>
                     reject routing decisions that use a device
                     belonging to the interface group GROUP.

              <b>realms </b><i>FROM/TO</i>
                     Realms to select if the rule matched and the
                     routing table lookup succeeded. Realm <i>TO</i> is only
                     used if the route did not select any realm.

              <b>nat </b><i>ADDRESS</i>
                     The base of the IP address block to translate (for
                     source addresses).  The <i>ADDRESS</i> may be either the
                     start of the block of NAT addresses (selected by
                     NAT routes) or a local host address (or even zero).
                     In the last case the router does not translate the
                     packets, but masquerades them to this address.
                     Using map-to instead of nat means the same thing.

                     <b>Warning: </b>Changes to the RPDB made with these
                     commands do not become active immediately. It is
                     assumed that after a script finishes a batch of
                     updates, it flushes the routing cache with <b>ip route</b>
                     <b>flush cache</b>.

       <b>ip rule flush - also dumps all the deleted rules.</b>

              <b>protocol </b><i>PROTO</i>
                     Select the originating protocol.

       <b>ip rule show - list rules</b>
              This command has no arguments.  The options list or lst
              are synonyms with show.

       <b>ip rule save</b>

              <b>protocol </b><i>PROTO</i>
                     Select the originating protocol.

       save rules table information to stdout
              This command behaves like <b>ip rule show </b>except that the
              output is raw data suitable for passing to <b>ip rule</b>
              <b>restore</b>.

       <b>ip rule restore</b>
              restore rules table information from stdin
              This command expects to read a data stream as returned
              from <b>ip rule save</b>.  It will attempt to restore the rules
              table information exactly as it was at the time of the
              save. Any rules already in the table are left unchanged,
              and duplicates are not ignored.
