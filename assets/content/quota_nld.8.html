       <b>quota_nld </b>listens on netlink socket and processes received quota
       warnings. By default <b>quota_nld </b>forwards warning messages to both
       the system's DBUS (so that the desktop manager can display a
       dialog) and the last-accessed terminal of the user to whom each
       warning is directed. Either of these destinations can be disabled
       with the <b>-D </b>and <b>-C </b>options, respectively.

       In the case of the user's terminal, quota messages about falling
       below the hard and soft limits are not sent unless the <b>-b </b>option
       is specified. In the case of the DBUS, all quota messages are
       sent.

       Note, that you have to enable the kernel support for sending
       quota messages over netlink (in Filesystems-&gt;Quota menu).
