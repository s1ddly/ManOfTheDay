       The <i>unexpand</i> utility shall copy files or standard input to
       standard output, converting &lt;blank&gt; characters at the beginning
       of each line into the maximum number of &lt;tab&gt; characters followed
       by the minimum number of &lt;space&gt; characters needed to fill the
       same column positions originally filled by the translated &lt;blank&gt;
       characters. By default, tabstops shall be set at every eighth
       column position. Each &lt;backspace&gt; shall be copied to the output,
       and shall cause the column position count for tab calculations to
       be decremented; the count shall never be decremented to a value
       less than one.
