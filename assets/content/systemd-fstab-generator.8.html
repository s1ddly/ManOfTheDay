       systemd-fstab-generator is a generator that translates /etc/fstab
       (see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/fstab.5.html">fstab(5)</a> for details) into native systemd units early at
       boot and when configuration of the system manager is reloaded.
       This will instantiate mount and swap units as necessary.

       The <i>passno</i> field is treated like a simple boolean, and the
       ordering information is discarded. However, if the root file
       system is checked, it is checked before all the other file
       systems.

       See <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/systemd.mount.5.html">systemd.mount(5)</a> and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/systemd.swap.5.html">systemd.swap(5)</a> for more information
       about special /etc/fstab mount options this generator
       understands.

       One special topic is handling of symbolic links. Historical init
       implementations supported symlinks in /etc/fstab. Because mount
       units will refuse mounts where the target is a symbolic link,
       this generator will resolve any symlinks as far as possible when
       processing /etc/fstab in order to enhance backwards
       compatibility. If a symlink target does not exist at the time
       that this generator runs, it is assumed that the symlink target
       is the final target of the mount.
