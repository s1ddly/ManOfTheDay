       Many Git porcelainish commands take mixture of flags (i.e.
       parameters that begin with a dash <i>-</i>) and parameters meant for the
       underlying <i>git rev-list</i> command they use internally and flags and
       parameters for the other commands they use downstream of <i>git</i>
       <i>rev-list</i>. This command is used to distinguish between them.
