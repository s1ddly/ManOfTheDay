       This manual page documents the GNU version of <b>find</b>.  GNU <b>find</b>
       searches the directory tree rooted at each given starting-point
       by evaluating the given expression from left to right, according
       to the rules of precedence (see section OPERATORS), until the
       outcome is known (the left hand side is false for <i>and</i> operations,
       true for <i>or</i>), at which point <b>find </b>moves on to the next file name.
       If no starting-point is specified, `.' is assumed.

       If you are using <b>find </b>in an environment where security is
       important (for example if you are using it to search directories
       that are writable by other users), you should read the `Security
       Considerations' chapter of the findutils documentation, which is
       called <b>Finding Files </b>and comes with findutils.  That document
       also includes a lot more detail and discussion than this manual
       page, so you may find it a more useful source of information.
