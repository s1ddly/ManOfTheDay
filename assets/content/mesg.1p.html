       The <i>mesg</i> utility shall control whether other users are allowed to
       send messages via <i>write</i>, <i>talk</i>, or other utilities to a terminal
       device. The terminal device affected shall be determined by
       searching for the first terminal in the sequence of devices
       associated with standard input, standard output, and standard
       error, respectively. With no arguments, <i>mesg</i> shall report the
       current state without changing it. Processes with appropriate
       privileges may be able to send messages to the terminal
       independent of the current state.
