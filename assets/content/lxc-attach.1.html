       <b>lxc-attach </b>runs the specified <i>command</i> inside the container
       specified by <i>name</i>. The container has to be running already.

       If no <i>command</i> is specified, the current default shell of the user
       running <b>lxc-attach </b>will be looked up inside the container and
       executed. This will fail if no such user exists inside the
       container or the container does not have a working nsswitch
       mechanism.

       Previous versions of <b>lxc-attach </b>simply attached to the specified
       namespaces of a container and ran a shell or the specified
       command without first allocating a pseudo terminal. This made
       them vulnerable to input faking via a TIOCSTI <b>ioctl </b>call after
       switching between userspace execution contexts with different
       privilege levels. Newer versions of <b>lxc-attach </b>will try to
       allocate a pseudo terminal file descriptor pair on the host and
       attach any standard file descriptors which refer to a terminal to
       the container side of the pseudo terminal before executing a
       shell or command. Note, that if none of the standard file
       descriptors refer to a terminal <b>lxc-attach </b>will not try to
       allocate a pseudo terminal. Instead it will simply attach to the
       containers namespaces and run a shell or the specified command.
