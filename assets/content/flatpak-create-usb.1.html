       Copies the specified apps and/or runtimes REFs onto the removable
       media mounted at MOUNT-PATH, along with all the dependencies and
       metadata needed for installing them. This is one way of
       transferring flatpaks between computers that doesn't require an
       Internet connection. After using this command, the USB drive can
       be connected to another computer which already has the relevant
       remote(s) configured, and Flatpak will install or update from the
       drive offline (see below). If online, the drive will be used as a
       cache, meaning some objects will be pulled from it and others
       from the Internet. For this process to work a collection ID must
       be configured on the relevant remotes on both the source and
       destination computers, and on the remote server.

       On the destination computer one can install from the USB (or any
       mounted filesystem) using the <b>--sideload-repo </b>option with <b>flatpak</b>
       <b>install</b>. It's also possible to configure sideload paths using
       symlinks; see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/flatpak.1.html">flatpak(1)</a>. Flatpak also includes systemd units to
       automatically sideload from hot-plugged USB drives, but these may
       or may not be enabled depending on your Linux distribution.

       Each REF argument is a full or partial identifier in the flatpak
       ref format, which looks like "(app|runtime)/ID/ARCH/BRANCH". All
       elements except ID are optional and can be left out, including
       the slashes, so most of the time you need only specify ID. Any
       part left out will be matched against what is installed, and if
       there are multiple matches an error message will list the
       alternatives.

       By default this looks for both installed apps and runtimes with
       the given REF, but you can limit this by using the <b>--app </b>or
       <b>--runtime </b>option.

       All REFs must be in the same installation (user, system, or
       other). Otherwise it's ambiguous which repository metadata refs
       to put on the USB drive.

       By default <b>flatpak create-usb </b>uses .ostree/repo as the
       destination directory under MOUNT-PATH but if you specify another
       location using <b>--destination-repo </b>a symbolic link will be created
       for you in .ostree/repos.d. This ensures that either way the
       repository will be found by flatpak (and other consumers of
       libostree) for install/update operations.

       Unless overridden with the <b>--system</b>, <b>--user</b>, or <b>--installation</b>
       options, this command searches both the system-wide installation
       and the per-user one for REF and errors out if it exists in more
       than one.
