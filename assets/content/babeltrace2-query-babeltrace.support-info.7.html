       The <b>babeltrace.support-info </b>Babeltrace 2 query object indicates,
       for a given source component class, whether or not its instance
       can handle a given input, and if so, what’s the confidence of
       this support.

       Said input can be a simple string, an existing file path, or an
       existing directory path. Components which expect some form of URI
       can handle a string input, while components which expect an
       existing file or directory can handle a file/directory path
       input.

       When the source component class’s query method replies that its
       component can handle a given input, it can also specify the name
       of a group in which to put that input. All the inputs of a given
       group, for a given component class, should be passed when
       instantiating the component class as its <b>inputs </b>initialization
       parameter (array of strings).

       The <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/babeltrace2-convert.1.html">babeltrace2-convert(1)</a> command queries this object from
       specific source component classes to find the most appropriate
       for a given non-option argument.
