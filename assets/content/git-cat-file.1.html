       In its first form, the command provides the content or the type
       of an object in the repository. The type is required unless <b>-t </b>or
       <b>-p </b>is used to find the object type, or <b>-s </b>is used to find the
       object size, or <b>--textconv </b>or <b>--filters </b>is used (which imply type
       "blob").

       In the second form, a list of objects (separated by linefeeds) is
       provided on stdin, and the SHA-1, type, and size of each object
       is printed on stdout. The output format can be overridden using
       the optional <b>&lt;format&gt; </b>argument. If either <b>--textconv </b>or <b>--filters</b>
       was specified, the input is expected to list the object names
       followed by the path name, separated by a single whitespace, so
       that the appropriate drivers can be determined.
