<pre>
       Shows runtimes and applications that are available in the remote
       repository with the name REMOTE, or all remotes if one isn't
       specified. You can find all configured remote repositories with
       <b>flatpak remotes</b>.

       REMOTE can be a file:// URI pointing to a local repository
       instead of a remote name.

       Unless overridden with the <b>--system</b>, <b>--user</b>, or <b>--installation</b>
       options, this command uses either the default system-wide
       installation or the per-user one, depending on which has the
       specified REMOTE.
