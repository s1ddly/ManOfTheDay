       <b>losetup </b>is used to associate loop devices with regular files or
       block devices, to detach loop devices, and to query the status of
       a loop device. If only the <i>loopdev</i> argument is given, the status
       of the corresponding loop device is shown. If no option is given,
       all loop devices are shown.

       Note that the old output format (i.e., <b>losetup -a</b>) with
       comma-delimited strings is deprecated in favour of the <b>--list</b>
       output format.

       Itâ€™s possible to create more independent loop devices for the
       same backing file. <b>This setup may be dangerous, can cause data</b>
       <b>loss, corruption and overwrites. </b>Use <b>--nooverlap </b>with <b>--find</b>
       during setup to avoid this problem.

       The loop device setup is not an atomic operation when used with
       <b>--find</b>, and <b>losetup </b>does not protect this operation by any lock.
       The number of attempts is internally restricted to a maximum of
       16. It is recommended to use for example flock1 to avoid a
       collision in heavily parallel use cases.
