       For some probing operations, where DWARF debugging data is not
       available, systemtap needs ELF symbols for the relevant binaries.
       This allows at least probe addresses to be calculated, some
       variables resolved, and with @cast() and headers, maybe even some
       types.

       kernel symbol table
              Systemtap may need a linux-build style <b>System.map </b>file to
              find addresses of kernel functions/data.  It may be
              possible to create it by hand:

              % su
              # cp /proc/kallsyms /boot/System.map-`uname -r`
              or
              # nm /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build/vmlinux &gt; /boot/System.map-`uname -r`

       minisymbols
              On some systems, binaries may be compiled with a subset of
              symbols useful for function tracing and backtraces.  This
              'Minisymbols' is a xz compressed section labeled
              .gnu_debugdata.  Support for minisymbols relies on
              elfutils version 0.156 or later.

       compressed symbols
              On some systems, symbols may be available, but compressed
              into <i>.zdebug_*</i> sections.  Support for compressed symbols
              relies on elfutils version 0.153 or later.
