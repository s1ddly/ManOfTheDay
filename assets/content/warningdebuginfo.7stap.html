       For many symbolic probing operations, systemtap needs DWARF
       debuginfo for the relevant binaries.  This often includes
       resolving function/statement probes, or $context variables in
       related handlers.  DWARF debuginfo is created by the compiler
       when using <i>CFLAGS -g</i>, and may be found in the original binaries
       built during compilation, or may have been split into separate
       files.  The <i>SYSTEMTAP_DEBUGINFO_PATH</i> environment variable affects
       where systemtap looks for these files.

       If your operating system came from a distributor, check with them
       if debuginfo packages or variants are available.  If your
       distributor does not have debuginfo-equipped binaries at all, you
       may need to rebuild it.

       Systemtap uses the <i>elfutils</i> library to process ELF/DWARF files.
       The version of elfutils used by systemtap is the number after the
       slash in the <i>-V</i> output:

              % stap -V
              Systemtap translator/driver (version 4.2/0.178, rpm 4.2-1.fc30)
              Copyright (C) 2005-2019 Red Hat, Inc. and others
              [...]

       This indicates systemtap version 4.2 with elfutils version 0.178.

       New enough versions of elfutils (0.178+) enable systemtap to
       automatically download correct debuginfo from servers run by you,
       your organization, and/or someone on the public internet.  Try:

              % export DEBUGINFOD_URLS=https://debuginfod.elfutils.org/
              % export DEBUGINFOD_PROGRESS=1   # for progress messages, if you like

       and rerun systemtap.  It might just work.  If it doesn't, read
       on.

       kernel debuginfo
              For scripts that target the kernel, systemtap may search
              for the <i>vmlinux</i> file created during its original build.
              This is distinct from the boot-loader's
              compressed/stripped <i>vmlinuz</i> file, and much larger.  If you
              have a hand-built kernel, make sure it was built with the
              <i>CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO=y</i> option.  Some Linux distributions may
              include several kernel variants, including a confusingly
              named <i>kernel-debug</i> (an alternative kernel, with its own
              <i>kernel-debug-debuginfo</i> package), which is not the same
              thing as the <i>kernel-debuginfo</i> (DWARF data for the base
              <i>kernel</i>).  The <i>stap-prep</i> program can help install the right
              set.

       process debuginfo
              For scripts that target user-space, systemtap may search
              for debuginfo.  If you have hand-built binaries, use
              <i>CFLAGS=-g -O2</i> to compile them.

       minidebuginfo
              On some systems, binaries may be compiled with a subset of
              debuginfo useful for function tracing and backtraces.
              This 'Minidebuginfo' is a xz compressed section labeled
              .gnu_debugdata.  Support for minidebuginfo relies on
              elfutils version 0.156 or later.

       compressed debuginfo
              On some systems, debuginfo may be available, but
              compressed into <i>.zdebug_*</i> sections.  Support for
              compressed debuginfo relies on elfutils version 0.153 or
              later.

       unnecessary debuginfo
              In some cases, a script may be altered to avoid requiring
              debuginfo.  For example, as script that uses <i>probe</i>
              <i>syscall.*</i>  probes could try instead <i>probe nd_syscall.*</i>
              (for non-DWARF syscall): these work similarly, and use
              more intricate (fragile) tapset functions to extract
              system call arguments.  Another option is use of compiled-
              in instrumentation such as kernel tracepoints or user-
              space <i>&lt;sys/sdt.h&gt;</i> markers in libraries or executables,
              which do not require debuginfo.  If debuginfo was required
              for resolving a complicated <i>$var-&gt;foo-&gt;bar</i> expression, it
              may be possible to use <i>@cast(var,"foo","foo.h")-&gt;foo-&gt;bar</i>
              to synthesize debuginfo for that type from a header file.
