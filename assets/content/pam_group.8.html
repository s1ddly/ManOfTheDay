       The pam_group PAM module does not authenticate the user, but
       instead it grants group memberships (in the credential setting
       phase of the authentication module) to the user. Such memberships
       are based on the service they are applying for.

       By default rules for group memberships are taken from config file
       /etc/security/group.conf.

       This module's usefulness relies on the file-systems accessible to
       the user. The point being that once granted the membership of a
       group, the user may attempt to create a <b>setgid </b>binary with a
       restricted group ownership. Later, when the user is not given
       membership to this group, they can recover group membership with
       the precompiled binary. The reason that the file-systems that the
       user has access to are so significant, is the fact that when a
       system is mounted <i>nosuid</i> the user is unable to create or execute
       such a binary file. For this module to provide any level of
       security, all file-systems that the user has write access to
       should be mounted <i>nosuid</i>.

       The pam_group module functions in parallel with the /etc/group
       file. If the user is granted any groups based on the behavior of
       this module, they are granted <i>in addition</i> to those entries
       /etc/group (or equivalent).
