       The pfifo and bfifo qdiscs are unadorned First In, First Out
       queues. They are the simplest queues possible and therefore have
       no overhead.  <b>pfifo </b>constrains the queue size as measured in
       packets.  <b>bfifo </b>does so as measured in bytes.

       Like all non-default qdiscs, they maintain statistics. This might
       be a reason to prefer pfifo or bfifo over the default.
