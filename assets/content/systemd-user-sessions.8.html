       systemd-user-sessions.service is a service that controls user
       logins through <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/pam_nologin.8.html">pam_nologin(8)</a>. After basic system initialization
       is complete, it removes /run/nologin, thus permitting logins.
       Before system shutdown, it creates /run/nologin, thus prohibiting
       further logins.
