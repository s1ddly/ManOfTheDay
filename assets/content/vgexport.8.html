       vgexport changes a VG into the exported state, which ensures that
       the VG and its disks are not being used, and cannot be used until
       the VG is imported by <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/vgimport.8.html">vgimport(8)</a>.  Putting a VG into an
       unusable, offline state can be useful when doing things like
       moving a VG's disks to another system.  Exporting a VG provides
       some protection from its LVs being accidentally used, or being
       used by an automated system before it's ready.

       A VG cannot be exported until all of its LVs are inactive.

       LVM commands will ignore an exported VG or report an error if a
       command tries to use it.

       For an exported VG, the vgs command will display attribute, and
       the pvs command will display attribute.  Both vgs and pvs will
       display report field.

       vgexport clears the VG system ID, and vgimport sets the VG system
       ID to match the host running vgimport (if the host has a system
       ID).
