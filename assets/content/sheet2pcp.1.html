       <b>sheet2pcp </b>is intended to read a data spreadsheet (<i>infile</i>)
       translate this into a Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) archive with the
       basename <i>outfile</i>.

       The input spreadsheet can be in any of the common formats,
       provided the appropriate Perl modules have been installed (see
       the <b>CAVEATS </b>section below).  The spreadsheet must be
       ``normalized'' so that each row contains data for the same time
       interval, and one of the columns contains the date and time for
       the data in each row.

       The resultant PCP archive may be used with all the PCP client
       tools to graph subsets of the data using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmchart.1.html">pmchart(1)</a>, perform data
       reduction and reporting, filter with the PCP inference engine
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmie.1.html">pmie(1)</a>, etc.

       The <i>mapfile</i> controls the import process and defines the data
       mapping from the spreadsheet columns onto the PCP data model.
       The file is written in XML and conforms to the syntax defined in
       the <b>MAPPING CONFIGURATION </b>section below.

       A series of physical files will be created with the prefix
       <i>outfile</i>.  These are <i>outfile</i><b>.0 </b>(the performance data),
       <i>outfile</i><b>.meta </b>(the metadata that describes the performance data)
       and <i>outfile</i><b>.index </b>(a temporal index to improve efficiency of
       replay operations for the archive).  If any of these files exists
       already, then <b>sheet2pcp </b>will <b>not </b>overwrite them and will exit
       with an error message.

       The <b>-h </b>option is an alternate to the <b>hostname </b>attribute of the
       <b>&lt;sheet&gt; </b>element in <i>mapfile</i> described below.  If both are
       specified, the value from <i>mapfile</i> is used.

       The <b>-Z </b>option is an alternate to the <b>timezone </b>attribute of the
       <b>&lt;sheet&gt; </b>element in <i>mapfile</i> described below.  If both are
       specified, the value from <i>mapfile</i> is used.

       <b>sheet2pcp </b>is a Perl script that uses the PCP::LogImport Perl
       wrapper around the PCP <i>libpcp_import</i> library, and as such could
       be used as an example to develop new tools to import other types
       of performance data and create PCP archives.
