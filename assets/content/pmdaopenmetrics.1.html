       <b>pmdaopenmetrics </b>is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA)
       which dynamically creates PCP metrics from configured OpenMetrics
       endpoints, which provide HTTP based access to application
       metrics.  The PMDA essentially implements a bridge between
       <b>Prometheus </b>and <b>PCP</b>, allowing PCP to easily ingest performance
       data from more than 650 registered end-points and many other
       application specific end-points.

       The default <i>config</i> directory is
       <b>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/openmetrics/config.d/</b>, see ``CONFIGURATION
       SOURCES'' below.  The default URL fetch <i>timeout</i> is <b>2 </b>seconds.
       The default <i>user</i>, if not specified with the <b>-u </b>option, is the
       current user.  If the <b>-n </b>option is given, the list of
       configuration files will not be sorted prior to processing.  This
       list is sorted by default but that can be expensive if there are
       a large number of configuration files (URLs and/or scripts).

       If the <b>-D </b>option is given, additional diagnostic messages will be
       written to the PMDA log file, which is
       <b>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/openmetrics.log </b>by default (see also <b>-l</b>below).
       In addition, the metric <b>openmetrics.control.debug </b>controls the
       same debug flag and can be set with the following command:
            <b>pmstore openmetrics.control.debug </b><i>value</i>
       where <i>value</i> is either <b>1 </b>(to enable verbose log messages) or <b>0 </b>(to
       disable verbose log messages).  This is particularly useful for
       examining the http headers passed to each fetch request, filter
       settings and other processing details that are logged when the
       debugging flag is enabled.

       The <b>-d </b>option may be used to override the default performance
       metrics <i>domain</i> number, which defaults to <b>144.  </b>It is strongly
       recommended not to change this.  The <i>domain</i> number should be
       different for every PMDA on the one host, and the same <i>domain</i>
       number should be used for <b>pmdaopenmetrics </b>PMDA on all hosts.  See
       also the <b>-r </b>option, which allows the root of the dynamic
       namespace to be changed from the default <b>openmetrics</b>.

       The <b>-l </b>option may be used to specify <i>logfile</i> as the destination
       for PMDA messages instead of the default,
       <b>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/openmetrics.log</b>.  As a special case, <i>logfile</i>
       may be <b>"-" </b>to send messages to the <b>stderr </b>stream instead, e.g.
       <b>-l-</b>.  This would normally be the <b>stderr </b>stream for the parent
       process, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a>, which may itself have redirected <b>stderr</b>.  This
       redirection is normally most useful in a containerized
       environment, or when using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dbpmda.1.html">dbpmda(1)</a>.

       The <b>-r </b>option allows the root of the dynamic namespace to be
       changed to <i>root</i> from the default, <b>openmetrics</b>.  In conjunction
       with other command line options, this allows <b>pmdaopenmetrics </b>to
       be deployed as a different PMDA with distinct metrics namespace
       and metrics domain on the same host system.  Note that all PMDAs
       require a unique domain number so the <b>-d </b>option must also be
       specified.  Use of the <b>-r </b>option may also change the defaults for
       some other command line options, e.g. the default log file name
       and the default configuration directory.
