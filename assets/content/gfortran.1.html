       The <b>gfortran </b>command supports all the options supported by the
       <b>gcc </b>command.  Only options specific to GNU Fortran are documented
       here.

       All GCC and GNU Fortran options are accepted both by <b>gfortran </b>and
       by <b>gcc </b>(as well as any other drivers built at the same time, such
       as <b>g++</b>), since adding GNU Fortran to the GCC distribution enables
       acceptance of GNU Fortran options by all of the relevant drivers.

       In some cases, options have positive and negative forms; the
       negative form of <b>-ffoo </b>would be <b>-fno-foo</b>.  This manual documents
       only one of these two forms, whichever one is not the default.
