     <b>scp </b>copies files between hosts on a network.

     It uses ssh(1) for data transfer, and uses the same authentication
     and provides the same security as a login session.  The scp
     protocol requires execution of the remote user's shell to perform
     glob(3) pattern matching.

     <b>scp </b>will ask for passwords or passphrases if they are needed for
     authentication.

     The <i>source</i> and <i>target</i> may be specified as a local pathname, a
     remote host with optional path in the form [user@]host:[path], or a
     URI in the form scp://[user@]host[:port][/path].  Local file names
     can be made explicit using absolute or relative pathnames to avoid
     <b>scp </b>treating file names containing ‘:’ as host specifiers.

     When copying between two remote hosts, if the URI format is used, a
     <i>port</i> cannot be specified on the <i>target</i> if the <b>-R </b>option is used.

     The options are as follows:

     <b>-3      </b>Copies between two remote hosts are transferred through the
             local host.  Without this option the data is copied
             directly between the two remote hosts.  Note that, when
             using the legacy SCP protocol (the default), this option
             selects batch mode for the second host as <b>scp </b>cannot ask
             for passwords or passphrases for both hosts.  This mode is
             the default.

     <b>-4      </b>Forces <b>scp </b>to use IPv4 addresses only.

     <b>-6      </b>Forces <b>scp </b>to use IPv6 addresses only.

     <b>-A      </b>Allows forwarding of ssh-agent(1) to the remote system.
             The default is not to forward an authentication agent.

     <b>-B      </b>Selects batch mode (prevents asking for passwords or
             passphrases).

     <b>-C      </b>Compression enable.  Passes the <b>-C </b>flag to ssh(1) to enable
             compression.

     <b>-c </b><i>cipher</i>
             Selects the cipher to use for encrypting the data transfer.
             This option is directly passed to ssh(1).

     <b>-D </b><i>sftp_server_path</i>
             When using the SFTP protocol support via <b>-M</b>, connect
             directly to a local SFTP server program rather than a
             remote one via ssh(1).  This option may be useful in
             debugging the client and server.

     <b>-F </b><i>ssh_config</i>
             Specifies an alternative per-user configuration file for
             <b>ssh</b>.  This option is directly passed to ssh(1).

     <b>-i </b><i>identity_file</i>
             Selects the file from which the identity (private key) for
             public key authentication is read.  This option is directly
             passed to ssh(1).

     <b>-J </b><i>destination</i>
             Connect to the target host by first making an <b>scp</b>
             connection to the jump host described by <i>destination</i> and
             then establishing a TCP forwarding to the ultimate
             destination from there.  Multiple jump hops may be
             specified separated by comma characters.  This is a
             shortcut to specify a <b>ProxyJump </b>configuration directive.
             This option is directly passed to ssh(1).

     <b>-l </b><i>limit</i>
             Limits the used bandwidth, specified in Kbit/s.

     <b>-O      </b>Use the legacy SCP protocol for file transfers instead of
             the SFTP protocol.  Forcing the use of the SCP protocol may
             be necessary for servers that do not implement SFTP or for
             backwards-compatibility for particular filename wildcard
             patterns.  This mode is the default.

     <b>-o </b><i>ssh_option</i>
             Can be used to pass options to <b>ssh </b>in the format used in
             ssh_config(5).  This is useful for specifying options for
             which there is no separate <b>scp </b>command-line flag.  For full
             details of the options listed below, and their possible
             values, see ssh_config(5).

     <b>-P </b><i>port</i>
             Specifies the port to connect to on the remote host.  Note
             that this option is written with a capital ‘P’, because <b>-p</b>
             is already reserved for preserving the times and modes of
             the file.

     <b>-p      </b>Preserves modification times, access times, and modes from
             the original file.

     <b>-q      </b>Quiet mode: disables the progress meter as well as warning
             and diagnostic messages from ssh(1).

     <b>-R      </b>Copies between two remote hosts are performed by connecting
             to the origin host and executing <b>scp </b>there.  This requires
             that <b>scp </b>running on the origin host can authenticate to the
             destination host without requiring a password.

     <b>-r      </b>Recursively copy entire directories.  Note that <b>scp </b>follows
             symbolic links encountered in the tree traversal.

     <b>-S </b><i>program</i>
             Name of <i>program</i> to use for the encrypted connection.  The
             program must understand ssh(1) options.

     <b>-s      </b>Use the SFTP protocol for file transfers instead of the
             legacy SCP protocol.  Using SFTP avoids invoking a shell on
             the remote side and provides more predictable filename
             handling, as the SCP protocol relied on the remote shell
             for expanding glob(3) wildcards.

             A near-future release of OpenSSH will make the SFTP
             protocol the default.  This option will be deleted before
             the end of 2022.

     <b>-T      </b>Disable strict filename checking.  By default when copying
             files from a remote host to a local directory <b>scp </b>checks
             that the received filenames match those requested on the
             command-line to prevent the remote end from sending
             unexpected or unwanted files.  Because of differences in
             how various operating systems and shells interpret filename
             wildcards, these checks may cause wanted files to be
             rejected.  This option disables these checks at the expense
             of fully trusting that the server will not send unexpected
             filenames.

     <b>-v      </b>Verbose mode.  Causes <b>scp </b>and ssh(1) to print debugging
             messages about their progress.  This is helpful in
             debugging connection, authentication, and configuration
             problems.
