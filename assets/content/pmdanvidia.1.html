       <b>pmdanvidia </b>is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
       extracts performance metrics describing the metrics available on
       NVIDIA GPU cards via the NVML library.

       The <b>nvidia </b>PMDA exports metrics that measure gpu activity, memory
       utilization, fan speed, etc on NVIDIA Tesla and Quadro cards.
       Metrics are unlikely to be available for consumer class cards.

       A brief description of the <b>pmdanvidia </b>command line options
       follows:

       <b>-d   </b>It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics <i>domain</i>
            number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is,
            <i>domain</i> should be different for every PMDA on the one host,
            and the same <i>domain</i> number should be used for the same PMDA
            on all hosts.

       <b>-l   </b>Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
            <i>nvidia.log</i> is written in the current directory of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a>
            when <b>pmdanvidia </b>is started, i.e.  <b>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd</b>.  If the
            log file cannot be created or is not writable, output is
            written to the standard error instead.
