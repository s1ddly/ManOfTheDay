       <b>dh_installexamples </b>is a debhelper program that is responsible for
       installing examples into <i>usr/share/doc/package/examples</i> in
       package build directories.

       From debhelper compatibility level 11 on, <b>dh_install </b>will fall
       back to looking in <i>debian/tmp</i> for files, if it does not find them
       in the current directory (or wherever you've told it to look
       using <b>--sourcedir</b>).
