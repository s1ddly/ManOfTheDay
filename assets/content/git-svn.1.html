       <i>git svn</i> is a simple conduit for changesets between Subversion and
       Git. It provides a bidirectional flow of changes between a
       Subversion and a Git repository.

       <i>git svn</i> can track a standard Subversion repository, following the
       common "trunk/branches/tags" layout, with the --stdlayout option.
       It can also follow branches and tags in any layout with the
       -T/-t/-b options (see options to <i>init</i> below, and also the <i>clone</i>
       command).

       Once tracking a Subversion repository (with any of the above
       methods), the Git repository can be updated from Subversion by
       the <i>fetch</i> command and Subversion updated from Git by the <i>dcommit</i>
       command.
