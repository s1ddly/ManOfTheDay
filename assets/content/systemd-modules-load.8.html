       systemd-modules-load.service is an early boot service that loads
       kernel modules. It reads static configuration from files in /usr/
       and /etc/, but also runtime configuration from /run/ and the
       kernel command line (see below).

       See <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/modules-load.d.5.html">modules-load.d(5)</a> for information about the configuration
       format of this service and paths where configuration files can be
       created.
