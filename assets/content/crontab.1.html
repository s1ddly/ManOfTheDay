       <i>Crontab</i> is the program used to install a crontab table <i>file</i>,
       remove or list the existing tables used to serve the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/cron.8.html">cron(8)</a>
       daemon.  Each user can have their own crontab, and though these
       are files in <i>/var/spool/</i>, they are not intended to be edited
       directly.  For SELinux in MLS mode, you can define more crontabs
       for each range.  For more information, see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/selinux.8.html">selinux(8)</a>.

       In this version of <i>Cron</i> it is possible to use a network-mounted
       shared <i>/var/spool/cron</i> across a cluster of hosts and specify that
       only one of the hosts should run the crontab jobs in the
       particular directory at any one time.  You may also use <b>crontab</b>
       from any of these hosts to edit the same shared set of crontab
       files, and to set and query which host should run the crontab
       jobs.

       Scheduling cron jobs with <b>crontab </b>can be allowed or disallowed
       for different users.  For this purpose, use the <i>cron.allow</i> and
       <i>cron.deny</i> files.  If the <i>cron.allow</i> file exists, a user must be
       listed in it to be allowed to use <b>crontab</b>.  If the <i>cron.allow</i>
       file does not exist but the <i>cron.deny</i> file does exist, then a
       user must <i>not</i> be listed in the <i>cron.deny</i> file in order to use
       <b>crontab.  </b>If neither of these files exist, then only the super
       user is allowed to use <b>crontab</b>.

       Another way to restrict the scheduling of cron jobs beyond
       <b>crontab </b>is to use PAM authentication in <i>/etc/security/access.conf</i>
       to set up users, which are allowed or disallowed to use <b>crontab</b>
       or modify system cron jobs in the <i>/etc/cron.d/</i> directory.

       The temporary directory can be set in an environment variable.
       If it is not set by the user, the <i>/tmp</i> directory is used.

       When listing a crontab on a terminal the output will be colorized
       unless an environment variable <i>NO_COLOR</i> is set.
