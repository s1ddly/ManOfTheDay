       This document attempts to write down and motivate some of the
       workflow elements used for <b>git.git </b>itself. Many ideas apply in
       general, though the full workflow is rarely required for smaller
       projects with fewer people involved.

       We formulate a set of <i>rules</i> for quick reference, while the prose
       tries to motivate each of them. Do not always take them
       literally; you should value good reasons for your actions higher
       than manpages such as this one.
