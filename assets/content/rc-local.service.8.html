       <b>systemd-rc-local-generator </b>is a generator that checks whether
       /etc/rc.local exists and is executable, and if it is, pulls the
       rc-local.service unit into the boot process. This unit is
       responsible for running this script during late boot. The script
       is run after network.target, but in parallel with most other
       regular system services.

       Note that rc-local.service runs with slightly different semantics
       than the original System V version, which was executed "last" in
       the boot process, which is a concept that does not translate to
       systemd.

       Also note that rc-local.service is ordered after network.target,
       which does not mean that the network is functional, see
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/systemd.special.7.html">systemd.special(7)</a>. If the script requires a configured network
       connection, it may be desirable to pull in and order it after
       network-online.target with a drop-in:

           # /etc/systemd/system/rc-local.service.d/network.conf
           [Unit]
           Wants=network-online.target
           After=network-online.target

       Support for /etc/rc.local is provided for compatibility with
       specific System V systems only. However, it is strongly
       recommended to avoid making use of this script today, and instead
       provide proper unit files with appropriate dependencies for any
       scripts to run during the boot process. Note that the path to the
       script is set at compile time and varies between distributions.
