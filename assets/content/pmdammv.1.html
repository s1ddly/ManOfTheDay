       <b>pmdammv </b>is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
       exports application level performance metrics using memory mapped
       files.  It offers an extremely low overhead instrumentation
       facility that is well-suited to long running, mission critical
       applications where it is desirable to have performance metrics
       and availability information permanently enabled.

       The <b>mmv </b>PMDA exports instrumentation that has been added to an
       application using the MMV APIs (refer to <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/mmv_stats_init.3.html">mmv_stats_init(3)</a> and
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/mmv.5.html">mmv(5)</a> for further details).  These APIs can be called from
       several languages, including C, C++, Perl, Python, Java (via the
       separate ``Parfait'' class library) and GoLang (via the separate
       ``Speed'' library).

       A brief description of the <b>pmdammv </b>command line options follows:

       <b>-d   </b>It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics <i>domain</i>
            number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is,
            <i>domain</i> should be different for every PMDA on the one host,
            and the same <i>domain</i> number should be used for the same PMDA
            on all hosts.

       <b>-l   </b>Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
            <i>mmv.log</i> is written in the current directory of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> when
            <b>pmdammv </b>is started, i.e.  <b>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd</b>.  If the log
            file cannot be created or is not writable, output is written
            to the standard error instead.

       <b>-U   </b>User account under which to run the agent.  The default is
            the unprivileged "pcp" account in current versions of PCP,
            but in older versions the superuser account ("root") was
            used by default.
