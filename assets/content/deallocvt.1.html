       The command <b>deallocvt </b>deallocates kernel memory and data
       structures for all unused virtual consoles.  If one or more
       arguments <i>N</i> ...  are given, only the corresponding consoles
       <i>/dev/ttyN</i> are deallocated.

       A virtual console is unused if it is not the foreground console,
       and no process has it open for reading or writing, and no text
       has been selected on its screen.
