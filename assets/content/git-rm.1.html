       Remove files matching pathspec from the index, or from the
       working tree and the index. <b>git rm </b>will not remove a file from
       just your working directory. (There is no option to remove a file
       only from the working tree and yet keep it in the index; use
       <b>/bin/rm </b>if you want to do that.) The files being removed have to
       be identical to the tip of the branch, and no updates to their
       contents can be staged in the index, though that default behavior
       can be overridden with the <b>-f </b>option. When <b>--cached </b>is given, the
       staged content has to match either the tip of the branch or the
       file on disk, allowing the file to be removed from just the
       index. When sparse-checkouts are in use (see
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/git-sparse-checkout.1.html">git-sparse-checkout(1)</a>), <b>git rm </b>will only remove paths within the
       sparse-checkout patterns.
