       For an overview of namespaces, see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/namespaces.7.html">namespaces(7)</a>.

       Cgroup namespaces virtualize the view of a process's cgroups (see
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/cgroups.7.html">cgroups(7)</a>) as seen via <i>/proc/[pid]/cgroup</i> and
       <i>/proc/[pid]/mountinfo</i>.

       Each cgroup namespace has its own set of cgroup root directories.
       These root directories are the base points for the relative
       locations displayed in the corresponding records in the
       <i>/proc/[pid]/cgroup</i> file.  When a process creates a new cgroup
       namespace using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/clone.2.html">clone(2)</a> or <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/unshare.2.html">unshare(2)</a> with the <b>CLONE_NEWCGROUP</b>
       flag, its current cgroups directories become the cgroup root
       directories of the new namespace.  (This applies both for the
       cgroups version 1 hierarchies and the cgroups version 2 unified
       hierarchy.)

       When reading the cgroup memberships of a "target" process from
       <i>/proc/[pid]/cgroup</i>, the pathname shown in the third field of each
       record will be relative to the reading process's root directory
       for the corresponding cgroup hierarchy.  If the cgroup directory
       of the target process lies outside the root directory of the
       reading process's cgroup namespace, then the pathname will show
       <i>../</i> entries for each ancestor level in the cgroup hierarchy.

       The following shell session demonstrates the effect of creating a
       new cgroup namespace.

       First, (as superuser) in a shell in the initial cgroup namespace,
       we create a child cgroup in the <i>freezer</i> hierarchy, and place a
       process in that cgroup that we will use as part of the
       demonstration below:

           # <b>mkdir -p /sys/fs/cgroup/freezer/sub2</b>
           # <b>sleep 10000 &amp;     </b># Create a process that lives for a while
           [1] 20124
           # <b>echo 20124 &gt; /sys/fs/cgroup/freezer/sub2/cgroup.procs</b>

       We then create another child cgroup in the <i>freezer</i> hierarchy and
       put the shell into that cgroup:

           # <b>mkdir -p /sys/fs/cgroup/freezer/sub</b>
           # <b>echo $$                      </b># Show PID of this shell
           30655
           # <b>echo 30655 &gt; /sys/fs/cgroup/freezer/sub/cgroup.procs</b>
           # <b>cat /proc/self/cgroup | grep freezer</b>
           7:freezer:/sub

       Next, we use <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/unshare.1.html">unshare(1)</a> to create a process running a new shell
       in new cgroup and mount namespaces:

           # <b>PS1="sh2# " unshare -Cm bash</b>

       From the new shell started by <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/unshare.1.html">unshare(1)</a>, we then inspect the
       <i>/proc/[pid]/cgroup</i> files of, respectively, the new shell, a
       process that is in the initial cgroup namespace (<i>init</i>, with PID
       1), and the process in the sibling cgroup (<i>sub2</i>):

           sh2# <b>cat /proc/self/cgroup | grep freezer</b>
           7:freezer:/
           sh2# <b>cat /proc/1/cgroup | grep freezer</b>
           7:freezer:/..
           sh2# <b>cat /proc/20124/cgroup | grep freezer</b>
           7:freezer:/../sub2

       From the output of the first command, we see that the freezer
       cgroup membership of the new shell (which is in the same cgroup
       as the initial shell) is shown defined relative to the freezer
       cgroup root directory that was established when the new cgroup
       namespace was created.  (In absolute terms, the new shell is in
       the <i>/sub</i> freezer cgroup, and the root directory of the freezer
       cgroup hierarchy in the new cgroup namespace is also <i>/sub</i>.  Thus,
       the new shell's cgroup membership is displayed as '/'.)

       However, when we look in <i>/proc/self/mountinfo</i> we see the
       following anomaly:

           sh2# <b>cat /proc/self/mountinfo | grep freezer</b>
           155 145 0:32 /.. /sys/fs/cgroup/freezer ...

       The fourth field of this line (<i>/..</i>)  should show the directory in
       the cgroup filesystem which forms the root of this mount.  Since
       by the definition of cgroup namespaces, the process's current
       freezer cgroup directory became its root freezer cgroup
       directory, we should see '/' in this field.  The problem here is
       that we are seeing a mount entry for the cgroup filesystem
       corresponding to the initial cgroup namespace (whose cgroup
       filesystem is indeed rooted at the parent directory of <i>sub</i>).  To
       fix this problem, we must remount the freezer cgroup filesystem
       from the new shell (i.e., perform the mount from a process that
       is in the new cgroup namespace), after which we see the expected
       results:

           sh2# <b>mount --make-rslave /     </b># Don't propagate mount events
                                          # to other namespaces
           sh2# <b>umount /sys/fs/cgroup/freezer</b>
           sh2# <b>mount -t cgroup -o freezer freezer /sys/fs/cgroup/freezer</b>
           sh2# <b>cat /proc/self/mountinfo | grep freezer</b>
           155 145 0:32 / /sys/fs/cgroup/freezer rw,relatime ...
