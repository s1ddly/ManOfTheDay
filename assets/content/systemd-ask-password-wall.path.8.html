       systemd-ask-password-console.service is a system service that
       queries the user for system passwords (such as hard disk
       encryption keys and SSL certificate passphrases) on the console.
       It is intended to be used during boot to ensure proper handling
       of passwords necessary for boot.
       systemd-ask-password-wall.service is a system service that
       informs all logged in users for system passwords via <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/wall.1.html">wall(1)</a>. It
       is intended to be used after boot to ensure that users are
       properly notified.

       See the <b>developer documentation</b><b></b>[1] for more information about the
       system password logic.

       Note that these services invoke <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/systemd-tty-ask-password-agent.1.html">systemd-tty-ask-password-agent(1)</a>
       with either the <b>--watch --console </b>or <b>--watch --wall </b>command line
       parameters.
