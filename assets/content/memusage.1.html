       <b>memusage </b>is a bash script which profiles memory usage of the
       program, <i>program</i>.  It preloads the <b>libmemusage.so </b>library into
       the caller's environment (via the <b>LD_PRELOAD </b>environment
       variable; see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ld.so.8.html">ld.so(8)</a>).  The <b>libmemusage.so </b>library traces
       memory allocation by intercepting calls to <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/malloc.3.html">malloc(3)</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/calloc.3.html">calloc(3)</a>,
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/free.3.html">free(3)</a>, and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/realloc.3.html">realloc(3)</a>; optionally, calls to <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html">mmap(2)</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mremap.2.html">mremap(2)</a>,
       and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/munmap.2.html">munmap(2)</a> can also be intercepted.

       <b>memusage </b>can output the collected data in textual form, or it can
       use <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/memusagestat.1.html">memusagestat(1)</a> (see the <b>-p </b>option,  below) to create a PNG
       file containing graphical representation of the collected data.

   <b>Memory usage summary</b>
       The "Memory usage summary" line output by <b>memusage </b>contains three
       fields:

           <b>heap total</b>
                  Sum of <i>size</i> arguments of all <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/malloc.3.html">malloc(3)</a> calls, products
                  of arguments (<i>nmemb</i>*<i>size</i>) of all <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/calloc.3.html">calloc(3)</a> calls, and
                  sum of <i>length</i> arguments of all <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html">mmap(2)</a> calls.  In the
                  case of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/realloc.3.html">realloc(3)</a> and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mremap.2.html">mremap(2)</a>, if the new size of
                  an allocation is larger than the previous size, the
                  sum of all such differences (new size minus old size)
                  is added.

           <b>heap peak</b>
                  Maximum of all <i>size</i> arguments of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/malloc.3.html">malloc(3)</a>, all
                  products of <i>nmemb</i>*<i>size</i> of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/calloc.3.html">calloc(3)</a>, all <i>size</i>
                  arguments of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/realloc.3.html">realloc(3)</a>, <i>length</i> arguments of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html">mmap(2)</a>,
                  and <i>new_size</i> arguments of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mremap.2.html">mremap(2)</a>.

           <b>stack peak</b>
                  Before the first call to any monitored function, the
                  stack pointer address (base stack pointer) is saved.
                  After each function call, the actual stack pointer
                  address is read and the difference from the base stack
                  pointer computed.  The maximum of these differences is
                  then the stack peak.

       Immediately following this summary line, a table shows the number
       calls, total memory allocated or deallocated, and number of
       failed calls for each intercepted function.  For <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/realloc.3.html">realloc(3)</a> and
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mremap.2.html">mremap(2)</a>, the additional field "nomove" shows reallocations that
       changed the address of a block, and the additional "dec" field
       shows reallocations that decreased the size of the block.  For
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/realloc.3.html">realloc(3)</a>, the additional field "free" shows reallocations that
       caused a block to be freed (i.e., the reallocated size was 0).

       The "realloc/total memory" of the table output by <b>memusage </b>does
       not reflect cases where <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/realloc.3.html">realloc(3)</a> is used to reallocate a block
       of memory to have a smaller size than previously.  This can cause
       sum of all "total memory" cells (excluding "free") to be larger
       than the "free/total memory" cell.

   <b>Histogram for block sizes</b>
       The "Histogram for block sizes" provides a breakdown of memory
       allocations into various bucket sizes.
