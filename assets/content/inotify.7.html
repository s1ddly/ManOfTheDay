<pre>
       The <i>inotify</i> API provides a mechanism for monitoring filesystem
       events.  Inotify can be used to monitor individual files, or to
       monitor directories.  When a directory is monitored, inotify will
       return events for the directory itself, and for files inside the
       directory.

       The following system calls are used with this API:

       *  <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/inotify_init.2.html">inotify_init(2)</a> creates an inotify instance and returns a file
          descriptor referring to the inotify instance.  The more recent
          <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/inotify_init1.2.html">inotify_init1(2)</a> is like <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/inotify_init.2.html">inotify_init(2)</a>, but has a <i>flags</i>
          argument that provides access to some extra functionality.

       *  <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/inotify_add_watch.2.html">inotify_add_watch(2)</a> manipulates the "watch list" associated
          with an inotify instance.  Each item ("watch") in the watch
          list specifies the pathname of a file or directory, along with
          some set of events that the kernel should monitor for the file
          referred to by that pathname.  <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/inotify_add_watch.2.html">inotify_add_watch(2)</a> either
          creates a new watch item, or modifies an existing watch.  Each
          watch has a unique "watch descriptor", an integer returned by
          <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/inotify_add_watch.2.html">inotify_add_watch(2)</a> when the watch is created.

       *  When events occur for monitored files and directories, those
          events are made available to the application as structured
          data that can be read from the inotify file descriptor using
          <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/read.2.html">read(2)</a> (see below).

       *  <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/inotify_rm_watch.2.html">inotify_rm_watch(2)</a> removes an item from an inotify watch
          list.

       *  When all file descriptors referring to an inotify instance
          have been closed (using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/close.2.html">close(2)</a>), the underlying object and
          its resources are freed for reuse by the kernel; all
          associated watches are automatically freed.

       With careful programming, an application can use inotify to
       efficiently monitor and cache the state of a set of filesystem
       objects.  However, robust applications should allow for the fact
       that bugs in the monitoring logic or races of the kind described
       below may leave the cache inconsistent with the filesystem state.
       It is probably wise to do some consistency checking, and rebuild
       the cache when inconsistencies are detected.

   <b>Reading events from an inotify file descriptor</b>
       To determine what events have occurred, an application <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/read.2.html">read(2)</a>s
       from the inotify file descriptor.  If no events have so far
       occurred, then, assuming a blocking file descriptor, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/read.2.html">read(2)</a> will
       block until at least one event occurs (unless interrupted by a
       signal, in which case the call fails with the error <b>EINTR</b>; see
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/signal.7.html">signal(7)</a>).

       Each successful <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/read.2.html">read(2)</a> returns a buffer containing one or more
       of the following structures:

           struct inotify_event {
               int      wd;       /* Watch descriptor */
               uint32_t mask;     /* Mask describing event */
               uint32_t cookie;   /* Unique cookie associating related
                                     events (for rename(2)) */
               uint32_t len;      /* Size of <i>name</i> field */
               char     name[];   /* Optional null-terminated name */
           };

       <i>wd</i> identifies the watch for which this event occurs.  It is one
       of the watch descriptors returned by a previous call to
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/inotify_add_watch.2.html">inotify_add_watch(2)</a>.

       <i>mask</i> contains bits that describe the event that occurred (see
       below).

       <i>cookie</i> is a unique integer that connects related events.
       Currently, this is used only for rename events, and allows the
       resulting pair of <b>IN_MOVED_FROM </b>and <b>IN_MOVED_TO </b>events to be
       connected by the application.  For all other event types, <i>cookie</i>
       is set to 0.

       The <i>name</i> field is present only when an event is returned for a
       file inside a watched directory; it identifies the filename
       within the watched directory.  This filename is null-terminated,
       and may include further null bytes ('\0') to align subsequent
       reads to a suitable address boundary.

       The <i>len</i> field counts all of the bytes in <i>name</i>, including the null
       bytes; the length of each <i>inotify_event</i> structure is thus
       <i>sizeof(struct inotify_event)+len</i>.

       The behavior when the buffer given to <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/read.2.html">read(2)</a> is too small to
       return information about the next event depends on the kernel
       version: in kernels before 2.6.21, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/read.2.html">read(2)</a> returns 0; since
       kernel 2.6.21, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/read.2.html">read(2)</a> fails with the error <b>EINVAL</b>.  Specifying a
       buffer of size

           sizeof(struct inotify_event) + NAME_MAX + 1

       will be sufficient to read at least one event.

   <b>inotify events</b>
       The <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/inotify_add_watch.2.html">inotify_add_watch(2)</a> <i>mask</i> argument and the <i>mask</i> field of the
       <i>inotify_event</i> structure returned when <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/read.2.html">read(2)</a>ing an inotify file
       descriptor are both bit masks identifying inotify events.  The
       following bits can be specified in <i>mask</i> when calling
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/inotify_add_watch.2.html">inotify_add_watch(2)</a> and may be returned in the <i>mask</i> field
       returned by <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/read.2.html">read(2)</a>:

           <b>IN_ACCESS </b>(+)
                  File was accessed (e.g., <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/read.2.html">read(2)</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>).

           <b>IN_ATTRIB </b>(*)
                  Metadata changedâ€”for example, permissions (e.g.,
                  <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/chmod.2.html">chmod(2)</a>), timestamps (e.g., <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/utimensat.2.html">utimensat(2)</a>), extended
                  attributes (<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setxattr.2.html">setxattr(2)</a>), link count (since Linux
                  2.6.25; e.g., for the target of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/link.2.html">link(2)</a> and for
                  <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/unlink.2.html">unlink(2)</a>), and user/group ID (e.g., <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/chown.2.html">chown(2)</a>).

           <b>IN_CLOSE_WRITE </b>(+)
                  File opened for writing was closed.

           <b>IN_CLOSE_NOWRITE </b>(*)
                  File or directory not opened for writing was closed.

           <b>IN_CREATE </b>(+)
                  File/directory created in watched directory (e.g.,
                  <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/open.2.html">open(2)</a> <b>O_CREAT</b>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mkdir.2.html">mkdir(2)</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/link.2.html">link(2)</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/symlink.2.html">symlink(2)</a>,
                  <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/bind.2.html">bind(2)</a> on a UNIX domain socket).

           <b>IN_DELETE </b>(+)
                  File/directory deleted from watched directory.

           <b>IN_DELETE_SELF</b>
                  Watched file/directory was itself deleted.  (This
                  event also occurs if an object is moved to another
                  filesystem, since <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/mv.1.html">mv(1)</a> in effect copies the file to
                  the other filesystem and then deletes it from the
                  original filesystem.)  In addition, an <b>IN_IGNORED</b>
                  event will subsequently be generated for the watch
                  descriptor.

           <b>IN_MODIFY </b>(+)
                  File was modified (e.g., <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/write.2.html">write(2)</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/truncate.2.html">truncate(2)</a>).

           <b>IN_MOVE_SELF</b>
                  Watched file/directory was itself moved.

           <b>IN_MOVED_FROM </b>(+)
                  Generated for the directory containing the old
                  filename when a file is renamed.

           <b>IN_MOVED_TO </b>(+)
                  Generated for the directory containing the new
                  filename when a file is renamed.

           <b>IN_OPEN </b>(*)
                  File or directory was opened.

       Inotify monitoring is inode-based: when monitoring a file (but
       not when monitoring the directory containing a file), an event
       can be generated for activity on any link to the file (in the
       same or a different directory).

       When monitoring a directory:

       *  the events marked above with an asterisk (*) can occur both
          for the directory itself and for objects inside the directory;
          and

       *  the events marked with a plus sign (+) occur only for objects
          inside the directory (not for the directory itself).

       <i>Note</i>: when monitoring a directory, events are not generated for
       the files inside the directory when the events are performed via
       a pathname (i.e., a link) that lies outside the monitored
       directory.

       When events are generated for objects inside a watched directory,
       the <i>name</i> field in the returned <i>inotify_event</i> structure identifies
       the name of the file within the directory.

       The <b>IN_ALL_EVENTS </b>macro is defined as a bit mask of all of the
       above events.  This macro can be used as the <i>mask</i> argument when
       calling <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/inotify_add_watch.2.html">inotify_add_watch(2)</a>.

       Two additional convenience macros are defined:

           <b>IN_MOVE</b>
                  Equates to <b>IN_MOVED_FROM | IN_MOVED_TO</b>.

           <b>IN_CLOSE</b>
                  Equates to <b>IN_CLOSE_WRITE | IN_CLOSE_NOWRITE</b>.

       The following further bits can be specified in <i>mask</i> when calling
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/inotify_add_watch.2.html">inotify_add_watch(2)</a>:

           <b>IN_DONT_FOLLOW </b>(since Linux 2.6.15)
                  Don't dereference <i>pathname</i> if it is a symbolic link.

           <b>IN_EXCL_UNLINK </b>(since Linux 2.6.36)
                  By default, when watching events on the children of a
                  directory, events are generated for children even
                  after they have been unlinked from the directory.
                  This can result in large numbers of uninteresting
                  events for some applications (e.g., if watching <i>/tmp</i>,
                  in which many applications create temporary files
                  whose names are immediately unlinked).  Specifying
                  <b>IN_EXCL_UNLINK </b>changes the default behavior, so that
                  events are not generated for children after they have
                  been unlinked from the watched directory.

           <b>IN_MASK_ADD</b>
                  If a watch instance already exists for the filesystem
                  object corresponding to <i>pathname</i>, add (OR) the events
                  in <i>mask</i> to the watch mask (instead of replacing the
                  mask); the error <b>EINVAL </b>results if <b>IN_MASK_CREATE </b>is
                  also specified.

           <b>IN_ONESHOT</b>
                  Monitor the filesystem object corresponding to
                  <i>pathname</i> for one event, then remove from watch list.

           <b>IN_ONLYDIR </b>(since Linux 2.6.15)
                  Watch <i>pathname</i> only if it is a directory; the error
                  <b>ENOTDIR </b>results if <i>pathname</i> is not a directory.  Using
                  this flag provides an application with a race-free way
                  of ensuring that the monitored object is a directory.

           <b>IN_MASK_CREATE </b>(since Linux 4.18)
                  Watch <i>pathname</i> only if it does not already have a
                  watch associated with it; the error <b>EEXIST </b>results if
                  <i>pathname</i> is already being watched.

                  Using this flag provides an application with a way of
                  ensuring that new watches do not modify existing ones.
                  This is useful because multiple paths may refer to the
                  same inode, and multiple calls to <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/inotify_add_watch.2.html">inotify_add_watch(2)</a>
                  without this flag may clobber existing watch masks.

       The following bits may be set in the <i>mask</i> field returned by
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/read.2.html">read(2)</a>:

           <b>IN_IGNORED</b>
                  Watch was removed explicitly (<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/inotify_rm_watch.2.html">inotify_rm_watch(2)</a>) or
                  automatically (file was deleted, or filesystem was
                  unmounted).  See also BUGS.

           <b>IN_ISDIR</b>
                  Subject of this event is a directory.

           <b>IN_Q_OVERFLOW</b>
                  Event queue overflowed (<i>wd</i> is -1 for this event).

           <b>IN_UNMOUNT</b>
                  Filesystem containing watched object was unmounted.
                  In addition, an <b>IN_IGNORED </b>event will subsequently be
                  generated for the watch descriptor.

   <b>Examples</b>
       Suppose an application is watching the directory <i>dir</i> and the file
       <i>dir/myfile</i> for all events.  The examples below show some events
       that will be generated for these two objects.

           fd = open("dir/myfile", O_RDWR);
                  Generates <b>IN_OPEN </b>events for both <i>dir</i> and <i>dir/myfile</i>.

           read(fd, buf, count);
                  Generates <b>IN_ACCESS </b>events for both <i>dir</i> and
                  <i>dir/myfile</i>.

           write(fd, buf, count);
                  Generates <b>IN_MODIFY </b>events for both <i>dir</i> and
                  <i>dir/myfile</i>.

           fchmod(fd, mode);
                  Generates <b>IN_ATTRIB </b>events for both <i>dir</i> and
                  <i>dir/myfile</i>.

           close(fd);
                  Generates <b>IN_CLOSE_WRITE </b>events for both <i>dir</i> and
                  <i>dir/myfile</i>.

       Suppose an application is watching the directories <i>dir1</i> and <i>dir2</i>,
       and the file <i>dir1/myfile</i>.  The following examples show some
       events that may be generated.

           link("dir1/myfile", "dir2/new");
                  Generates an <b>IN_ATTRIB </b>event for <i>myfile</i> and an
                  <b>IN_CREATE </b>event for <i>dir2</i>.

           rename("dir1/myfile", "dir2/myfile");
                  Generates an <b>IN_MOVED_FROM </b>event for <i>dir1</i>, an
                  <b>IN_MOVED_TO </b>event for <i>dir2</i>, and an <b>IN_MOVE_SELF </b>event
                  for <i>myfile</i>.  The <b>IN_MOVED_FROM </b>and <b>IN_MOVED_TO </b>events
                  will have the same <i>cookie</i> value.

       Suppose that <i>dir1/xx</i> and <i>dir2/yy</i> are (the only) links to the same
       file, and an application is watching <i>dir1</i>, <i>dir2</i>, <i>dir1/xx</i>, and
       <i>dir2/yy</i>.  Executing the following calls in the order given below
       will generate the following events:

           unlink("dir2/yy");
                  Generates an <b>IN_ATTRIB </b>event for <i>xx</i> (because its link
                  count changes) and an <b>IN_DELETE </b>event for <i>dir2</i>.

           unlink("dir1/xx");
                  Generates <b>IN_ATTRIB</b>, <b>IN_DELETE_SELF</b>, and <b>IN_IGNORED</b>
                  events for <i>xx</i>, and an <b>IN_DELETE </b>event for <i>dir1</i>.

       Suppose an application is watching the directory <i>dir</i> and (the
       empty) directory <i>dir/subdir</i>.  The following examples show some
       events that may be generated.

           mkdir("dir/new", mode);
                  Generates an <b>IN_CREATE | IN_ISDIR </b>event for <i>dir</i>.

           rmdir("dir/subdir");
                  Generates <b>IN_DELETE_SELF </b>and <b>IN_IGNORED </b>events for
                  <i>subdir</i>, and an <b>IN_DELETE | IN_ISDIR </b>event for <i>dir</i>.

   <b>/proc interfaces</b>
       The following interfaces can be used to limit the amount of
       kernel memory consumed by inotify:

       <i>/proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_queued_events</i>
              The value in this file is used when an application calls
              <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/inotify_init.2.html">inotify_init(2)</a> to set an upper limit on the number of
              events that can be queued to the corresponding inotify
              instance.  Events in excess of this limit are dropped, but
              an <b>IN_Q_OVERFLOW </b>event is always generated.

       <i>/proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_instances</i>
              This specifies an upper limit on the number of inotify
              instances that can be created per real user ID.

       <i>/proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches</i>
              This specifies an upper limit on the number of watches
              that can be created per real user ID.
