       This manual page is an introduction to the Babeltrace 2 project.

       The “WHAT IS BABELTRACE 2?” section describes the parts of the
       project and shows the major changes from Babeltrace 1 to
       Babeltrace 2 while the “BABELTRACE 2 CONCEPTS” section defines
       the core concepts of Babeltrace 2.

       The “TRACE PROCESSING GRAPH REPRESENTATION” section shows how
       some concepts are visually represented in other Babeltrace 2
       manual pages.
