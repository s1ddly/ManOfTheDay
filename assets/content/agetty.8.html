       <b>agetty </b>opens a tty port, prompts for a login name and invokes the
       /bin/login command. It is normally invoked by <b>init</b>(8).

       <b>agetty </b>has several <i>non-standard</i> features that are useful for
       hardwired and for dial-in lines:

       •   Adapts the tty settings to parity bits and to erase, kill,
           end-of-line and uppercase characters when it reads a login
           name. The program can handle 7-bit characters with even, odd,
           none or space parity, and 8-bit characters with no parity.
           The following special characters are recognized: Control-U
           (kill); DEL and backspace (erase); carriage return and line
           feed (end of line). See also the <b>--erase-chars </b>and
           <b>--kill-chars </b>options.

       •   Optionally deduces the baud rate from the CONNECT messages
           produced by Hayes(tm)-compatible modems.

       •   Optionally does not hang up when it is given an already
           opened line (useful for call-back applications).

       •   Optionally does not display the contents of the <i>/etc/issue</i>
           file.

       •   Optionally displays an alternative issue files or directories
           instead of <i>/etc/issue</i> or <i>/etc/issue.d</i>.

       •   Optionally does not ask for a login name.

       •   Optionally invokes a non-standard login program instead of
           <i>/bin/login</i>.

       •   Optionally turns on hardware flow control.

       •   Optionally forces the line to be local with no need for
           carrier detect.

       This program does not use the <i>/etc/gettydefs</i> (System V) or
       <i>/etc/gettytab</i> (SunOS 4) files.
