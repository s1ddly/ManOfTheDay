<pre>
       The <b>lttng disable-event </b>command disables one or more event rules
       previously enabled by the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/lttng-enable-event.1.html">lttng-enable-event(1)</a> command.

       Event rules are always assigned to a channel when they are
       created. If the <b>--channel </b>option is omitted, the default channel
       named <b>channel0 </b>is used.

       If the <b>--session </b>option is omitted, the chosen channel is picked
       from the current tracing session.

       If the <b>--all-events </b>option is used, all the existing event rules
       of the chosen domain are disabled. Otherwise, at least one event
       rule to disable named <i>EVENT</i> must be specified.

       With the <b>--kernel </b>option, the event source type can be specified
       using one of the <b>--tracepoint</b>, <b>--probe</b>, <b>--function</b>, or <b>--syscall</b>
       options. See <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/lttng-enable-event.1.html">lttng-enable-event(1)</a> for more details about event
       source types.

       Events can be disabled while tracing is active (use
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/lttng-start.1.html">lttng-start(1)</a> to make a tracing session active).
