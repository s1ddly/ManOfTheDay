       <b>minizip </b>is a simple tool which allows the extraction of
       compressed file archives in the ZIP format used by the MS-DOS
       utility PKZIP.  It was written as a demonstration of the <b>zlib</b>(3)
       library and therefore lack many of the features of the <b>unzip</b>(1)
       program.
