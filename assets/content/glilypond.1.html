       <i>glilypond</i> transforms sheet music written in the <i>lilypond</i> language
       into the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/groff.7.html">groff(7)</a> language using the <b>.PSPIC </b>request, such that
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/groff.1.html">groff(1)</a> can transform it into a format that can be displayed
       directly.  <b>.PDFPIC </b>is available, but does on yet work with
       lilypond.

       If no operands are given, or if <i>file</i> is “<b>-</b>”, <i>glilypond</i> reads the
       standard input stream.  A double-dash argument (“<b>--</b>”) causes all
       subsequent arguments to be interpreted as <i>file</i> operands, even if
       their names start with a dash.
