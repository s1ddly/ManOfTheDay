       <b>rpc.rquotad </b>is an <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/rpc.3.html">rpc(3)</a> server which returns quotas for a user
       of a local filesystem which is mounted by a remote machine over
       the NFS.  It also allows setting of quotas on NFS mounted
       filesystem (if configured during compilation and allowed by a
       command line option <b>-S</b>).  The results are used by <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/quota.1.html">quota(1)</a> to
       display user quotas for remote filesystems and by <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/edquota.8.html">edquota(8)</a> to
       set quotas on remote filesystems.  <b>rquotad </b>daemon uses tcp-
       wrappers library (under service name <i>rquotad</i>) which allows you to
       specify hosts allowed/disallowed to use the daemon (see
       <b>hosts.allow</b>(5) manpage for more information). The <b>rquotad </b>daemon
       is normally started at boot time from the system startup scripts.
