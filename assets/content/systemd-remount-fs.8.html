       systemd-remount-fs.service is an early boot service that applies
       mount options listed in <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/fstab.5.html">fstab(5)</a>, or gathered from the partition
       table (when <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/systemd-gpt-auto-generator.8.html">systemd-gpt-auto-generator(8)</a> is active) to the root
       file system, the /usr/ file system, and the kernel API file
       systems. This is required so that the mount options of these file
       systems — which are pre-mounted by the kernel, the initial RAM
       disk, container environments or system manager code — are updated
       to those configured in /etc/fstab and the other sources. This
       service ignores normal file systems and only changes the root
       file system (i.e.  /), /usr/, and the virtual kernel API file
       systems such as /proc/, /sys/ or /dev/. This service executes no
       operation if no configuration is found (/etc/fstab does not exist
       or lists no entries for the mentioned file systems, or the
       partition table does not contain relevant entries).

       For a longer discussion of kernel API file systems see <b>API File</b>
       <b>Systems</b><b></b>[1].

       Note: systemd-remount-fs.service is usually pulled in by
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/systemd-fstab-generator.8.html">systemd-fstab-generator(8)</a>, hence it is also affected by the
       kernel command line option <i>fstab=</i>, which may be used to disable
       the generator. It may also pulled in by
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/systemd-gpt-auto-generator.8.html">systemd-gpt-auto-generator(8)</a>, which is affected by
       <i>systemd.gpt_auto</i> and other options.
