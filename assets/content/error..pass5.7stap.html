       Errors that occur during pass 5 (execution) can have a variety of
       causes.

       exceptional events during script execution
              The systemtap translator and runtime include numerous
              error checks that aim to protect the systems and the users
              from mistakes or transient conditions.  The script may
              deliberately call the <i>error()</i> tapset function to signal a
              problem.  Some memory needed for accessing <i>$context</i>
              variables may be temporarily unavailable.  Consider using
              the <i>try</i>/<i>catch</i> construct to wrap script fragments in
              exception-handling code.  Consider using the <i>stap</i>
              <i>--suppress-handler-errors</i> or <i>stap --skip-badvars</i> option.

       resource exhaustion
              One of several types of space or time resource limits may
              be exceeded by the script, including system overload, too
              many tuples to be stored in an array, etc.  Some of the
              error messages identify the constraint by macro name,
              which may be individually raised.  Consider using the <i>stap</i>
              <i>--suppress-handler-errors</i> and/or <i>stap -g --suppress-time-</i>
              <i>limits</i> options.  Extend or disable individual resource
              limits using the <i>stap -DSOME_LIMIT=NNNN</i> option.  The <i>stap</i>
              <i>-t</i> option may identify those probes that are taking too
              long.

       remote execution server problems
              If you use the <i>stap --remote</i> option to direct a systemtap
              script to be executed somewhere else, ensure that an SSH
              connection may be made to the remote host, and that it has
              the current systemtap runtime installed &amp; available.

       installation/permission problems
              It is possible that your copy of systemtap was not
              correctly installed.  For example, the <i>/usr/bin/staprun</i>
              program may lack the necessary setuid permissions, or your
              invoking userid might not have sufficient privileges
              (root, or <i>stapusr</i> and related group memberships).
              Environment variables may interfere with locating
              <i>/usr/libexec/.../stapio</i>.

       security configuration
              SecureBoot or other module signing machinery may be in
              effect, preventing <b>.ko </b>module loading.  A local or remote
              <i>stap-server</i> service would be necessary to securely manage
              keys.  This situation is detected automatically on most
              kernels, but on some, the <i>SYSTEMTAP_SIGN</i> environment
              varible may have to be set to trigger this extra signing-
              related processing.

              The normal kernel-module based systemtap backend may be
              more than your script requires.  Try <i>stap --runtime=bpf</i>
              and/or <i>stap --runtime=dyninst</i> backends.  Though they have
              inherent limitations, they operate with lesser privileges
              and perceived risks.

              It may be possible to disable secure/lockdown measures
              temporarily with the SysRQ+x keystroke, or permanently
              with <i>sudo mokutil --disable-validation</i> and a reboot.

       errors from target program
              The program invoked by the <i>stap -c CMD</i> option may exit
              with a non-zero code.

       uncaught exceptions in the target program
              When using <i>--runtime=dyninst</i> you may encounter an issue
              where the target program aborts with a message like
              "terminate called after throwing an instance of
              'foo_exception'".  This is unfortunately a limitation of
              Dyninst, which sometimes prevents exceptions from properly
              unwinding through instrumented code.
