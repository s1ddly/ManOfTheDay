       Firejail is a SUID sandbox program that reduces the risk of
       security breaches by restricting the running environment of
       untrusted applications using Linux namespaces, seccomp-bpf and
       Linux capabilities.  It allows a process and all its descendants
       to have their own private view of the globally shared kernel
       resources, such as the network stack, process table, mount table.
       Firejail can work in a SELinux or AppArmor environment, and it is
       integrated with Linux Control Groups.

       Written in C with virtually no dependencies, the software runs on
       any Linux computer with a 3.x kernel version or newer.  It can
       sandbox any type of processes: servers, graphical applications,
       and even user login sessions.

       Firejail allows the user to manage application security using
       security profiles.  Each profile defines a set of permissions for
       a specific application or group of applications. The software
       includes security profiles for a number of more common Linux
       programs, such as Mozilla Firefox, Chromium, VLC, Transmission
       etc.

       Alternative sandbox technologies like snap
       (<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pagestps://snapcraft.io/">https://snapcraft.io/</a>) and flatpak (<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pagestps://flatpak.org/">https://flatpak.org/</a>) are
       not supported. Snap and flatpak packages have their own native
       management tools and will not work when sandboxed with Firejail.
