<pre>
       Switch to a specified branch. The working tree and the index are
       updated to match the branch. All new commits will be added to the
       tip of this branch.

       Optionally a new branch could be created with either <b>-c</b>, <b>-C</b>,
       automatically from a remote branch of same name (see <b>--guess</b>), or
       detach the working tree from any branch with <b>--detach</b>, along with
       switching.

       Switching branches does not require a clean index and working
       tree (i.e. no differences compared to <b>HEAD</b>). The operation is
       aborted however if the operation leads to loss of local changes,
       unless told otherwise with <b>--discard-changes </b>or <b>--merge</b>.

       THIS COMMAND IS EXPERIMENTAL. THE BEHAVIOR MAY CHANGE.
