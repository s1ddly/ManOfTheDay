       This command updates the index using the current content found in
       the working tree, to prepare the content staged for the next
       commit. It typically adds the current content of existing paths
       as a whole, but with some options it can also be used to add
       content with only part of the changes made to the working tree
       files applied, or remove paths that do not exist in the working
       tree anymore.

       The "index" holds a snapshot of the content of the working tree,
       and it is this snapshot that is taken as the contents of the next
       commit. Thus after making any changes to the working tree, and
       before running the commit command, you must use the <b>add </b>command
       to add any new or modified files to the index.

       This command can be performed multiple times before a commit. It
       only adds the content of the specified file(s) at the time the
       add command is run; if you want subsequent changes included in
       the next commit, then you must run <b>git add </b>again to add the new
       content to the index.

       The <b>git status </b>command can be used to obtain a summary of which
       files have changes that are staged for the next commit.

       The <b>git add </b>command will not add ignored files by default. If any
       ignored files were explicitly specified on the command line, <b>git</b>
       <b>add </b>will fail with a list of ignored files. Ignored files reached
       by directory recursion or filename globbing performed by Git
       (quote your globs before the shell) will be silently ignored. The
       <i>git add</i> command can be used to add ignored files with the <b>-f</b>
       (force) option.

       Please see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/git-commit.1.html">git-commit(1)</a> for alternative ways to add content to a
       commit.
