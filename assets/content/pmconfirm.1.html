       <b>pmquery </b>provides a command-line-option compatible implementation
       of the <b>xconfirm </b>and <b>xmessage </b>tools, using a look-and-feel that is
       consistent with <b>pmchart</b>.  Several extensions to the functionality
       of the original tools have been made, in order to improve their
       specific utility for <b>pmchart</b>, but wherever possible the original
       semantics remain.

       <b>pmconfirm </b>displays a line of text for each <b>-t </b>option specified
       (or a file when the <b>-file </b>option is used), and a button for each
       <b>-b </b>option specified.  When one of the buttons is pressed, the
       label of that button is written to <b>pmquery's </b>standard output.
       This provides a means of communication/feedback from within shell
       scripts and a means to display useful information to a user from
       an application.

       <b>pmmessage </b>displays a window containing a message from the command
       line, a file, or standard input.  It additionally allows buttons
       to be associated with an exit status, and only optionally will
       write the label of the button to standard output.

       <b>pmquery </b>extends the above tools to additionally support limited
       user input, as free form text.  In this <b>-input </b>mode, any text
       entered will be output when the default button is pressed.  A
       default text can be entered using the same mechanisms as the
       other tools.

       Command line options are available to specify font style, frame
       style, modality and one of several different icons to be
       presented for tailored visual feedback to the user.
