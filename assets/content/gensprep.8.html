       <b>gensprep </b>reads filtered RFC 3454 files and compiles their
       information into a binary form.  The resulting file, <b>&lt;name&gt;.icu</b>,
       can then be read directly by ICU, or used by <b>pkgdata</b>(8) for
       incorporation into a larger archive or library.

       The files read by <b>gensprep </b>are described in the <b>FILES </b>section.
