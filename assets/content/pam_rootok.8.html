       pam_rootok is a PAM module that authenticates the user if their
       <i>UID</i> is <i>0</i>. Applications that are created setuid-root generally
       retain the <i>UID</i> of the user but run with the authority of an
       enhanced effective-UID. It is the real <i>UID</i> that is checked.
