       <b>hostnamectl </b>may be used to query and change the system hostname
       and related settings.

       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/systemd-hostnamed.service.8.html">systemd-hostnamed.service(8)</a> and this tool distinguish three
       different hostnames: the high-level "pretty" hostname which might
       include all kinds of special characters (e.g. "Lennart's
       Laptop"), the "static" hostname which is the user-configured
       hostname (e.g. "lennarts-laptop"), and the transient hostname
       which is a fallback value received from network configuration
       (e.g. "node12345678"). If a static hostname is set to a valid
       value, then the transient hostname is not used.

       Note that the pretty hostname has little restrictions on the
       characters and length used, while the static and transient
       hostnames are limited to the usually accepted characters of
       Internet domain names, and 64 characters at maximum (the latter
       being a Linux limitation).

       Use <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/systemd-firstboot.1.html">systemd-firstboot(1)</a> to initialize the system hostname for
       mounted (but not booted) system images.
