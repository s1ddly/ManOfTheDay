       <b>xfs_copy </b>copies an XFS filesystem to one or more targets in
       parallel (see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/xfs.5.html">xfs(5)</a>).  The first (<i>source</i>) argument must be the
       pathname of the device or file containing the XFS filesystem. The
       remaining arguments specify one or more <i>target</i> devices or file
       names. If the pathnames specify devices, a copy of the source XFS
       filesystem is created on each device. The <i>target</i> can also be the
       name of a regular file, in which case an image of the source XFS
       filesystem is created in that file. If the file does not exist,
       <b>xfs_copy </b>creates the file. The length of the resulting file is
       equal to the size of the source filesystem. However, if the file
       is created on an XFS filesystem, the file consumes roughly the
       amount of space actually used in the source filesystem by the
       filesystem and the XFS log.  The space saving is because <b>xfs_copy</b>
       seeks over free blocks instead of copying them and the XFS
       filesystem supports sparse files efficiently.

       <b>xfs_copy </b>should only be used to copy unmounted filesystems, read-
       only mounted filesystems, or frozen filesystems (see
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/xfs_freeze.8.html">xfs_freeze(8)</a>).  Otherwise, the generated filesystem(s) would be
       inconsistent or corrupt.

       <b>xfs_copy </b>does not alter the source filesystem in any way. Each
       new (target) filesystem is identical to the original filesystem
       except that new filesystems each have a new unique filesystem
       identifier (UUID).  Therefore, if both the old and new
       filesystems will be used as separate distinct filesystems,
       <b>xfs_copy </b>or <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/xfsdump.8.html">xfsdump(8)</a>/<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/xfsrestore.8.html">xfsrestore(8)</a> should be used to generate
       the new filesystem(s) instead of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dd.1.html">dd(1)</a> or other programs that do
       block-by-block disk copying.

       <b>xfs_copy </b>uses synchronous writes to ensure that write errors are
       detected.

       <b>xfs_copy </b>uses <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/pthreads.7.html">pthreads(7)</a> to perform simultaneous parallel
       writes.  <b>xfs_copy </b>creates one additional thread for each target
       to be written.  All threads die if <b>xfs_copy </b>terminates or aborts.
