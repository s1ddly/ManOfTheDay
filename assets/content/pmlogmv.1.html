       A Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) archive consists of multiple files
       as created by <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a>.  <b>pmlogmv </b>allows all the files of a
       single PCP archive to be moved or renamed as a group in a single
       operation.

       The <i>oldname</i> argument identifies the target archive, and may be
       either the basename that is common to all files in that archive
       or one of the archive's files.  The new archive's basename is
       <i>newname</i>.

       Because PCP archives are important records of system activity,
       special care is taken to ensure the integrity of an archive's
       files.  For recoverable problems encountered during the execution
       of <b>pmlogmv</b>, all the files associated with <i>oldname</i> will be
       preserved, and no new files with the <i>newname</i> prefix will be
       created.  ``Recoverable problems'' include signals that can be
       caught (such as SIGHUP, SIGINT, SIGQUIT and SIGTERM), permissions
       issues, new files already existing, file system full events, etc.

       The implementation of <b>pmlogmv </b>uses hard links in the file system
       and so follows the semantic restrictions of <b>ln</b>(2) which for most
       systems means the directories containing both the <i>oldname</i> and the
       <i>newname</i> PCP archive files need to be writeable and within the
       <b>same </b>file system.
