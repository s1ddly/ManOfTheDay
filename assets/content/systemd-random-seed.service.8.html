       systemd-random-seed.service is a service that loads an on-disk
       random seed into the kernel entropy pool during boot and saves it
       at shutdown. See <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man4/random.4.html">random(4)</a> for details. By default, no entropy is
       credited when the random seed is written into the kernel entropy
       pool, but this may be changed with <i>$SYSTEMD_RANDOM_SEED_CREDIT</i>,
       see below. On disk the random seed is stored in
       /var/lib/systemd/random-seed.

       Note that this service runs relatively late during the early boot
       phase, i.e. generally after the initial RAM disk (initrd)
       completed its work, and the /var/ file system has been mounted
       writable. Many system services require entropy much earlier than
       this — this service is hence of limited use for complex system.
       It is recommended to use a boot loader that can pass an initial
       random seed to the kernel to ensure that entropy is available
       from earliest boot on, for example <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/systemd-boot.7.html">systemd-boot(7)</a>, with its
       <b>bootctl random-seed </b>functionality.

       When loading the random seed from disk, the file is immediately
       updated with a new seed retrieved from the kernel, in order to
       ensure no two boots operate with the same random seed. This new
       seed is retrieved synchronously from the kernel, which means the
       service will not complete start-up until the random pool is fully
       initialized. On entropy-starved systems this may take a while.
       This functionality is intended to be used as synchronization
       point for ordering services that require an initialized entropy
       pool to function securely (i.e. services that access /dev/urandom
       without any further precautions).

       Care should be taken when creating OS images that are replicated
       to multiple systems: if the random seed file is included
       unmodified each system will initialize its entropy pool with the
       same data, and thus — if otherwise entropy-starved — generate the
       same or at least guessable random seed streams. As a safety
       precaution crediting entropy is thus disabled by default. It is
       recommended to remove the random seed from OS images intended for
       replication on multiple systems, in which case it is safe to
       enable entropy crediting, see below.
