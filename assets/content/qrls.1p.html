       A batch job might have one or more holds, which prevent the batch
       job from executing. A batch job from which all the holds have
       been removed becomes eligible for execution and is said to have
       been released. A batch job hold is removed by sending a request
       to the batch server that manages the batch job. The <i>qrls</i> utility
       is a user-accessible client of batch services that requests holds
       be removed from one or more batch jobs.

       The <i>qrls</i> utility shall remove one or more holds from those batch
       jobs for which a batch <i>job_identifier</i> is presented to the
       utility.

       The <i>qrls</i> utility shall remove holds from batch jobs in the order
       in which their batch <i>job_identifier</i>s are presented to the
       utility.

       If the <i>qrls</i> utility fails to process a batch <i>job_identifier</i>
       successfully, the utility shall proceed to process the remaining
       batch <i>job_identifier</i>s, if any.

       The <i>qrls</i> utility shall remove holds on each batch job by sending
       a <i>Release Job Request</i> to the batch server that manages the batch
       job.

       The <i>qrls</i> utility shall not exit until the holds have been removed
       from the batch job corresponding to each successfully processed
       batch <i>job_identifier</i>.
