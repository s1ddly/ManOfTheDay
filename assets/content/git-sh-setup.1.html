<pre>
       This is not a command the end user would want to run. Ever. This
       documentation is meant for people who are studying the
       Porcelain-ish scripts and/or are writing new ones.

       The <i>git sh-setup</i> scriptlet is designed to be sourced (using <b>.</b>) by
       other shell scripts to set up some variables pointing at the
       normal Git directories and a few helper shell functions.

       Before sourcing it, your script should set up a few variables;
       <b>USAGE </b>(and <b>LONG_USAGE</b>, if any) is used to define message given by
       <b>usage() </b>shell function. <b>SUBDIRECTORY_OK </b>can be set if the script
       can run from a subdirectory of the working tree (some commands do
       not).

       The scriptlet sets <b>GIT_DIR </b>and <b>GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY </b>shell
       variables, but does <b>not </b>export them to the environment.
