<pre>
       Run a new shell in a new context.  The new context is derived
       from the old context in which <b>newrole </b>is originally executed.  If
       the <b>-r </b>or <b>--role </b>option is specified, then the new context will
       have the role specified by <i>ROLE</i>.  If the <b>-t </b>or <b>--type </b>option is
       specified, then the new context will have the type (domain)
       specified by <i>TYPE</i>.  If a role is specified, but no type is
       specified, the default type is derived from the specified role.
       If the <b>-l </b>or <b>--level </b>option is specified, then the new context
       will have the sensitivity level specified by <i>LEVEL</i>.  If <i>LEVEL</i> is
       a range, the new context will have the sensitivity level and
       clearance specified by that range.  If the <b>-p </b>or <b>--preserve-</b>
       <b>environment </b>option is specified, the shell with the new SELinux
       context will preserve environment variables, otherwise a new
       minimal environment is created.

       Additional arguments <i>ARGS</i> may be provided after a -- option, in
       which case they are supplied to the new shell.  In particular, an
       argument of -- -c will cause the next argument to be treated as a
       command by most command interpreters.

       If a command argument is specified to newrole and the command
       name is found in /etc/selinux/newrole_pam.conf, then the pam
       service name listed in that file for the command will be used
       rather than the normal newrole pam configuration.  This allows
       for per-command pam configuration when invoked via newrole, e.g.
       to skip the interactive re-authentication phase.

       The new shell will be the shell specified in the user's entry in
       the <i>/etc/passwd</i> file.

       The <b>-V </b>or <b>--version </b>shows the current version of newrole
