       The <b>rpc.mountd </b>daemon implements the server side of the NFS MOUNT
       protocol, an NFS side protocol used by NFS version 2 [RFC1094]
       and NFS version 3 [RFC1813].  It also responds to requests from
       the Linux kernel to authenticate clients and provides details of
       access permissions.

       The NFS server (<i>nfsd</i>) maintains a cache of authentication and
       authorization information which is used to identify the source of
       each request, and then what access permissions that source has to
       any local filesystem.  When required information is not found in
       the cache, the server sends a request to <b>mountd </b>to fill in the
       missing information.  Mountd uses a table of information stored
       in <b>/var/lib/nfs/etab </b>and maintained by <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/exportfs.8.html">exportfs(8)</a>, possibly
       based on the contents of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/exports.5.html">exports(5)</a>, to respond to each request.

   <b>Mounting exported NFS File Systems</b>
       The NFS MOUNT protocol has several procedures.  The most
       important of these are MNT (mount an export) and UMNT (unmount an
       export).

       A MNT request has two arguments: an explicit argument that
       contains the pathname of the root directory of the export to be
       mounted, and an implicit argument that is the sender's IP
       address.

       When receiving a MNT request from an NFS client, <b>rpc.mountd</b>
       checks both the pathname and the sender's IP address against its
       export table.  If the sender is permitted to access the requested
       export, <b>rpc.mountd </b>returns an NFS file handle for the export's
       root directory to the client.  The client can then use the root
       file handle and NFS LOOKUP requests to navigate the directory
       structure of the export.

   <b>The rmtab File</b>
       The <b>rpc.mountd </b>daemon registers every successful MNT request by
       adding an entry to the <i>/var/lib/nfs/rmtab</i> file.  When receivng a
       UMNT request from an NFS client, <b>rpc.mountd </b>simply removes the
       matching entry from <i>/var/lib/nfs/rmtab</i>, as long as the access
       control list for that export allows that sender to access the
       export.

       Clients can discover the list of file systems an NFS server is
       currently exporting, or the list of other clients that have
       mounted its exports, by using the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/showmount.8.html">showmount(8)</a> command.
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/showmount.8.html">showmount(8)</a> uses other procedures in the NFS MOUNT protocol to
       report information about the server's exported file systems.

       Note, however, that there is little to guarantee that the
       contents of <i>/var/lib/nfs/rmtab</i> are accurate.  A client may
       continue accessing an export even after invoking UMNT.  If the
       client reboots without sending a UMNT request, stale entries
       remain for that client in <i>/var/lib/nfs/rmtab</i>.

   <b>Mounting File Systems with NFSv4</b>
       Version 4 (and later) of NFS does not use a separate NFS MOUNT
       protocol.  Instead mounting is performed using regular NFS
       requests handled by the NFS server in the Linux kernel (<i>nfsd</i>).
       Consequently <i>/var/lib/nfs/rmtab</i> is not updated to reflect any
       NFSv4 activity.
