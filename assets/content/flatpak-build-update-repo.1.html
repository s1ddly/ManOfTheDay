<pre>
       Updates repository metadata for the repository at LOCATION. This
       command generates an OSTree summary file that lists the contents
       of the repository. The summary is used by flatpak remote-ls and
       other commands to display the contents of remote repositories.

       After this command, LOCATION can be used as the repository
       location for flatpak remote-add, either by exporting it over
       http, or directly with a file: url.
