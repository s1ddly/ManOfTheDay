       The <i>dd</i> utility shall copy the specified input file to the
       specified output file with possible conversions using specific
       input and output block sizes. It shall read the input one block
       at a time, using the specified input block size; it shall then
       process the block of data actually returned, which could be
       smaller than the requested block size. It shall apply any
       conversions that have been specified and write the resulting data
       to the output in blocks of the specified output block size. If
       the <b>bs</b>=<i>expr</i> operand is specified and no conversions other than
       <b>sync</b>, <b>noerror</b>, or <b>notrunc </b>are requested, the data returned from
       each input block shall be written as a separate output block; if
       the read returns less than a full block and the <b>sync </b>conversion
       is not specified, the resulting output block shall be the same
       size as the input block. If the <b>bs</b>=<i>expr</i> operand is not specified,
       or a conversion other than <b>sync</b>, <b>noerror</b>, or <b>notrunc </b>is
       requested, the input shall be processed and collected into full-
       sized output blocks until the end of the input is reached.

       The processing order shall be as follows:

        1. An input block is read.

        2. If the input block is shorter than the specified input block
           size and the <b>sync </b>conversion is specified, null bytes shall
           be appended to the input data up to the specified size. (If
           either <b>block </b>or <b>unblock </b>is also specified, &lt;space&gt; characters
           shall be appended instead of null bytes.) The remaining
           conversions and output shall include the pad characters as if
           they had been read from the input.

        3. If the <b>bs</b>=<i>expr</i> operand is specified and no conversion other
           than <b>sync </b>or <b>noerror </b>is requested, the resulting data shall
           be written to the output as a single block, and the remaining
           steps are omitted.

        4. If the <b>swab </b>conversion is specified, each pair of input data
           bytes shall be swapped. If there is an odd number of bytes in
           the input block, the last byte in the input record shall not
           be swapped.

        5. Any remaining conversions (<b>block</b>, <b>unblock</b>, <b>lcase</b>, and <b>ucase</b>)
           shall be performed. These conversions shall operate on the
           input data independently of the input blocking; an input or
           output fixed-length record may span block boundaries.

        6. The data resulting from input or conversion or both shall be
           aggregated into output blocks of the specified size. After
           the end of input is reached, any remaining output shall be
           written as a block without padding if <b>conv</b>=<b>sync </b>is not
           specified; thus, the final output block may be shorter than
           the output block size.
