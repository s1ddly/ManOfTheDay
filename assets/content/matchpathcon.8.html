       <b>matchpathcon </b>queries the system policy and outputs the default
       security context associated with the filepath.

       <b>Note: </b>Identical paths can have different security contexts,
       depending on the file type (regular file, directory, link file,
       char file ...).

       <b>matchpathcon </b>will also take the file type into consideration in
       determining the default security context if the file exists.  If
       the file does not exist, no file type matching will occur.
