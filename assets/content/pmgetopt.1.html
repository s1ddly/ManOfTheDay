       <b>pmgetopt </b>is used to perform command line option parsing for shell
       scripts used in the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP toolkit).  It is
       also used to generate usage messages for those scripts.

       The parameters given to <b>pmgetopt </b>take two forms: initially,
       options specific to <b>pmgetopt </b>itself are passed in, and terminated
       using the -- mechanism.  Thereafter, all of the parameters passed
       into the shell script should be passed (usually this is simply
       the "$@" variable).
