       <b>xfs_quota </b>is a utility for reporting and editing various aspects
       of filesystem quota.

       The options to <b>xfs_quota </b>are:

       <b>-c </b><i>cmd</i> <b>xfs_quota </b>commands may be run interactively (the default)
              or as arguments on the command line. Multiple <b>-c </b>arguments
              may be given.  The commands are run in the sequence given,
              then the program exits.

       <b>-p </b><i>prog</i>
              Set the program name for prompts and some error messages,
              the default value is <b>xfs_quota</b>.

       <b>-x     </b>Enable expert mode.  All of the administrative commands
              (see the ADMINISTRATOR COMMANDS section below) which allow
              modifications to the quota system are available only in
              expert mode.

       <b>-f     </b>Enable foreign filesystem mode.  A limited number of user
              and administrative commands are available for use on some
              foreign (non-XFS) filesystems.

       <b>-d </b><i>project</i>
              Project names or numeric identifiers may be specified with
              this option, which restricts the output of the individual
              <b>xfs_quota </b>commands to the set of projects specified.
              Multiple <b>-d </b>arguments may be given.

       <b>-D </b><i>projects_file</i>
              Specify a file containing the mapping of numeric project
              identifiers to directory trees.  <i>/etc/projects</i> as default,
              if this option is none.

       <b>-P </b><i>projid_file</i>
              Specify a file containing the mapping of numeric project
              identifiers to project names.  <i>/etc/projid</i> as default, if
              this option is none.

       <b>-V     </b>Prints the version number and exits.

       The optional <i>path</i> argument(s) can be used to specify mount points
       or device files which identify XFS filesystems. The output of the
       individual <b>xfs_quota </b>commands will then be restricted to the set
       of filesystems specified.

       This manual page is divided into two sections - firstly,
       information for users of filesystems with quota enabled, and the
       <b>xfs_quota </b>commands of interest to such users; and then
       information which is useful only to administrators of XFS
       filesystems using quota and the quota commands which allow
       modifications to the quota system.

       Note that common to almost all of the individual commands
       described below are the options for specifying which quota types
       are of interest - user quota (<b>-u</b>), group quota (<b>-g</b>), and/or
       project quota (<b>-p</b>).  Also, several commands provide options to
       operate on "blocks used" (<b>-b</b>), "inodes used" (<b>-i</b>), and/or
       "realtime blocks used" (<b>-r</b>).

       Many commands also have extensive online help. Use the <b>help</b>
       command for more details on any command.
