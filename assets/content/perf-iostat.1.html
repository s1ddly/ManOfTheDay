       Mode is intended to provide four I/O performance metrics per each
       PCIe root port:

       •   Inbound Read - I/O devices below root port read from the host
           memory, in MB

       •   Inbound Write - I/O devices below root port write to the host
           memory, in MB

       •   Outbound Read - CPU reads from I/O devices below root port,
           in MB

       •   Outbound Write - CPU writes to I/O devices below root port,
           in MB
