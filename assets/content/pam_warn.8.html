       pam_warn is a PAM module that logs the service, terminal, user,
       remote user and remote host to <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/syslog.3.html">syslog(3)</a>. The items are not
       probed for, but instead obtained from the standard PAM items. The
       module always returns <b>PAM_IGNORE</b>, indicating that it does not
       want to affect the authentication process.
