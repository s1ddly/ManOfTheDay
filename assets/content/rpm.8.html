<pre>
       <b>rpm </b>is a powerful <b>Package Manager</b>, which can be used to build,
       install, query, verify, update, and erase individual software
       packages.  A <b>package </b>consists of an archive of files and meta-
       data used to install and erase the archive files.  The meta-data
       includes helper scripts, file attributes, and descriptive
       information about the package.  <b>Packages </b>come in two varieties:
       binary packages, used to encapsulate software to be installed,
       and source packages, containing the source code and recipe
       necessary to produce binary packages.

       One of the following basic modes must be selected: <b>Query</b>, <b>Verify</b>,
       <b>Install/Upgrade/Freshen/Reinstall</b>, <b>Uninstall</b>, <b>Set Owners/Groups</b>,
       <b>Show Querytags</b>, and <b>Show Configuration</b>.

   <b>GENERAL OPTIONS</b>
       These options can be used in all the different modes.

       <b>-?, --help</b>
              Print a longer usage message than normal.

       <b>--version</b>
              Print a single line containing the version number of <b>rpm</b>
              being used.

       <b>--quiet</b>
              Print as little as possible - normally only error messages
              will be displayed.

       <b>-v, --verbose</b>
              Print verbose information - normally routine progress
              messages will be displayed.

       <b>-vv    </b>Print lots of ugly debugging information.

       <b>--rcfile </b><i>FILELIST</i>
              Replace the list of configuration files to be read.  Each
              of the files in the colon separated <i>FILELIST</i> is read
              sequentially by <b>rpm </b>for configuration information.  Only
              the first file in the list must exist, and tildes will be
              expanded to the value of <b>$HOME</b>.  The default <i>FILELIST</i> is
              <i>/usr/lib/rpm/rpmrc</i>:<i>/usr/lib/rpm/redhat/rpmrc</i>:<i>/etc/rpmrc</i>:<i>~/.rpmrc</i>.

       <b>--load </b><i>FILE</i>
              Load an individual macro file.

       <b>--macros </b><i>FILELIST</i>
              Replace the list of macro files to be loaded.  Each of the
              files in the colon separated <i>FILELIST</i> is read sequentially
              by <b>rpm </b>for macro definitions.  Only the first file in the
              list must exist, and tildes will be expanded to the value
              of <b>$HOME</b>.  The default <i>FILELIST</i> is
              <i>/usr/lib/rpm/macros</i>:<i>/usr/lib/rpm/macros.d/macros.*</i>:<i>/usr/lib/rpm/platform/%{_target}/macros</i>:<i>/usr/lib/rpm/fileattrs/*.attr</i>:<i>/usr/lib/rpm/redhat/macros</i>:<i>/etc/rpm/macros.*</i>:<i>/etc/rpm/macros</i>:<i>/etc/rpm/%{_target}/macros</i>:<i>~/.rpmmacros</i>

       <b>--pipe </b><i>CMD</i>
              Pipes the output of <b>rpm </b>to the command <i>CMD</i>.

       <b>--dbpath </b><i>DIRECTORY</i>
              Use the database in <i>DIRECTORY</i> rather than the default path
              <i>/var/lib/rpm</i>

       <b>--root </b><i>DIRECTORY</i>
              Use the file system tree rooted at <i>DIRECTORY</i> for all
              operations.  Note that this means the database within
              <i>DIRECTORY</i> will be used for dependency checks and any
              scriptlet(s) (e.g. <b>%post </b>if installing, or <b>%prep </b>if
              building, a package) will be run after a chroot(2) to
              <i>DIRECTORY</i>.

       <b>-D, --define='</b><i>MACRO EXPR</i><b>'</b>
              Defines <i>MACRO</i> with value <i>EXPR</i>.

       <b>--undefine='</b><i>MACRO</i><b>'</b>
              Undefines <i>MACRO</i>.

       <b>-E, --eval='</b><i>EXPR</i><b>'</b>
              Prints macro expansion of <i>EXPR</i>.

       More - less often needed - options can be found on the <b>rpm-</b>
       <b>misc(8) </b>man page.

   <b>INSTALL AND UPGRADE OPTIONS</b>
       In these options, <i>PACKAGE_FILE</i> can be either <b>rpm </b>binary file or
       ASCII package manifest (see <b>PACKAGE SELECTION OPTIONS</b>), and may
       be specified as an <b>ftp </b>or <b>http </b>URL, in which case the package
       will be downloaded before being installed.  See <b>FTP/HTTP OPTIONS</b>
       for information on <b>rpm</b>'s <b>ftp </b>and <b>http </b>client support.

       The general form of an rpm install command is

       <b>rpm </b>{<b>-i|--install</b>} [<b>install-options</b>] <i>PACKAGE_FILE ...</i>

       This installs a new package.

       The general form of an rpm upgrade command is

       <b>rpm </b>{<b>-U|--upgrade</b>} [<b>install-options</b>] <i>PACKAGE_FILE ...</i>

       This upgrades or installs the package currently installed to a
       newer version.  This is the same as install, except all other
       version(s) of the package are removed after the new package is
       installed.

       <b>rpm </b>{<b>-F|--freshen</b>} [<b>install-options</b>] <i>PACKAGE_FILE ...</i>

       This will upgrade packages, but only ones for which an earlier
       version is installed.

       The general form of an rpm reinstall command is

       <b>rpm </b>{<b>--reinstall</b>} [<b>install-options</b>] <i>PACKAGE_FILE ...</i>

       This reinstalls a previously installed package.

       <b>--allfiles</b>
              Installs or upgrades all the missingok files in the
              package, regardless if they exist.

       <b>--badreloc</b>
              Used with <b>--relocate</b>, permit relocations on all file
              paths, not just those <i>OLDPATH</i>'s included in the binary
              package relocation hint(s).

       <b>--excludepath </b><i>OLDPATH</i>
              Don't install files whose name begins with <i>OLDPATH</i>.

       <b>--excludeartifacts</b>
              Don't install any files which are marked as artifacts,
              such as build-id links.

       <b>--excludedocs</b>
              Don't install any files which are marked as documentation
              (which includes man pages and texinfo documents).

       <b>--force</b>
              Same as using <b>--replacepkgs</b>, <b>--replacefiles</b>, and
              <b>--oldpackage</b>.

       <b>-h, --hash</b>
              Print 50 hash marks as the package archive is unpacked.
              Use with <b>-v|--verbose </b>for a nicer display.

       <b>--ignoresize</b>
              Don't check mount file systems for sufficient disk space
              before installing this package.

       <b>--ignorearch</b>
              Allow installation or upgrading even if the architectures
              of the binary package and host don't match.

       <b>--ignoreos</b>
              Allow installation or upgrading even if the operating
              systems of the binary package and host don't match.

       <b>--includedocs</b>
              Install documentation files.  This is the default
              behavior.

       <b>--justdb</b>
              Update only the database, not the filesystem.

       <b>--nodigest</b>
              Don't verify package or header digests when reading.

       <b>--nomanifest</b>
              Don't process non-package files as manifests.

       <b>--nosignature</b>
              Don't verify package or header signatures when reading.

       <b>--nodeps</b>
              Don't do a dependency check before installing or upgrading
              a package.

       <b>--nocaps</b>
              Don't set file capabilities.

       <b>--noorder</b>
              Don't reorder the packages for an install.  The list of
              packages would normally be reordered to satisfy
              dependencies.

       <b>--noverify</b>
              Don't perform verify package files prior to installation.

       <b>--noplugins</b>
              Do not load and execute plugins.

       <b>--noscripts</b>, <b>--nopre</b>, <b>--nopost</b>, <b>--nopreun</b>, <b>--nopostun</b>,
       <b>--nopretrans</b>, <b>--noposttrans</b>
              Don't execute the scriptlet of the same name.  The
              <b>--noscripts </b>option is equivalent to

       <b>--nopre --nopost --nopreun --nopostun --nopretrans --noposttrans</b>

       and turns off the execution of the corresponding <b>%pre</b>, <b>%post</b>,
       <b>%preun</b>, <b>%postun %pretrans</b>, and <b>%posttrans </b>scriptlet(s).

       <b>--notriggers</b>, <b>--notriggerin</b>, <b>--notriggerun</b>, <b>--notriggerprein</b>,
       <b>--notriggerpostun</b>
              Don't execute any trigger scriptlet of the named type.
              The <b>--notriggers </b>option is equivalent to

       <b>--notriggerprein --notriggerin --notriggerun --notriggerpostun</b>

       and turns off execution of the corresponding <b>%triggerprein</b>,
       <b>%triggerin</b>, <b>%triggerun</b>, and <b>%triggerpostun </b>scriptlet(s).

       <b>--oldpackage</b>
              Allow an upgrade to replace a newer package with an older
              one.

       <b>--percent</b>
              Print percentages as files are unpacked from the package
              archive.  This is intended to make <b>rpm </b>easy to run from
              other tools.

       <b>--prefix </b><i>NEWPATH</i>
              For relocatable binary packages, translate all file paths
              that start with the installation prefix in the package
              relocation hint(s) to <i>NEWPATH</i>.

       <b>--relocate </b><i>OLDPATH</i><b>=</b><i>NEWPATH</i>
              For relocatable binary packages, translate all file paths
              that start with <i>OLDPATH</i> in the package relocation hint(s)
              to <i>NEWPATH</i>.  This option can be used repeatedly if several
              <i>OLDPATH</i>'s in the package are to be relocated.

       <b>--replacefiles</b>
              Install the packages even if they replace files from
              other, already installed, packages.

       <b>--replacepkgs</b>
              Install the packages even if some of them are already
              installed on this system.

       <b>--test </b>Do not install the package, simply check for and report
              potential conflicts.

   <b>ERASE OPTIONS</b>
       The general form of an rpm erase command is

       <b>rpm </b>{<b>-e|--erase</b>} [<b>--allmatches</b>] [<b>--justdb] [--nodeps</b>]
       [<b>--noscripts</b>] [<b>--notriggers</b>] [<b>--test</b>] <i>PACKAGE_NAME ...</i>

       The following options may also be used:

       <b>--allmatches</b>
              Remove all versions of the package which match
              <i>PACKAGE_NAME</i>.  Normally an error is issued if <i>PACKAGE_NAME</i>
              matches multiple packages.

       <b>--justdb</b>
              Update only the database, not the filesystem.

       <b>--nodeps</b>
              Don't check dependencies before uninstalling the packages.

       <b>--noscripts</b>, <b>--nopreun</b>, <b>--nopostun</b>
              Don't execute the scriptlet of the same name.  The
              <b>--noscripts </b>option during package erase is equivalent to

       <b>--nopreun --nopostun</b>

       and turns off the execution of the corresponding <b>%preun</b>, and
       <b>%postun </b>scriptlet(s).

       <b>--notriggers</b>, <b>--notriggerun</b>, <b>--notriggerpostun</b>
              Don't execute any trigger scriptlet of the named type.
              The <b>--notriggers </b>option is equivalent to

       <b>--notriggerun --notriggerpostun</b>

       and turns off execution of the corresponding <b>%triggerun</b>, and
       <b>%triggerpostun </b>scriptlet(s).

       <b>--test </b>Don't really uninstall anything, just go through the
              motions.  Useful in conjunction with the <b>-vv </b>option for
              debugging.

   <b>QUERY OPTIONS</b>
       The general form of an rpm query command is

       <b>rpm </b>{<b>-q|--query</b>} [<b>select-options</b>] [<b>query-options</b>]

       You may specify the format that package information should be
       printed in.  To do this, you use the

       <b>--qf|--queryformat </b><i>QUERYFMT</i>

       option, followed by the <i>QUERYFMT</i> format string.  Query formats
       are modified versions of the standard <b>printf(3) </b>formatting.  The
       format is made up of static strings (which may include standard C
       character escapes for newlines, tabs, and other special
       characters) and <b>printf(3) </b>type formatters.  As <b>rpm </b>already knows
       the type to print, the type specifier must be omitted however,
       and replaced by the name of the header tag to be printed,
       enclosed by <b>{} </b>characters.  Tag names are case insensitive, and
       the leading <b>RPMTAG_ </b>portion of the tag name may be omitted as
       well.

       Alternate output formats may be requested by following the tag
       with <b>:</b><i>typetag</i>.  Currently, the following types are supported:

       <b>:armor </b>Wrap a public key in ASCII armor.

       <b>:arraysize</b>
              Display number of elements in array tags.

       <b>:base64</b>
              Encode binary data using base64.

       <b>:date  </b>Use strftime(3) "%c" format.

       <b>:day   </b>Use strftime(3) "%a %b %d %Y" format.

       <b>:depflags</b>
              Format dependency comparison operator.

       <b>:deptype</b>
              Format dependency type.

       <b>:expand</b>
              Perform macro expansion.

       <b>:fflags</b>
              Format file flags.

       <b>:fstate</b>
              Format file state.

       <b>:fstatus</b>
              Format file verify status.

       <b>:hex   </b>Format in hexadecimal.

       <b>:octal </b>Format in octal.

       <b>:humaniec</b>
              Human readable number (in IEC 80000).  The suffix K =
              1024, M = 1048576, ...

       <b>:humansi</b>
              Human readable number (in SI).  The suffix K = 1000, M =
              1000000, ...

       <b>:perms </b>Format file permissions.

       <b>:pgpsig</b>
              Display signature fingerprint and time.

       <b>:shescape</b>
              Escape single quotes for use in a script.

       <b>:string</b>
              Display string format.  (default)

       <b>:tagname</b>
              Display tag name.

       <b>:tagnum</b>
              Display tag number.

       <b>:triggertype</b>
              Display trigger suffix.

       <b>:vflags</b>
              File verification flags.

       <b>:xml   </b>Wrap data in simple xml markup.

       For example, to print only the names of the packages queried, you
       could use <b>%{NAME} </b>as the format string.  To print the packages
       name and distribution information in two columns, you could use
       <b>%-30{NAME}%{DISTRIBUTION}</b>.  <b>rpm </b>will print a list of all of the
       tags it knows about when it is invoked with the <b>--querytags</b>
       argument.

       There are three subsets of options for querying: package
       selection, file selection and information selection.

   <b>PACKAGE SELECTION OPTIONS:</b>
       <i>PACKAGE_NAME</i>
              Query installed package named <i>PACKAGE_NAME</i>.  To specify
              the package more precisely the package name may be
              followed by the version or version and release both
              separated by a dash or an architecture name separated by a
              dot.  See the output of <b>rpm -qa </b>or <b>rpm -qp </b><i>PACKAGE_FILE</i> as
              an example.

       <b>-a, --all [</b><i>SELECTOR</i>]
              Query all installed packages.

       An optional <i>SELECTOR</i> in the form of tag=pattern can be provided
       to narrow the selection, for example name="b*" to query packages
       whose name starts with "b".

       <b>--dupes</b>
              List duplicated packages.

       <b>-f, --file </b><i>FILE</i>
              Query package owning <i>FILE</i>.

       <b>--filecaps</b>
              List file names with POSIX1.e capabilities.

       <b>--fileclass</b>
              List file names with their classes (libmagic
              classification).

       <b>--filecolor</b>
              List file names with their colors (0 for noarch, 1 for
              32bit, 2 for 64 bit).

       <b>--fileprovide</b>
              List file names with their provides.

       <b>--filerequire</b>
              List file names with their requires.

       <b>-g, --group </b><i>GROUP</i>
              Query packages with the group of <i>GROUP</i>.

       <b>--hdrid </b><i>SHA1</i>
              Query package that contains a given header identifier,
              i.e. the <i>SHA1</i> digest of the immutable header region.

       <b>-p, --package </b><i>PACKAGE_FILE</i>
              Query an (uninstalled) package <i>PACKAGE_FILE</i>.  The
              <i>PACKAGE_FILE</i> may be specified as an <b>ftp </b>or <b>http </b>style URL,
              in which case the package header will be downloaded and
              queried.  See <b>FTP/HTTP OPTIONS </b>for information on <b>rpm</b>'s
              <b>ftp </b>and <b>http </b>client support.  The <i>PACKAGE_FILE</i>
              argument(s), if not a binary package, will be interpreted
              as an ASCII package manifest unless <b>--nomanifest </b>option is
              used.  In manifests, comments are permitted, starting with
              a '#', and each line of a package manifest file may
              include white space separated glob expressions, including
              URL's, that will be expanded to paths that are substituted
              in place of the package manifest as additional
              <i>PACKAGE_FILE</i> arguments to the query.

       <b>--pkgid </b><i>MD5</i>
              Query package that contains a given package identifier,
              i.e. the <i>MD5</i> digest of the combined header and payload
              contents.

       <b>--querybynumber </b><i>HDRNUM</i>
              Query the <i>HDRNUM</i>th database entry directly; this is useful
              only for debugging.

       <b>--specfile </b><i>SPECFILE</i>
              Parse and query <i>SPECFILE</i> as if it were a package.
              Although not all the information (e.g. file lists) is
              available, this type of query permits rpm to be used to
              extract information from spec files without having to
              write a specfile parser.

       <b>--tid </b><i>TID</i>
              Query package(s) that have a given <i>TID</i> transaction
              identifier.  A unix time stamp is currently used as a
              transaction identifier.  All package(s) installed or
              erased within a single transaction have a common
              identifier.

       <b>--triggeredby </b><i>PACKAGE_NAME</i>
              Query packages that are triggered by package(s)
              <i>PACKAGE_NAME</i>.

       <b>--whatobsoletes </b><i>CAPABILITY</i>
              Query all packages that obsolete <i>CAPABILITY</i> for proper
              functioning.

       <b>--whatprovides </b><i>CAPABILITY</i>
              Query all packages that provide the <i>CAPABILITY</i> capability.

       <b>--whatrequires </b><i>CAPABILITY</i>
              Query all packages that require <i>CAPABILITY</i> for proper
              functioning.

       <b>--whatconflicts </b><i>CAPABILITY</i>
              Query all packages that conflict with <i>CAPABILITY</i>.

       <b>--whatrecommends </b><i>CAPABILITY</i>
              Query all packages that recommend <i>CAPABILITY</i>.

   <b>VERIFY OPTIONS</b>
       The general form of an rpm verify command is

       <b>rpm </b>{<b>-V|--verify</b>} [<b>select-options</b>] [<b>verify-options</b>]

       Verifying a package compares information about the installed
       files in the package with information about the files taken from
       the package metadata stored in the rpm database.  Among other
       things, verifying compares the size, digest, permissions, type,
       owner and group of each file.  Any discrepancies are displayed.
       Files that were not installed from the package, for example,
       documentation files excluded on installation using the
       "<b>--excludedocs</b>" option, will be silently ignored.

       The package and file selection options are the same as for
       package querying (including package manifest files as arguments).
       Other options unique to verify mode are:

       <b>--nodeps</b>
              Don't verify dependencies of packages.

       <b>--nodigest</b>
              Don't verify package or header digests when reading.

       <b>--nofiles</b>
              Don't verify any attributes of package files.

       <b>--noscripts</b>
              Don't execute the <b>%verifyscript </b>scriptlet (if any).

       <b>--nosignature</b>
              Don't verify package or header signatures when reading.

       <b>--nolinkto</b>

       <b>--nofiledigest </b>(formerly <b>--nomd5</b>)

       <b>--nosize</b>

       <b>--nouser</b>

       <b>--nogroup</b>

       <b>--nomtime</b>

       <b>--nomode</b>

       <b>--nordev</b>
              Don't verify the corresponding file attribute.

       <b>--nocaps</b>
              Don't verify file capabilities.

       The format of the output is a string of 9 characters, a possible
       attribute marker:

              c %config configuration file.
              d %doc documentation file.
              g %ghost file (i.e. the file contents are not included in the package payload).
              l %license license file.
              r %readme readme file.

       from the package header, followed by the file name.  Each of the
       9 characters denotes the result of a comparison of attribute(s)
       of the file to the value of those attribute(s) recorded in the
       database.  A single "<b>.</b>" (period) means the test passed, while a
       single "<b>?</b>" (question mark) indicates the test could not be
       performed (e.g. file permissions prevent reading).  Otherwise,
       the (mnemonically em<b>B</b>oldened) character denotes failure of the
       corresponding <b>--verify </b>test:

              S file Size differs
              M Mode differs (includes permissions and file type)
              5 digest (formerly MD5 sum) differs
              D Device major/minor number mismatch
              L readLink(2) path mismatch
              U User ownership differs
              G Group ownership differs
              T mTime differs
              P caPabilities differ

   <b>MISCELLANEOUS COMMANDS</b>
       <b>rpm --showrc</b>
              shows the values <b>rpm </b>will use for all of the options are
              currently set in <i>rpmrc</i> and <i>macros</i> configuration file(s).

       <b>rpm --setperms </b><i>PACKAGE_NAME</i>
              sets permissions of files in the given package.  Consider
              using <b>--restore </b>instead.

       <b>rpm --setugids </b><i>PACKAGE_NAME</i>
              sets user/group ownership of files in the given package.
              This command can change permissions and capabilities of
              files in that package.  In most cases it is better to use
              <b>--restore </b>instead.

       <b>rpm --setcaps </b><i>PACKAGE_NAME</i>
              sets capabilities of files in the given package.  Consider
              using <b>--restore </b>instead.

       <b>rpm --restore </b><i>PACKAGE_NAME</i>
              The option restores owner, group, permissions and
              capabilities of files in the given package.

       Options <b>--setperms</b>, <b>--setugids</b>, <b>--setcaps </b>and
              <b>--restore </b>are mutually exclusive.

   <b>FTP/HTTP OPTIONS</b>
       <b>rpm </b>can act as an FTP and/or HTTP client so that packages can be
       queried or installed from the internet.  Package files for
       install, upgrade, and query operations may be specified as an <b>ftp</b>
       or <b>http </b>style URL:

       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pagestp://HOST[:PORT]/path/to/package.rpm">http://HOST[:PORT]/path/to/package.rpm</a>

       ftp://[USER:PASSWORD]@HOST[:PORT]/path/to/package.rpm

       If both the user and password are omitted, anonymous <b>ftp </b>is used.

       <b>rpm </b>allows the following options to be used with ftp URLs:

       <b>rpm </b>allows the following options to be used with
              <b>http </b>and <b>ftp </b>URLs:

       <b>--httpproxy </b><i>HOST</i>
              The host <i>HOST</i> will be used as a proxy server for all <b>http</b>
              and <b>ftp </b>transfers.  This option may also be specified by
              configuring the macro <b>%_httpproxy</b>.

       <b>--httpport </b><i>PORT</i>
              The TCP <i>PORT</i> number to use for the <b>http </b>connection on the
              proxy http server instead of the default port.  This
              option may also be specified by configuring the macro
              <b>%_httpport</b>.
