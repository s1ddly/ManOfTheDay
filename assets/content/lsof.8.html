       <i>Lsof</i> revision 4.91 lists on its standard output file information
       about files opened by processes for the following UNIX dialects:

            Apple Darwin 9 and Mac OS X 10.[567]
            FreeBSD 8.[234], 9.0 and 1[012].0 for AMD64-based systems
            Linux 2.1.72 and above for x86-based systems
            Solaris 9, 10 and 11

       (See the <b>DISTRIBUTION </b>section of this manual page for information
       on how to obtain the latest <i>lsof</i> revision.)

       An open file may be a regular file, a directory, a block special
       file, a character special file, an executing text reference, a
       library, a stream or a network file (Internet socket, NFS file or
       UNIX domain socket.)  A specific file or all the files in a file
       system may be selected by path.

       Instead of a formatted display, <i>lsof</i> will produce output that can
       be parsed by other programs.  See the <b>-F</b>, option description, and
       the <b>OUTPUT FOR OTHER PROGRAMS </b>section for more information.

       In addition to producing a single output list, <i>lsof</i> will run in
       repeat mode.  In repeat mode it will produce output, delay, then
       repeat the output operation until stopped with an interrupt or
       quit signal.  See the <b>+|-r </b><i>[t[m&lt;fmt&gt;]]</i> option description for
       more information.
