       Given a device or disk-image, <b>partx </b>tries to parse the partition
       table and list its contents. It can also tell the kernel to add
       or remove partitions from its bookkeeping.

       The <i>disk</i> argument is optional when a <i>partition</i> argument is
       provided. To force scanning a partition as if it were a whole
       disk (for example to list nested subpartitions), use the argument
       "-" (hyphen-minus). For example:

          partx --show - /dev/sda3

       This will see sda3 as a whole-disk rather than as a partition.

       <b>partx is not an fdisk program </b>- adding and removing partitions
       does not change the disk, it just tells the kernel about the
       presence and numbering of on-disk partitions.
