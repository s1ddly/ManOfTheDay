       <b>rpmgraph </b>uses <i>PACKAGE_FILE</i> arguments to generate a package
       dependency graph.  Each <i>PACKAGE_FILE</i> argument is read and added
       to an rpm transaction set.  The elements of the transaction set
       are partially ordered using a topological sort.  The partially
       ordered elements are then printed to standard output.

       Nodes in the dependency graph are package names, and edges in the
       directed graph point to the parent of each node.  The parent node
       is defined as the last predecessor of a package when partially
       ordered using the package dependencies as a relation.  That means
       that the parent of a given package is the package's last
       prerequisite.

       The output is in <b>dot</b>(1) directed graph format, and can be
       displayed or printed using the <b>dotty </b>graph editor from the
       <b>graphviz </b>package.  There are no <b>rpmgraph </b>specific options, only
       common <b>rpm </b>options.  See the <b>rpmgraph </b>usage message for what is
       currently implemented.
