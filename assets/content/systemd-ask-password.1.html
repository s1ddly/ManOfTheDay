       <b>systemd-ask-password </b>may be used to query a system password or
       passphrase from the user, using a question message specified on
       the command line. When run from a TTY it will query a password on
       the TTY and print it to standard output. When run with no TTY or
       with <b>--no-tty </b>it will use the system-wide query mechanism, which
       allows active users to respond via several agents, listed below.

       The purpose of this tool is to query system-wide passwords — that
       is passwords not attached to a specific user account. Examples
       include: unlocking encrypted hard disks when they are plugged in
       or at boot, entering an SSL certificate passphrase for web and
       VPN servers.

       Existing agents are:

       •   A boot-time password agent asking the user for passwords
           using <b>plymouth</b>(8),

       •   A boot-time password agent querying the user directly on the
           console — <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/systemd-ask-password-console.service.8.html">systemd-ask-password-console.service(8)</a>,

       •   An agent requesting password input via a <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/wall.1.html">wall(1)</a> message —
           <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/systemd-ask-password-wall.service.8.html">systemd-ask-password-wall.service(8)</a>,

       •   A TTY agent that is temporarily spawned during <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/systemctl.1.html">systemctl(1)</a>
           invocations,

       •   A command line agent which can be started temporarily to
           process queued password requests —
           <b>systemd-tty-ask-password-agent --query</b>.

       Answering system-wide password queries is a privileged operation,
       hence all the agents listed above (except for the last one), run
       as privileged system services. The last one also needs elevated
       privileges, so should be run through <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/sudo.8.html">sudo(8)</a> or similar.

       Additional password agents may be implemented according to the
       <b>systemd Password Agent Specification</b><b></b>[1].

       If a password is queried on a TTY, the user may press TAB to hide
       the asterisks normally shown for each character typed. Pressing
       Backspace as first key achieves the same effect.
