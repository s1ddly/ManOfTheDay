       To send a message to a batch job is to request that a server
       write a message string into one or more output files of the batch
       job. A message is sent to a batch job by a request to the batch
       server that manages the batch job. The <i>qmsg</i> utility is a user-
       accessible batch client that requests the sending of messages to
       one or more batch jobs.

       The <i>qmsg</i> utility shall write messages into the files of batch
       jobs by sending a <i>Job Message Request</i> to the batch server that
       manages the batch job. The <i>qmsg</i> utility shall not directly write
       the message into the files of the batch job.

       The <i>qmsg</i> utility shall send a <i>Job Message Request</i> for those batch
       jobs, and only those batch jobs, for which a batch <i>job_identifier</i>
       is presented to the utility.

       The <i>qmsg</i> utility shall send <i>Job Message Request</i>s for batch jobs
       in the order in which their batch <i>job_identifier</i>s are presented
       to the utility.

       If the <i>qmsg</i> utility fails to process any batch <i>job_identifier</i>
       successfully, the utility shall proceed to process the remaining
       batch <i>job_identifier</i>s, if any.

       The <i>qmsg</i> utility shall not exit before a <i>Job Message Request</i> has
       been sent to the server that manages the batch job that
       corresponds to each successfully processed batch <i>job_identifier</i>.
