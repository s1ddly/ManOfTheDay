       <b>openvt </b>will find the first available VT, and run on it the given
       <b>command </b>with the given <b>command options , </b>standard input, output
       and error are directed to that terminal. The current search path
       ($PATH) is used to find the requested command. If no command is
       specified then the environment variable $SHELL is used.

   <b>OPTIONS</b>
       <i>-c, --console=VTNUMBER</i>
              Use the given VT number and not the first available. Note
              you must have write access to the supplied VT for this to
              work.

       <i>-f, --force</i>
              Force opening a VT without checking whether it is already
              in use.

       <i>-e, --exec</i>
              Directly execute the given command, without forking.  This
              option is meant for use in <i>/etc/inittab</i>.

       <i>-s, --switch</i>
              Switch to the new VT when starting the command. The VT of
              the new command will be made the new current VT.

       <i>-u, --user</i>
              Figure out the owner of the current VT, and run login as
              that user.  Suitable to be called by init. Shouldn't be
              used with <i>-c</i> or <i>-l</i>.

       <i>-l, --login</i>
              Make the command a login shell. A - is prepended to the
              name of the command to be executed.

              Be a bit more verbose.

       <i>-w, --wait</i>
              wait for command to complete. If -w and -s are used
              together then <b>openvt </b>will switch back to the controlling
              terminal when the command completes.

       <i>-V, --version</i>
              print program version and exit.
