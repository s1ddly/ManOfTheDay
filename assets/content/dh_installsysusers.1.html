       <b>dh_installsysusers </b>is a debhelper program that is responsible for
       installing package maintainer supplied systemd sysusers files.

       It also finds the systemd sysusers files installed in a package
       and generates relevant integration snippets for enabling the
       users on installation.  These snippets are added to the package
       by <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dh_installdeb.1.html">dh_installdeb(1)</a>.
