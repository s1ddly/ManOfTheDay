       Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) refers to multiprocessor systems
       whose memory is divided into multiple memory nodes.  The access
       time of a memory node depends on the relative locations of the
       accessing CPU and the accessed node.  (This contrasts with a
       symmetric multiprocessor system, where the access time for all of
       the memory is the same for all CPUs.)  Normally, each CPU on a
       NUMA system has a local memory node whose contents can be
       accessed faster than the memory in the node local to another CPU
       or the memory on a bus shared by all CPUs.

   <b>NUMA system calls</b>
       The Linux kernel implements the following NUMA-related system
       calls: <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/get_mempolicy.2.html">get_mempolicy(2)</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mbind.2.html">mbind(2)</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/migrate_pages.2.html">migrate_pages(2)</a>,
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/move_pages.2.html">move_pages(2)</a>, and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/set_mempolicy.2.html">set_mempolicy(2)</a>.  However, applications
       should normally use the interface provided by <i>libnuma</i>; see
       "Library Support" below.

   <b>/proc/[number]/numa_maps (since Linux 2.6.14)</b>
       This file displays information about a process's NUMA memory
       policy and allocation.

       Each line contains information about a memory range used by the
       process, displaying—among other information—the effective memory
       policy for that memory range and on which nodes the pages have
       been allocated.

       <i>numa_maps</i> is a read-only file.  When <i>/proc/&lt;pid&gt;/numa_maps</i> is
       read, the kernel will scan the virtual address space of the
       process and report how memory is used.  One line is displayed for
       each unique memory range of the process.

       The first field of each line shows the starting address of the
       memory range.  This field allows a correlation with the contents
       of the <i>/proc/&lt;pid&gt;/maps</i> file, which contains the end address of
       the range and other information, such as the access permissions
       and sharing.

       The second field shows the memory policy currently in effect for
       the memory range.  Note that the effective policy is not
       necessarily the policy installed by the process for that memory
       range.  Specifically, if the process installed a "default" policy
       for that range, the effective policy for that range will be the
       process policy, which may or may not be "default".

       The rest of the line contains information about the pages
       allocated in the memory range, as follows:

       <i>N&lt;node&gt;=&lt;nr_pages&gt;</i>
              The number of pages allocated on <i>&lt;node&gt;</i>.  <i>&lt;nr_pages&gt;</i>
              includes only pages currently mapped by the process.  Page
              migration and memory reclaim may have temporarily unmapped
              pages associated with this memory range.  These pages may
              show up again only after the process has attempted to
              reference them.  If the memory range represents a shared
              memory area or file mapping, other processes may currently
              have additional pages mapped in a corresponding memory
              range.

       <i>file=&lt;filename&gt;</i>
              The file backing the memory range.  If the file is mapped
              as private, write accesses may have generated COW (Copy-
              On-Write) pages in this memory range.  These pages are
              displayed as anonymous pages.

       <i>heap</i>   Memory range is used for the heap.

       <i>stack</i>  Memory range is used for the stack.

       <i>huge</i>   Huge memory range.  The page counts shown are huge pages
              and not regular sized pages.

       <i>anon=&lt;pages&gt;</i>
              The number of anonymous page in the range.

       <i>dirty=&lt;pages&gt;</i>
              Number of dirty pages.

       <i>mapped=&lt;pages&gt;</i>
              Total number of mapped pages, if different from <i>dirty</i> and
              <i>anon</i> pages.

       <i>mapmax=&lt;count&gt;</i>
              Maximum mapcount (number of processes mapping a single
              page) encountered during the scan.  This may be used as an
              indicator of the degree of sharing occurring in a given
              memory range.

       <i>swapcache=&lt;count&gt;</i>
              Number of pages that have an associated entry on a swap
              device.

       <i>active=&lt;pages&gt;</i>
              The number of pages on the active list.  This field is
              shown only if different from the number of pages in this
              range.  This means that some inactive pages exist in the
              memory range that may be removed from memory by the
              swapper soon.

       <i>writeback=&lt;pages&gt;</i>
              Number of pages that are currently being written out to
              disk.
