       The <i>fort77</i> utility is the interface to the FORTRAN compilation
       system; it shall accept the full FORTRAN-77 language defined by
       the ANSI X3.9‐1978 standard. The system conceptually consists of
       a compiler and link editor. The files referenced by <i>operand</i>s are
       compiled and linked to produce an executable file. It is
       unspecified whether the linking occurs entirely within the
       operation of <i>fort77</i>; some implementations may produce objects
       that are not fully resolved until the file is executed.

       If the <b>-c </b>option is present, for all pathname operands of the
       form <i>file</i><b>.f</b>, the files:

           $(basename <i>pathname</i>.f).o

       shall be created or overwritten as the result of successful
       compilation. If the <b>-c </b>option is not specified, it is unspecified
       whether such <b>.o </b>files are created or deleted for the <i>file</i><b>.f</b>
       operands.

       If there are no options that prevent link editing (such as <b>-c</b>)
       and all operands compile and link without error, the resulting
       executable file shall be written into the file named by the <b>-o</b>
       option (if present) or to the file <b>a.out</b>.  The executable file
       shall be created as specified in the System Interfaces volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, except that the file permissions shall be set to:
       S_IRWXO | S_IRWXG | S_IRWXU

       and that the bits specified by the <i>umask</i> of the process shall be
       cleared.
