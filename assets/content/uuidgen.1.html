       The <b>uuidgen </b>program creates (and prints) a new universally unique
       identifier (UUID) using the <b>libuuid</b>(3) library. The new UUID can
       reasonably be considered unique among all UUIDs created on the
       local system, and among UUIDs created on other systems in the
       past and in the future.

       There are three types of UUIDs which <b>uuidgen </b>can generate:
       time-based UUIDs, random-based UUIDs, and hash-based UUIDs. By
       default <b>uuidgen </b>will generate a random-based UUID if a
       high-quality random number generator is present. Otherwise, it
       will choose a time-based UUID. It is possible to force the
       generation of one of these first two UUID types by using the
       <b>--random </b>or <b>--time </b>options.

       The third type of UUID is generated with the <b>--md5 </b>or <b>--sha1</b>
       options, followed by <b>--namespace </b><i>namespace</i> and <b>--name </b><i>name</i>. The
       <i>namespace</i> may either be a well-known UUID, or else an alias to
       one of the well-known UUIDs defined in RFC 4122, that is <b>@dns</b>,
       <b>@url</b>, <b>@oid</b>, or <b>@x500</b>. The <i>name</i> is an arbitrary string value. The
       generated UUID is the digest of the concatenation of the
       namespace UUID and the name value, hashed with the MD5 or SHA1
       algorithms. It is, therefore, a predictable value which may be
       useful when UUIDs are being used as handles or nonces for more
       complex values or values which shouldnâ€™t be disclosed directly.
       See the RFC for more information.
