<pre>
       Read a packed archive (.pack) from the standard input, expanding
       the objects contained within and writing them into the repository
       in "loose" (one object per file) format.

       Objects that already exist in the repository will <b>not </b>be unpacked
       from the packfile. Therefore, nothing will be unpacked if you use
       this command on a packfile that exists within the target
       repository.

       See <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/git-repack.1.html">git-repack(1)</a> for options to generate new packs and replace
       existing ones.
