       <b>xfs_bmap </b>prints the map of disk blocks used by files in an XFS
       filesystem.  The map lists each <i>extent</i> used by the file, as well
       as regions in the file that do not have any corresponding blocks
       (holes).  Each line of the listings takes the following form:

              <i>extent</i>: [<i>startoffset</i>..<i>endoffset</i>]: <i>startblock</i>..<i>endblock</i>

       Holes are marked by replacing the <i>startblock</i>..<i>endblock</i> with <i>hole</i>.
       All the file offsets and disk blocks are in units of 512-byte
       blocks, no matter what the filesystem's block size is.
