       The <b>ovsdb-tool </b>program is a command-line tool for managing Open
       vSwitch database (OVSDB) files.  It does not interact directly
       with running Open vSwitch database servers (instead, use
       <b>ovsdb-client</b>).  For an introduction to OVSDB and its
       implementation in Open vSwitch, see <b>ovsdb</b>(7).

       Each command that takes an optional <i>db</i> or <i>schema</i> argument has a
       default file location if it is not specified..  The default <i>db</i> is
       <b>/usr/local/etc/openvswitch/conf.db</b>.  The default <i>schema</i> is
       <b>/usr/local/share/openvswitch/vswitch.ovsschema</b>.

       This OVSDB implementation supports standalone and active-backup
       database service models with one on-disk format and a clustered
       database service model with a different format.  <b>ovsdb-tool</b>
       supports both formats, but some commands are appropriate for only
       one format, as documented for individual commands below.  For a
       specification of these formats, see <b>ovsdb</b>(5).  For more
       information on OVSDB service models, see the <b>Service Models</b>
       section in <b>ovsdb</b>(7).

   <b>Database Creation Commands</b>
       These commands create a new OVSDB database file.  They will not
       overwrite an existing database file.  To replace an existing
       database with a new one, first delete the old one.

       <b>create </b>[<i>db</i> [<i>schema</i>]]
              Use this command to create the database for controlling
              <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>or another standalone or active-backup
              database.  It creates database file <i>db</i> with the given
              <i>schema</i>, which must be the name of a file that contains an
              OVSDB schema in JSON format, as specified in the OVSDB
              specification.  The new database is initially empty.  (You
              can use <b>cp </b>to copy a database including both its schema
              and data.)

       [<b>--election-timer=</b><i>ms</i>] <b>create-cluster </b><i>db contents local</i>
              Use this command to initialize the first server in a high-
              availability cluster of 3 (or more) database servers, e.g.
              for a database in an environment that cannot tolerate a
              single point of failure.  It creates clustered database
              file <i>db</i> and configures the server to listen on <i>local</i>,
              which must take the form <i>protocol</i><b>:</b><i>ip</i><b>:</b><i>port</i>, where <i>protocol</i>
              is <b>tcp </b>or <b>ssl</b>, <i>ip</i> is the server's IP (either an IPv4
              address or an IPv6 address enclosed in square brackets),
              and <i>port</i> is a TCP port number.  Only one address is
              specified, for the first server in the cluster, ordinarily
              the one for the server running <b>create-cluster</b>.  The
              address is used for communication within the cluster, not
              for communicating with OVSDB clients, and must not use the
              same port used for the OVSDB protocol.

              The new database is initialized with <i>contents</i>, which must
              name a file that contains either an OVSDB schema in JSON
              format or a standalone OVSDB database.  If it is a schema
              file, the new database will initially be empty, with the
              given schema.  If it is a database file, the new database
              will have the same schema and contents.

              Leader election will be initiated by a follower if there
              is no heartbeat received from the cluster leader within
              the specified election timer.  The default leader election
              timer is 1000 miliseconds. To use a different value when
              creating the database, specify <b>--election-timer=</b><i>ms</i>, where
              <i>ms</i> is a value in miliseconds between 100 and 600000
              inclusive.

       [<b>--cid=</b><i>uuid</i>] <b>join-cluster </b><i>db name local remote</i>...
              Use this command to initialize each server after the first
              one in an OVSDB high-availability cluster.  It creates
              clustered database file <i>db</i> for a database named <i>name</i>, and
              configures the server to listen on <i>local</i> and to initially
              connect to <i>remote</i>, which must be a server that already
              belongs to the cluster.  <i>local</i> and <i>remote</i> use the same
              <i>protocol</i><b>:</b><i>ip</i><b>:</b><i>port</i> syntax as <b>create-cluster</b>.

              The <i>name</i> must be the name of the schema or database passed
              to <b>create-cluster</b>.  For example, the name of the OVN
              Southbound database schema is <b>OVN_Southbound</b>.  Use
              <b>ovsdb-tool</b>'s <b>schema-name </b>or <b>db-name </b>command to find out
              the name of a schema or database, respectively.

              This command does not do any network access, which means
              that it cannot actually join the new server to the
              cluster.  Instead, the <i>db</i> file that it creates prepares
              the server to join the cluster the first time that
              <b>ovsdb-server </b>serves it.  As part of joining the cluster,
              the new server retrieves the database schema and obtains
              the list of all cluster members.  Only after that does it
              become a full member of the cluster.

              Optionally, more than one <i>remote</i> may be specified; for
              example, in a cluster that already contains multiple
              servers, one could specify all the existing servers.  This
              is beneficial if some of the existing servers are down
              while the new server joins, but it is not otherwise
              needed.

              By default, the <i>db</i> created by <b>join-cluster </b>will join any
              clustered database named <i>name</i> that is available at a
              <i>remote</i>.  In theory, if machines go up and down and IP
              addresses change in the right way, it could join the wrong
              database cluster.  To avoid this possibility, specify
              <b>--cid=</b><i>uuid</i>, where <i>uuid</i> is the cluster ID of the cluster to
              join, as printed by <b>ovsdb-tool get-cid</b>.

   <b>Database Migration Commands</b>
       This commands will convert cluster database to standalone
       database.

       <b>cluster-to-standalone </b><i>db clusterdb</i>
              Use this command to convert to standalone database from
              clustered database when the cluster is down and cannot be
              revived. It creates new standalone <i>db</i> file from the given
              cluster <i>db</i> file.

   <b>Version Management Commands</b>
       An OVSDB schema has a schema version number, and an OVSDB
       database embeds a particular version of an OVSDB schema.  These
       version numbers take the form <i>x</i><b>.</b><i>y</i><b>.</b><i>z</i>, e.g. <b>1.2.3</b>.  The OVSDB
       implementation does not enforce a particular version numbering
       scheme, but schemas managed within the Open vSwitch project use
       the following approach.  Whenever the database schema is changed
       in a non-backward compatible way (e.g. deleting a column or a
       table), <i>x</i> is incremented (and <i>y</i> and <i>z</i> are reset to 0).  When the
       database schema is changed in a backward compatible way (e.g.
       adding a new column), <i>y</i> is incremented (and <i>z</i> is reset to 0).
       When the database schema is changed cosmetically (e.g.
       reindenting its syntax), <i>z</i> is incremented.

       Some OVSDB databases and schemas, especially very old ones, do
       not have a version number.

       Schema version numbers and Open vSwitch version numbers are
       independent.

       These commands work with different versions of OVSDB schemas and
       databases.

       <b>convert </b>[<i>db</i> [<i>schema</i> [<i>target</i>]]]
              Reads <i>db</i>, translating it into to the schema specified in
              <i>schema</i>, and writes out the new interpretation.  If <i>target</i>
              is specified, the translated version is written as a new
              file named <i>target</i>, which must not already exist.  If
              <i>target</i> is omitted, then the translated version of the
              database replaces <i>db</i> in-place.  In-place conversion cannot
              take place if the database is currently being served by
              <b>ovsdb-server </b>(instead, either stop <b>ovsdb-server </b>first or
              use <b>ovsdb-client</b>'s <b>convert </b>command).

              This command can do simple ``upgrades'' and ``downgrades''
              on a database's schema.  The data in <i>db</i> must be valid when
              interpreted under <i>schema</i>, with only one exception: data in
              <i>db</i> for tables and columns that do not exist in <i>schema</i> are
              ignored.  Columns that exist in <i>schema</i> but not in <i>db</i> are
              set to their default values.  All of <i>schema</i>'s constraints
              apply in full.

              Some uses of this command can cause unrecoverable data
              loss.  For example, converting a database from a schema
              that has a given column or table to one that does not will
              delete all data in that column or table.  Back up critical
              databases before converting them.

              This command is for standalone and active-backup databases
              only.  For clustered databases, use <b>ovsdb-client</b>'s <b>convert</b>
              command to convert them online.

       <b>needs-conversion </b>[<i>db</i> [<i>schema</i>]]
              Reads the schema embedded in <i>db</i> and the JSON schema from
              <i>schema</i> and compares them.  If the schemas are the same,
              prints <b>no </b>on stdout; if they differ, prints <b>yes</b>.

              This command is for standalone and active-backup databases
              only.  For clustered databases, use <b>ovsdb-client</b>'s <b>needs-</b>
              <b>conversion </b>command instead.

       <b>db-version </b>[<i>db</i>]
       <b>schema-version </b>[<i>schema</i>]
              Prints the version number in the schema embedded within
              the database <i>db</i> or in the JSON schema <i>schema</i> on stdout.
              If <i>schema</i> or <i>db</i> was created before schema versioning was
              introduced, then it will not have a version number and
              this command will print a blank line.

              The <b>db-version </b>command is for standalone and active-backup
              databases only.  For clustered databases, use
              <b>ovsdb-client</b>'s <b>schema-version </b>command instead.

       <b>db-cksum </b>[<i>db</i>]
       <b>schema-cksum </b>[<i>schema</i>]
              Prints the checksum in the schema embedded within the
              database <i>db</i> or of the JSON schema <i>schema</i> on stdout.  If
              <i>schema</i> or <i>db</i> was created before schema checksums were
              introduced, then it will not have a checksum and this
              command will print a blank line.

              The <b>db-cksum </b>command is for standalone and active-backup
              databases only.  For clustered databases, use
              <b>ovsdb-client</b>'s <b>schema-cksum </b>command instead.

       <b>compare-versions </b><i>a op b</i>
              Compares <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> according to <i>op</i>.  Both <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> must be
              OVSDB schema version numbers in the form <i>x</i><b>.</b><i>y</i><b>.</b><i>z</i>, as
              described in <b>ovsdb</b>(7), and <i>op</i> must be one of <b>&lt; &lt;= == &gt;= &gt;</b>
              <b>!=</b>.  If the comparison is true, exits with status 0; if it
              is false, exits with status 2.  (Exit status 1 indicates
              an error, e.g. <i>a</i> or <i>b</i> is the wrong syntax for an OVSDB
              version or <i>op</i> is not a valid comparison operator.)

   <b>Other Commands</b>
       <b>compact </b>[<i>db</i> [<i>target</i>]]
              Reads <i>db</i> and writes a compacted version.  If <i>target</i> is
              specified, the compacted version is written as a new file
              named <i>target</i>, which must not already exist.  If <i>target</i> is
              omitted, then the compacted version of the database
              replaces <i>db</i> in-place.  This command is not needed in
              normal operation because <b>ovsdb-server </b>from time to time
              automatically compacts a database that grows much larger
              than its minimum size.

              This command does not work if <i>db</i> is currently being served
              by <b>ovsdb-server</b>, or if it is otherwise locked for writing
              by another process.  This command also does not work with
              clustered databases.  Instead, in either case, send the
              <b>ovsdb-server/compact </b>command to <b>ovsdb-server</b>, via
              <b>ovs-appctl</b>).

       [<b>--rbac-role=</b><i>role</i>] <b>query </b>[<i>db</i>] <i>transaction</i>
              Opens <i>db</i>, executes <i>transaction</i> on it, and prints the
              results.  The <i>transaction</i> must be a JSON array in the
              format of the <b>params </b>array for the JSON-RPC <b>transact</b>
              method, as described in the OVSDB specification.

              This command opens <i>db</i> for read-only access, so it may
              safely run concurrently with other database activity,
              including <b>ovsdb-server </b>and other database writers.  The
              <i>transaction</i> may specify database modifications, but these
              will have no effect on <i>db</i>.

              By default, the transaction is executed using the
              ``superuser'' RBAC role.  Use <b>--rbac-role </b>to specify a
              different role.

              This command does not work with clustered databases.
              Instead, use <b>ovsdb-client</b>'s <b>query </b>command to send the
              query to <b>ovsdb-server</b>.

       [<b>--rbac-role=</b><i>role</i>] <b>transact </b>[<i>db</i>] <i>transaction</i>
              Opens <i>db</i>, executes <i>transaction</i> on it, prints the results,
              and commits any changes to <i>db</i>.  The <i>transaction</i> must be a
              JSON array in the format of the <b>params </b>array for the JSON-
              RPC <b>transact </b>method, as described in the OVSDB
              specification.

              This command does not work if <i>db</i> is currently being served
              by <b>ovsdb-server</b>, or if it is otherwise locked for writing
              by another process.  This command also does not work with
              clustered databases.  Instead, in either case, use
              <b>ovsdb-client</b>'s <b>transact </b>command to send the query to
              <b>ovsdb-server</b>.

              By default, the transaction is executed using the
              ``superuser'' RBAC role.  Use <b>--rbac-role </b>to specify a
              different role.

       [<b>-m </b>| <b>--more</b>]... <b>show-log </b>[<i>db</i>]
              Prints a summary of the records in <i>db</i>'s log, including the
              time and date at which each database change occurred and
              any associated comment.  This may be useful for debugging.

              To increase the verbosity of output, add <b>-m </b>(or <b>--more</b>)
              one or more times to the command line.  With one <b>-m</b>,
              <b>show-log </b>prints a summary of the records added, deleted,
              or modified by each transaction.  With two <b>-m</b>s, <b>show-log</b>
              also prints the values of the columns modified by each
              change to a record.

              This command works with standalone and active-backup
              databases and with clustered databases, but the output
              formats are different.

       <b>check-cluster </b><i>db</i>...
              Reads all of the records in the supplied databases, which
              must be collected from different servers (and ideally all
              the servers) in a single cluster.  Checks each database
              for self-consistency and the set together for cross-
              consistency.  If <b>ovsdb-tool </b>detects unusual but not
              necessarily incorrect content, it prints a warning or
              warnings on stdout.  If <b>ovsdb-tool </b>find consistency
              errors, it prints an error on stderr and exits with status
              1.  Errors typically indicate bugs in <b>ovsdb-server</b>; please
              consider reporting them to the Open vSwitch developers.

       <b>db-name </b>[<i>db</i>]
       <b>schema-name </b>[<i>schema</i>]
              Prints the name of the schema embedded within the database
              <i>db</i> or in the JSON schema <i>schema</i> on stdout.

       <b>db-cid </b><i>db</i>
              Prints the cluster ID, which is a UUID that identifies the
              cluster, for <i>db</i>.  If <i>db</i> is a database newly created by
              <b>ovsdb-tool cluster-join </b>that has not yet successfully
              joined its cluster, and <b>--cid </b>was not specified on the
              <b>cluster-join </b>command line, then this command will output
              an error, and exit with status 2, because the cluster ID
              is not yet known.  This command works only with clustered
              databases.

              The all-zeros UUID is not a valid cluster ID.

       <b>db-sid </b><i>db</i>
              Prints the server ID, which is a UUID that identifies the
              server, for <i>db</i>.  This command works only with clustered
              databases.  It works even if <i>db</i> is a database newly
              created by <b>ovsdb-tool cluster-join </b>that has not yet
              successfully joined its cluster.

       <b>db-local-address db</b>
              Prints the local address used for database clustering for
              <i>db</i>, in the same <i>protocol</i><b>:</b><i>ip</i><b>:</b><i>port</i> form used on
              <b>create-cluster </b>and <b>join-cluster</b>.

       <b>db-is-clustered </b><i>db</i>
       <b>db-is-standalone </b><i>db</i>
              Tests whether <i>db</i> is a database file in clustered or
              standalone format, respectively.  If so, exits with status
              0; if not, exits with status 2.  (Exit status 1 indicates
              an error, e.g. <i>db</i> is not an OVSDB database or does not
              exist.)
