<pre>
       Import one or more patches from a different branch or a commit
       object into the current series. By default, the name of the
       imported patch is used as the name of the current patch. It can
       be overridden with the <i>--name</i> option. A commit object can be
       reverted with the <i>--revert</i> option. The log and author information
       are those of the commit object.

       When using the <i>--expose</i> option, the format of the commit message
       is determined by the <i>stgit.pick.expose-format</i> configuration
       option. This option is a format string as may supplied as the
       <i>--pretty</i> option to <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/git-show.1.html">git-show(1)</a>. The default is
       "format:%B%n(imported from commit %H)", which appends the commit
       hash of the picked commit to the patchâ€™s commit message.
