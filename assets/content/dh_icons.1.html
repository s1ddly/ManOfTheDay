       <b>dh_icons </b>is a debhelper program that updates caches of
       Freedesktop icons when needed, using the <b>update-icon-caches</b>
       program provided by GTK+2.12.  Currently this program does not
       handle installation of the files, though it may do so at a later
       date, so should be run after icons are installed in the package
       build directories.

       It takes care of adding maintainer script fragments to call
       <b>update-icon-caches </b>for icon directories. (This is not done for
       gnome and hicolor icons, as those are handled by triggers.)
       These commands are inserted into the maintainer scripts by
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dh_installdeb.1.html">dh_installdeb(1)</a>.
