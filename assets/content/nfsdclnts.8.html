       The nfsdclnts(8) command parses the content present in
       /proc/fs/nfsd/clients/ directories. nfsdclnts(8) displays files
       which are open, locked, delegated by the nfs-client. It also
       prints useful client information such as hostname, clientID, NFS
       version mounted by the nfs-client.
