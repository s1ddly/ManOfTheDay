       The program <b>pcp-atop </b>is an interactive monitor to view various
       aspects of load on a system.  It shows the occupation of the most
       critical hardware resources (from a performance point of view) on
       system level, i.e. cpu, memory, disk and network.
       It also shows which processes are responsible for the indicated
       load with respect to cpu and memory load on process level.  Disk
       load is shown per process if "storage accounting" is active in
       the kernel.

       Every <i>interval</i> (default: 10 seconds) information is shown about
       the resource occupation on system level (cpu, memory, disks and
       network layers), followed by a list of processes which have been
       active during the last interval (note that all processes that
       were unchanged during the last interval are not shown, unless the
       key 'a' has been pressed or unless sorting on memory occupation
       is done).  If the list of active processes does not entirely fit
       on the screen, only the top of the list is shown (sorted in order
       of activity).
       The intervals are repeated till the number of <i>samples</i> (specified
       as command argument) is reached, or till the key 'q' is pressed
       in interactive mode.

       When invoked via the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pcp.1.html">pcp(1)</a> command, the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/PCPIntro.1.html">PCPIntro(1)</a> options
       <b>-A</b>/<b>--align</b>, <b>-a</b>/<b>--archive</b>, <b>-h</b>/<b>--host</b>, <b>-O</b>/<b>--origin</b>, <b>-S</b>/<b>--start</b>,
       <b>-s</b>/<b>--samples</b>, <b>-T</b>/<b>--finish</b>, <b>-t</b>/<b>--interval</b>, <b>-v</b>/<b>--version</b>,
       <b>-z</b>/<b>--hostzone </b>and <b>-z</b>/<b>--timezone </b>become indirectly available.
       Additionally, the <b>--hotproc </b>option can be used to request the
       per-process PCP metrics be used instead of the default proc
       metrics from <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmdaproc.1.html">pmdaproc(1)</a>.

       When <b>pcp-atop </b>is started, it checks whether the standard output
       channel is connected to a screen, or to a file/pipe.  In the
       first case it produces screen control codes (via the ncurses
       library) and behaves interactively; in the second case it
       produces flat ASCII-output.

       In interactive mode, the output of <b>pcp-atop </b>scales dynamically to
       the current dimensions of the screen/window.
       If the window is resized horizontally, columns will be added or
       removed automatically. For this purpose, every column has a
       particular weight.  The columns with the highest weights that fit
       within the current width will be shown.
       If the window is resized vertically, lines of the process/thread
       list will be added or removed automatically.

       Furthermore in interactive mode the output of <b>pcp-atop </b>can be
       controlled by pressing particular keys.  However it is also
       possible to specify such key as <b>flag </b>on the command line.  In
       that case <b>pcp-atop </b>switches to the indicated mode on beforehand;
       this mode can be modified again interactively.  Specifying such
       key as flag is especially useful when running <b>pcp-atop </b>with
       output to a pipe or file (non-interactively).  These flags are
       the same as the keys that can be pressed in interactive mode (see
       section INTERACTIVE COMMANDS).
       Additional flags are available to support storage of <b>pcp-atop</b>
       data in PCP archive format (see section PCP DATA STORAGE).
