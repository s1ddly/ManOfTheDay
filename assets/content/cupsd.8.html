       <b>cupsd </b>is the scheduler for CUPS. It implements a printing system
       based upon the Internet Printing Protocol, version 2.1, and
       supports most of the requirements for IPP Everywhere. If no
       options are specified on the command-line then the default
       configuration file <i>/etc/cups/cupsd.conf</i> will be used.
