       A Babeltrace 2 <b>filter.utils.trimmer </b>message iterator discards all
       the consumed messages with a time less than a given beginning
       time and greater than a given end time. It effectively “cuts”, or
       trims trace streams.

       See <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/babeltrace2-intro.7.html">babeltrace2-intro(7)</a> to learn more about the Babeltrace 2
       project and its core concepts.

       A <b>filter.utils.trimmer </b>message iterator makes its upstream
       message iterator seek the configured beginning time (see the
       <b>begin </b>parameter) before it starts to consume messages. This
       seeking operation can have an effect on the times of stream
       beginning, packet beginning, discarded events, and discarded
       packets messages so that they fall within the configured trimming
       time range.

       As such, when a <b>filter.utils.trimmer </b>message iterator consumes a
       message of which the time is greater than the configured end time
       (see the <b>end </b>parameter), it can alter the time of stream end,
       packet end, discarded events, and discarded packets messages so
       that they fall within the configured trimming time range.

       A <b>filter.utils.trimmer </b>message iterator requires that all the
       upstream messages it consumes have times, except for stream
       beginning and end messages, returning an error status otherwise.
