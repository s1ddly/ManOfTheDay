       The <b>taskset </b>command is used to set or retrieve the CPU affinity
       of a running process given its <i>pid</i>, or to launch a new <i>command</i>
       with a given CPU affinity. CPU affinity is a scheduler property
       that "bonds" a process to a given set of CPUs on the system. The
       Linux scheduler will honor the given CPU affinity and the process
       will not run on any other CPUs. Note that the Linux scheduler
       also supports natural CPU affinity: the scheduler attempts to
       keep processes on the same CPU as long as practical for
       performance reasons. Therefore, forcing a specific CPU affinity
       is useful only in certain applications.

       The CPU affinity is represented as a bitmask, with the lowest
       order bit corresponding to the first logical CPU and the highest
       order bit corresponding to the last logical CPU. Not all CPUs may
       exist on a given system but a mask may specify more CPUs than are
       present. A retrieved mask will reflect only the bits that
       correspond to CPUs physically on the system. If an invalid mask
       is given (i.e., one that corresponds to no valid CPUs on the
       current system) an error is returned. The masks may be specified
       in hexadecimal (with or without a leading "0x"), or as a CPU list
       with the <b>--cpu-list </b>option. For example,

       <b>0x00000001</b>
           is processor #0,

       <b>0x00000003</b>
           is processors #0 and #1,

       <b>0xFFFFFFFF</b>
           is processors #0 through #31,

       <b>32</b>
           is processors #1, #4, and #5,

       <b>--cpu-list 0-2,6</b>
           is processors #0, #1, #2, and #6.

       <b>--cpu-list 0-10:2</b>
           is processors #0, #2, #4, #6, #8 and #10. The suffix ":N"
           specifies stride in the range, for example 0-10:3 is
           interpreted as 0,3,6,9 list.

       When <b>taskset </b>returns, it is guaranteed that the given program has
       been scheduled to a legal CPU.
