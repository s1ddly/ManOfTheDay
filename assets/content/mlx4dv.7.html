       The libibverbs API is an abstract one. It is agnostic to any
       underlying provider specific implementation. While this
       abstraction has the advantage of user applications portability it
       has a performance penalty. For some applications optimizing
       performance is more important than portability.

       The mlx4 direct verbs API is intended for such applications.  It
       exposes mlx4 specific low level data path
       (send/receive/completion) operations, allowing the application to
       bypass the libibverbs data path API.

       This interface consists from one hardware specific header file
       with relevant inline functions and conversion logic from ibverbs
       structures to mlx4 specific structures.

       The direct include of mlx4dv.h together with linkage to mlx4
       library will allow usage of this new interface.

       Once an application uses the direct flow the locking scheme is
       fully managed by itself. There is an expectation that no mixed
       flows in the data path for both direct/non-direct access will be
       by same application.
