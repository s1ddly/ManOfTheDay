       <b>pmview </b>is a generalized 3D performance metrics visualization tool
       for the Performance Co-Pilot (<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pcp.1.html">PCP(1)</a>).

       <b>pmview </b>is the base utility behind performance metrics
       visualization tools such as <b>dkvis</b>(1), <b>mpvis</b>(1), <b>osvis</b>(1) and
       <b>nfsvis</b>(1), It is also used by a range of related tools that are
       specific to optional Performance Domain Agents (PMDA) and/or PCP
       add-on products.  <b>pmview </b>may also be used to construct customized
       3D performance displays.

       <b>pmview </b>displays performance metrics as colored blocks and
       cylinders arranged on monochrome base planes. Each object may
       represent a single performance metric, or a stack of several
       performance metrics.  Since the objects are modulated by the
       value of the metric they represent, only numerical metrics may be
       visualized.  Objects representing a single metric may be
       modulated in terms of height, color, or height and color.
       Objects in a stack may only be height modulated, but the stack
       can be normalized to the maximum height.  Labels may be added to
       the scene to help identify groups of metrics.

       A configuration file (as specified by the <b>-c </b>option, or read from
       standard input) is used to specify the position, color, maximum
       value and labels of metrics and metric instances in the scene.
       The maximum value acts as a normalization factor and is used to
       scale the object height and/or color in proportion to the metric
       values.  Metric values which exceed the associated maximum value
       are displayed as solid white objects.  If a metric is
       unavailable, the object will have minimum height and will be
       colored grey.

       Normally, the tool operates in ``live'' mode where performance
       metrics are fetched in real-time.  The user can view metrics from
       any host running <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a>.  <b>pmview </b>can also replay archives of
       performance metrics (see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a>) and allow the user to
       interactively control the current replay time and rate using the
       VCR paradigm.  This is particularly useful for retrospective
       comparisons and for post-mortem analysis of performance problems
       where a remote system is not accessible or a performance analyst
       is not available on-site.

       All metrics in the Performance Metrics Name Space (PMNS) with
       numeric value semantics from any number of hosts or archives may
       be visualized.  <b>pmview </b>examines the semantics of the metrics and
       where sensible, converts metric values to a rate before scaling.
