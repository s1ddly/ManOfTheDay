<pre>
       The <i>find</i> utility shall recursively descend the directory
       hierarchy from each file specified by <i>path</i>, evaluating a Boolean
       expression composed of the primaries described in the OPERANDS
       section for each file encountered. Each <i>path</i> operand shall be
       evaluated unaltered as it was provided, including all trailing
       &lt;slash&gt; characters; all pathnames for other files encountered in
       the hierarchy shall consist of the concatenation of the current
       <i>path</i> operand, a &lt;slash&gt; if the current <i>path</i> operand did not end
       in one, and the filename relative to the <i>path</i> operand. The
       relative portion shall contain no dot or dot-dot components, no
       trailing &lt;slash&gt; characters, and only single &lt;slash&gt; characters
       between pathname components.

       The <i>find</i> utility shall be able to descend to arbitrary depths in
       a file hierarchy and shall not fail due to path length
       limitations (unless a <i>path</i> operand specified by the application
       exceeds {PATH_MAX} requirements).

       The <i>find</i> utility shall detect infinite loops; that is, entering a
       previously visited directory that is an ancestor of the last file
       encountered.  When it detects an infinite loop, <i>find</i> shall write
       a diagnostic message to standard error and shall either recover
       its position in the hierarchy or terminate.

       If a file is removed from or added to the directory hierarchy
       being searched it is unspecified whether or not <i>find</i> includes
       that file in its search.
