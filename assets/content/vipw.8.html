       The <b>vipw </b>and <b>vigr </b>commands edits the files /etc/passwd and
       /etc/group, respectively. With the <b>-s </b>flag, they will edit the
       shadow versions of those files, /etc/shadow and /etc/gshadow,
       respectively. The programs will set the appropriate locks to
       prevent file corruption. When looking for an editor, the programs
       will first try the environment variable <b>$VISUAL</b>, then the
       environment variable <b>$EDITOR</b>, and finally the default editor,
       <b>vi</b>(1).
