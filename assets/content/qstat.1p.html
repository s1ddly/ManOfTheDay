       The status of a batch job, batch queue, or batch server is
       obtained by a request to the server. The <i>qstat</i> utility is a user-
       accessible batch client that requests the status of one or more
       batch jobs, batch queues, or servers, and writes the status
       information to standard output.

       For each successfully processed batch <i>job_identifier</i>, the <i>qstat</i>
       utility shall display information about the corresponding batch
       job.

       For each successfully processed destination, the <i>qstat</i> utility
       shall display information about the corresponding batch queue.

       For each successfully processed server name, the <i>qstat</i> utility
       shall display information about the corresponding server.

       The <i>qstat</i> utility shall acquire batch job status information by
       sending a <i>Job Status Request</i> to a batch server. The <i>qstat</i> utility
       shall acquire batch queue status information by sending a <i>Queue</i>
       <i>Status Request</i> to a batch server. The <i>qstat</i> utility shall acquire
       server status information by sending a <i>Server Status Request</i> to a
       batch server.
