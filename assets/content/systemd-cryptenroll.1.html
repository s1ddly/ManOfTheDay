       <b>systemd-cryptenroll </b>is a tool for enrolling hardware security
       tokens and devices into a LUKS2 encrypted volume, which may then
       be used to unlock the volume during boot. Specifically, it
       supports tokens and credentials of the following kind to be
       enrolled:

        1. PKCS#11 security tokens and smartcards that may carry an RSA
           key pair (e.g. various YubiKeys)

        2. FIDO2 security tokens that implement the "hmac-secret"
           extension (most FIDO2 keys, including YubiKeys)

        3. TPM2 security devices

        4. Recovery keys. These are similar to regular passphrases,
           however are randomly generated on the computer and thus
           generally have higher entropy than user chosen passphrases.
           Their character set has been designed to ensure they are easy
           to type in, while having high entropy. They may also be
           scanned off screen using QR codes. Recovery keys may be used
           for unlocking LUKS2 volumes wherever passphrases are
           accepted. They are intended to be used in combination with an
           enrolled hardware security token, as a recovery option when
           the token is lost.

        5. Regular passphrases

       In addition, the tool may be used to enumerate currently enrolled
       security tokens and wipe a subset of them. The latter may be
       combined with the enrollment operation of a new security token,
       in order to update or replace enrollments.

       The tool supports only LUKS2 volumes, as it stores token
       meta-information in the LUKS2 JSON token area, which is not
       available in other encryption formats.
