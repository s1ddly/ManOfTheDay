       <b>gencfu </b>reads confusable character definitions in the input file,
       which are plain text files containing confusable character
       definitions in the input format defined by Unicode UAX39 for the
       files <i>confusables.txt</i> and <i>confusablesWholeScript.txt.</i>  This
       source (.txt) format is also accepted by ICU spoof detectors.
       The files must be encoded in utf-8 format, with or without a BOM.
       Normally the output data file has the <b>.cfu </b>extension.
