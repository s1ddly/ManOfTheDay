<pre>
       The GNU implemenation of <i>eqn</i> is part of the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/groff.7.html">groff(7)</a> document
       formatting system.  <i>eqn</i> is a <i>troff</i>(1) preprocessor that
       translates descriptions of equations embedded in <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/roff.7.html">roff(7)</a> input
       files into the language understood by <i>troff</i>(1).  It copies the
       contents of each <i>file</i> to the standard output stream, except that
       lines between <b>.EQ </b>and <b>.EN </b>(or “inline” within a pair of user-
       specified delimiters) are interpreted as equation descriptions.
       Normally, <i>eqn</i> is not executed directly by the user, but invoked
       by specifying the <b>-e </b>option to <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/groff.1.html">groff(1)</a>.  While GNU <i>eqn</i>'s input
       syntax is highly compatible with AT&amp;T <i>eqn</i>, the output <i>eqn</i>
       produces cannot be processed by AT&amp;T <i>troff</i>; GNU <i>troff</i> (or a <i>troff</i>
       implementing relevant GNU extensions) must be used.  If no <i>file</i>
       operands are given on the command line, or if <i>file</i> is “<b>-</b>”, the
       standard input stream is read.

       Unless the <b>-R </b>option is given, <i>eqn</i> searches for the file <i>eqnrc</i> in
       the directories given with the <b>-M </b>option first, then in <i>/usr/</i>
       <i>local/lib/groff/site-tmac</i>, <i>/usr/local/share/groff/site-tmac</i>, and
       finally in the standard macro directory <i>/usr/local/share/groff/</i>
       <i>1.23.0/tmac</i>.  If it exists, <i>eqn</i> processes it before the other
       input files.

       Only the differences between GNU <i>eqn</i> and AT&amp;T <i>eqn</i> are described
       in this document.  Most of the new features of the GNU <i>eqn</i> input
       language are based on TeX.  There are some references to the
       differences between TeX and GNU <i>eqn</i> below; these may safely be
       ignored if you do not know TeX.

       Three points are worth special note.

       •      GNU <i>eqn</i> emits Presentation MathML output when invoked with
              the “<b>-T MathML</b>” option.

       •      GNU <i>eqn</i> does not provide the functionality of <i>neqn</i>: it
              does not support low-resolution, typewriter-like devices
              (although it may work adequately for very simple input).

       •      GNU <i>eqn</i> sets the input token “<b>...</b>” as three periods or low
              dots, rather than the three centered dots of AT&amp;T <i>eqn</i>.  To
              get three centered dots, write <b>cdots </b>or “<b>cdot cdot cdot</b>”.

   <b>Controlling delimiters</b>
       If not in compatibility mode, <i>eqn</i> recognizes
              delim on
       as a command to restore the delimiters which have been previously
       disabled with a call to “<b>delim off</b>”.  If delimiters haven't been
       specified, the call has no effect.

   <b>Automatic spacing</b>
       <i>eqn</i> gives each component of an equation a type, and adjusts the
       spacing between components using that type.  Possible types are
       described in the table below.

              ordinary      an ordinary character such as “1” or “<i>x</i>”
              operator      a large operator such as “Σ”
              binary        a binary operator such as “+”
              relation      a relation such as “=”
              opening       an opening bracket such as “(”
              closing       a closing bracket such as “)”
              punctuation   a punctuation character such as “,”
              inner         a sub-formula contained within brackets
              suppress      a type without automatic spacing adjustment

       Components of an equation get a type in one of two ways.

       <b>type </b><i>t e</i>
              This yields an equation component that contains <i>e</i> but that
              has type <i>t</i>, where <i>t</i> is one of the types mentioned above.
              For example, <b>times </b>is defined as follows.

                     type "binary" \(mu

              The name of the type doesn't have to be quoted, but
              quoting it protects it from macro expansion.

       <b>chartype </b><i>t text</i>
              Each (unquoted) character in <i>text</i> is assigned type <i>t</i>.  The
              type <i>t</i> can also be “<b>letter</b>” or “<b>digit</b>”; in these cases
              <b>chartype </b>changes the font style of the characters.  See
              subsection “Fonts” below.  For example,

                     chartype "punctuation" .,;:

              assigns the “<b>punctuation</b>” type to each of the characters
              in “.,;:” wherever they subsequently appear in an
              equation.

   <b>New primitives</b>
       <b>big </b><i>e</i>  Enlarges the expression it modifies; intended to have
              semantics like CSS “large”.  In <i>troff</i> output, the point
              size is increased by 5; in MathML output, the expression
              uses

                     &lt;mstyle mathsize='big'&gt;

       <i>e1</i> <b>smallover </b><i>e2</i>
              This is similar to <b>over</b>; <b>smallover </b>reduces the size of <i>e1</i>
              and <i>e2</i>; it also puts less vertical space between <i>e1</i> or <i>e2</i>
              and the fraction bar.  The <b>over </b>primitive corresponds to
              the TeX <b>\over </b>primitive in display styles; <b>smallover</b>
              corresponds to <b>\over </b>in non-display styles.

       <b>vcenter </b><i>e</i>
              This vertically centers <i>e</i> about the math axis.  The math
              axis is the vertical position about which characters such
              as “+” and “−” are centered; it is also the vertical
              position used for fraction bars.  For example, <b>sum </b>is
              defined as follows.

                     { type "operator" vcenter size +5 \(*S }

              <b>vcenter </b>is silently ignored when generating MathML.

       <i>e1</i> <b>accent </b><i>e2</i>
              This sets <i>e2</i> as an accent over <i>e1</i>.  <i>e2</i> is assumed to be at
              the correct height for a lowercase letter; <i>e2</i> is moved
              down according to whether <i>e1</i> is taller or shorter than a
              lowercase letter.  For example, <b>hat </b>is defined as follows.

                     accent { "^" }

              <b>dotdot</b>, <b>dot</b>, <b>tilde</b>, <b>vec</b>, and <b>dyad </b>are also defined using
              the <b>accent </b>primitive.

       <i>e1</i> <b>uaccent </b><i>e2</i>
              This sets <i>e2</i> as an accent under <i>e1</i>.  <i>e2</i> is assumed to be
              at the correct height for a character without a descender;
              <i>e2</i> is moved down if <i>e1</i> has a descender.  <b>utilde </b>is pre-
              defined using <b>uaccent </b>as a tilde accent below the
              baseline.

       <b>split "</b><i>text</i><b>"</b>
              This has the same effect as simply

                     <i>text</i>

              but <i>text</i> is not subject to macro expansion because it is
              quoted; <i>text</i> is split up and the spacing between
              individual characters is adjusted.

       <b>nosplit </b><i>text</i>
              This has the same effect as

                     "<i>text</i>"

              but because <i>text</i> is not quoted it is subject to macro
              expansion; <i>text</i> is not split up and the spacing between
              individual characters is not adjusted.

       <i>e</i> <b>opprime</b>
              This is a variant of <b>prime </b>that acts as an operator on <i>e</i>.
              It produces a different result from <b>prime </b>in a case such
              as “<b>A opprime sub 1</b>”: with <b>opprime </b>the “1” is tucked under
              the prime as a subscript to the “A” (as is conventional in
              mathematical typesetting), whereas with <b>prime </b>the “1” is a
              subscript to the prime character.  The precedence of
              <b>opprime </b>is the same as that of <b>bar </b>and <b>under</b>, which is
              higher than that of everything except <b>accent </b>and <b>uaccent</b>.
              In unquoted text, a neutral apostrophe (<b>'</b>) that is not the
              first character on the input line is treated like <b>opprime</b>.

       <b>special </b><i>text e</i>
              This constructs a new object from <i>e</i> using a <i>troff</i>(1) macro
              named <i>text</i>.  When the macro is called, the string <b>0s</b>
              contains the output for <i>e</i>, and the number registers <b>0w</b>,
              <b>0h</b>, <b>0d</b>, <b>0skern</b>, and <b>0skew </b>contain the width, height,
              depth, subscript kern, and skew of <i>e</i>.  (The <i>subscript kern</i>
              of an object indicates how much a subscript on that object
              should be “tucked in”, or placed to the left relative to a
              non-subscripted glyph of the same size.  The <i>skew</i> of an
              object is how far to the right of the center of the object
              an accent over it should be placed.)  The macro must
              modify <b>0s </b>so that it outputs the desired result with its
              origin at the current point, and increase the current
              horizontal position by the width of the object.  The
              number registers must also be modified so that they
              correspond to the result.

              For example, suppose you wanted a construct that “cancels”
              an expression by drawing a diagonal line through it.

                     .EQ
                     define cancel 'special Ca'
                     .EN
                     .de Ca
                     .  ds 0s \
                     \Z'\\*(0s'\
                     \v'\\n(0du'\
                     \D'l \\n(0wu -\\n(0hu-\\n(0du'\
                     \v'\\n(0hu'
                     ..

              You could then cancel an expression <i>e</i> with “<b>cancel { </b><i>e</i> <b>}</b>”.

              Here's a more complicated construct that draws a box
              around an expression.

                     .EQ
                     define box 'special Bx'
                     .EN
                     .de Bx
                     .ds 0s \
                     \Z'\h'1n'\\*(0s'\
                     \Z'\
                     \v'\\n(0du+1n'\
                     \D'l \\n(0wu+2n 0'\
                     \D'l 0 -\\n(0hu-\\n(0du-2n'\
                     \D'l -\\n(0wu-2n 0'\
                     \D'l 0 \\n(0hu+\\n(0du+2n'\
                     '\
                     \h'\\n(0wu+2n'
                     .nr 0w +2n
                     .nr 0d +1n
                     .nr 0h +1n
                     ..

       <b>space </b><i>n</i>
              A positive value of the integer <i>n</i> (in hundredths of an em)
              sets the vertical spacing before the equation, a negative
              value sets the spacing after the equation, replacing the
              default values.  This primitive provides an interface to
              <i>groff</i>'s <b>\x </b>escape (but with opposite sign).  This keyword
              has no effect if the equation is part of a <i>pic</i> picture.

   <b>Extended primitives</b>
       <b>col </b><i>n</i> <b>{ </b>... <b>}</b>
       <b>ccol </b><i>n</i> <b>{ </b>... <b>}</b>
       <b>lcol </b><i>n</i> <b>{ </b>... <b>}</b>
       <b>rcol </b><i>n</i> <b>{ </b>... <b>}</b>
       <b>pile </b><i>n</i> <b>{ </b>... <b>}</b>
       <b>cpile </b><i>n</i> <b>{ </b>... <b>}</b>
       <b>lpile </b><i>n</i> <b>{ </b>... <b>}</b>
       <b>rpile </b><i>n</i> <b>{ </b>... <b>}</b>
              The integer value <i>n</i> (in hundredths of an em) increases the
              vertical spacing between rows, using <i>groff</i>'s <b>\x </b>escape
              (the value has no effect in MathML mode).  Negative values
              are possible but have no effect.  If there is more than a
              single value given in a matrix, the biggest one is used.

   <b>Customization</b>
       When <i>eqn</i> is generating <i>troff</i> markup, the appearance of equations
       is controlled by a large number of parameters.  They have no
       effect when generating MathML mode, which pushes typesetting and
       fine motions downstream to a MathML rendering engine.  These
       parameters can be set using the <b>set </b>command.

       <b>set </b><i>p n</i>
              This sets parameter <i>p</i> to value <i>n</i>, where <i>n</i> is an integer.
              For example,

                     set x_height 45

              says that <i>eqn</i> should assume an x height of 0.45 ems.

              Possible parameters are as follows.  Values are in units
              of hundredths of an em unless otherwise stated.  These
              descriptions are intended to be expository rather than
              definitive.

              <b>minimum_size</b>
                     <i>eqn</i> won't set anything at a smaller point size than
                     this.  The value is in points.

              <b>fat_offset</b>
                     The <b>fat </b>primitive emboldens an equation by
                     overprinting two copies of the equation
                     horizontally offset by this amount.  This parameter
                     is not used in MathML mode; fat text uses
                            &lt;mstyle mathvariant='double-struck'&gt;
                     instead.

              <b>over_hang</b>
                     A fraction bar is longer by twice this amount than
                     the maximum of the widths of the numerator and
                     denominator; in other words, it overhangs the
                     numerator and denominator by at least this amount.

              <b>accent_width</b>
                     When <b>bar </b>or <b>under </b>is applied to a single character,
                     the line is this long.  Normally, <b>bar </b>or <b>under</b>
                     produces a line whose length is the width of the
                     object to which it applies; in the case of a single
                     character, this tends to produce a line that looks
                     too long.

              <b>delimiter_factor</b>
                     Extensible delimiters produced with the <b>left </b>and
                     <b>right </b>primitives have a combined height and depth
                     of at least this many thousandths of twice the
                     maximum amount by which the sub-equation that the
                     delimiters enclose extends away from the axis.

              <b>delimiter_shortfall</b>
                     Extensible delimiters produced with the <b>left </b>and
                     <b>right </b>primitives have a combined height and depth
                     not less than the difference of twice the maximum
                     amount by which the sub-equation that the
                     delimiters enclose extends away from the axis and
                     this amount.

              <b>null_delimiter_space</b>
                     This much horizontal space is inserted on each side
                     of a fraction.

              <b>script_space</b>
                     The width of subscripts and superscripts is
                     increased by this amount.

              <b>thin_space</b>
                     This amount of space is automatically inserted
                     after punctuation characters.

              <b>medium_space</b>
                     This amount of space is automatically inserted on
                     either side of binary operators.

              <b>thick_space</b>
                     This amount of space is automatically inserted on
                     either side of relations.

              <b>x_height</b>
                     The height of lowercase letters without ascenders
                     such as “x”.

              <b>axis_height</b>
                     The height above the baseline of the center of
                     characters such as “+” and “−”.  It is important
                     that this value is correct for the font you are
                     using.

              <b>default_rule_thickness</b>
                     This should be set to the thickness of the <b>\[ru]</b>
                     character, or the thickness of horizontal lines
                     produced with the <b>\D </b>escape sequence.

              <b>num1   </b>The <b>over </b>command shifts up the numerator by at
                     least this amount.

              <b>num2   </b>The <b>smallover </b>command shifts up the numerator by at
                     least this amount.

              <b>denom1 </b>The <b>over </b>command shifts down the denominator by at
                     least this amount.

              <b>denom2 </b>The <b>smallover </b>command shifts down the denominator
                     by at least this amount.

              <b>sup1   </b>Normally superscripts are shifted up by at least
                     this amount.

              <b>sup2   </b>Superscripts within superscripts or upper limits or
                     numerators of <b>smallover </b>fractions are shifted up by
                     at least this amount.  This is usually less than
                     <b>sup1</b>.

              <b>sup3   </b>Superscripts within denominators or square roots or
                     subscripts or lower limits are shifted up by at
                     least this amount.  This is usually less than <b>sup2</b>.

              <b>sub1   </b>Subscripts are normally shifted down by at least
                     this amount.

              <b>sub2   </b>When there is both a subscript and a superscript,
                     the subscript is shifted down by at least this
                     amount.

              <b>sup_drop</b>
                     The baseline of a superscript is no more than this
                     much below the top of the object on which the
                     superscript is set.

              <b>sub_drop</b>
                     The baseline of a subscript is at least this much
                     below the bottom of the object on which the
                     subscript is set.

              <b>big_op_spacing1</b>
                     The baseline of an upper limit is at least this
                     much above the top of the object on which the limit
                     is set.

              <b>big_op_spacing2</b>
                     The baseline of a lower limit is at least this much
                     below the bottom of the object on which the limit
                     is set.

              <b>big_op_spacing3</b>
                     The bottom of an upper limit is at least this much
                     above the top of the object on which the limit is
                     set.

              <b>big_op_spacing4</b>
                     The top of a lower limit is at least this much
                     below the bottom of the object on which the limit
                     is set.

              <b>big_op_spacing5</b>
                     This much vertical space is added above and below
                     limits.

              <b>baseline_sep</b>
                     The baselines of the rows in a pile or matrix are
                     normally this far apart.  In most cases this should
                     be equal to the sum of <b>num1 </b>and <b>denom1</b>.

              <b>shift_down</b>
                     The midpoint between the top baseline and the
                     bottom baseline in a matrix or pile is shifted down
                     by this much from the axis.  In most cases this
                     should be equal to <b>axis_height</b>.

              <b>column_sep</b>
                     This much space is added between columns in a
                     matrix.

              <b>matrix_side_sep</b>
                     This much space is added at each side of a matrix.

              <b>draw_lines</b>
                     If this is non-zero, lines are drawn using the <b>\D</b>
                     escape sequence, rather than with the <b>\l </b>escape
                     sequence and the <b>\[ru] </b>character.

              <b>body_height</b>
                     The amount by which the height of the equation
                     exceeds this is added as extra space before the
                     line containing the equation (using <b>\x</b>).  The
                     default value is 85.

              <b>body_depth</b>
                     The amount by which the depth of the equation
                     exceeds this is added as extra space after the line
                     containing the equation (using <b>\x</b>).  The default
                     value is 35.

              <b>nroff  </b>If this is non-zero, then <b>ndefine </b>behaves like
                     <b>define </b>and <b>tdefine </b>is ignored, otherwise <b>tdefine</b>
                     behaves like <b>define </b>and <b>ndefine </b>is ignored.  The
                     default value is 0.  (This is typically changed
                     to 1 by the <i>eqnrc</i> file for the <b>ascii</b>, <b>latin1</b>, <b>utf8</b>,
                     and <b>cp1047 </b>drivers.)

              A more precise description of the role of many of these
              parameters can be found in Appendix H of <i>The TeXbook</i>.

   <b>Macros</b>
       Macros can take arguments.  In a macro body, <b>$</b><i>n</i> where <i>n</i> is
       between 1 and 9, is replaced by the <i>n</i>th argument if the macro is
       called with arguments; if there are fewer than <i>n</i> arguments, it is
       replaced by nothing.  A word containing a left parenthesis where
       the part of the word before the left parenthesis has been defined
       using the <b>define </b>command is recognized as a macro call with
       arguments; characters following the left parenthesis up to a
       matching right parenthesis are treated as comma-separated
       arguments.  Commas inside nested parentheses do not terminate an
       argument.

       <b>sdefine </b><i>name X anything X</i>
              This is like the <b>define </b>command, but <i>name</i> is not
              recognized if called with arguments.

       <b>include "</b><i>file</i><b>"</b>
       <b>copy "</b><i>file</i><b>"</b>
              Include the contents of <i>file</i> (<b>include </b>and <b>copy </b>are
              synonyms).  Lines of <i>file</i> beginning with <b>.EQ </b>or <b>.EN </b>are
              ignored.

       <b>ifdef </b><i>name X anything X</i>
              If <i>name</i> has been defined by <b>define </b>(or has been
              automatically defined because <i>name</i> is the output driver)
              process <i>anything</i>; otherwise ignore <i>anything</i>.  <i>X</i> can be any
              character not appearing in <i>anything</i>.

       <b>undef </b><i>name</i>
              Remove definition of <i>name</i>, making it undefined.

       Besides the macros mentioned above, the following definitions are
       available: <b>Alpha</b>, <b>Beta</b>, ..., <b>Omega </b>(this is the same as <b>ALPHA</b>,
       <b>BETA</b>, ..., <b>OMEGA</b>), <b>ldots </b>(three dots on the baseline), and
       <b>dollar</b>.

   <b>Fonts</b>
       <i>eqn</i> normally uses at least two fonts to set an equation: an
       italic font for letters, and a roman font for everything else.
       The AT&amp;T <i>eqn</i> <b>gfont </b>command changes the font that is used as the
       italic font.  By default this is <b>I</b>.  The font that is used as the
       roman font can be changed using the new <b>grfont </b>command.

       <b>grfont </b><i>f</i>
              Set the roman font to <i>f</i>.

       The <b>italic </b>primitive uses the current italic font set by <b>gfont</b>;
       the <b>roman </b>primitive uses the current roman font set by <b>grfont</b>.
       There is also a new <b>gbfont </b>command, which changes the font used
       by the <b>bold </b>primitive.  If you only use the <b>roman</b>, <b>italic </b>and
       <b>bold </b>primitives to changes fonts within an equation, you can
       change all the fonts used by your equations just by using <b>gfont</b>,
       <b>grfont </b>and <b>gbfont </b>commands.

       You can control which characters are treated as letters (and
       therefore set in italics) by using the <b>chartype </b>command described
       above.  A type of <b>letter </b>causes a character to be set in italic
       type.  A type of <b>digit </b>causes a character to be set in roman
       type.
