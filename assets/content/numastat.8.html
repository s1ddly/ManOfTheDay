       <b>numastat </b>with no command options or arguments at all, displays
       per-node NUMA hit and miss system statistics from the kernel
       memory allocator.  This default <b>numastat </b>behavior is strictly
       compatible with the previous long-standing <b>numastat </b>perl script,
       written by Andi Kleen.  The default <b>numastat </b>statistics shows
       per-node numbers (in units of pages of memory) in these
       categories:

       <b>numa_hit </b>is memory successfully allocated on this node as
       intended.

       <b>numa_miss </b>is memory allocated on this node despite the process
       preferring some different node. Each <i>numa_miss</i> has a <i>numa_foreign</i>
       on another node.

       <b>numa_foreign </b>is memory intended for this node, but actually
       allocated on some different node.  Each <i>numa_foreign</i> has a
       <i>numa_miss</i> on another node.

       <b>interleave_hit </b>is interleaved memory successfully allocated on
       this node as intended.

       <b>local_node </b>is memory allocated on this node while a process was
       running on it.

       <b>other_node </b>is memory allocated on this node while a process was
       running on some other node.

       Any supplied options or arguments with the <b>numastat </b>command will
       significantly change both the content and the format of the
       display.  Specified options will cause display units to change to
       megabytes of memory, and will change other specific behaviors of
       <b>numastat </b>as described below.

       Memory usage information reflects the resident pages on the
       system.
