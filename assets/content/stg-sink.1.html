       This is the opposite operation of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/stg-float.1.html">stg-float(1)</a>: move the
       specified patches down the stack. It is for example useful to
       group stable patches near the bottom of the stack, where they are
       less likely to be impacted by the push of another patch, and from
       where they can be more easily committed or pushed.

       If no patch is specified on command-line, the current patch gets
       sunk. By default patches are sunk to the bottom of the stack, but
       the <i>--to</i> option allows one to place them under any applied patch.

       Sinking internally involves popping all patches (or all patches
       including &lt;target patch&gt;), then pushing the patches to sink, and
       then (unless <i>--nopush</i> is also given) pushing back into place the
       formerly-applied patches.
