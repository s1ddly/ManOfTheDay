       <b>zsoelim </b>parses <i>file</i> arguments, or if none are specified, its
       standard input for lines of the form:

       <b>.so </b>&lt;<i>filename</i>&gt;

       These requests are replaced by the contents of the <i>filename</i>
       specified.  If the request cannot be met, <b>zsoelim </b>looks for
       <i>filename.ext</i> where <i>.ext</i> can be one of <b>.gz</b>, <b>.Z </b>or <b>.z</b>.  Other
       extension types may be supported depending upon compile time
       options.  If the request can be met by a compressed file, this
       file is decompressed using an appropriate decompressor and its
       output is used to satisfy the request.

       Traditionally, <b>soelim </b>programs were used to allow roff
       preprocessors to be able to preprocess the files referred to by
       the requests.  This particular version was written to circumvent
       problems created by support for compressed manual pages.
