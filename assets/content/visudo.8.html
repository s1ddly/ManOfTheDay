     <b>visudo </b>edits the <i>sudoers</i> file in a safe fashion, analogous to
     vipw(8).  <b>visudo </b>locks the <i>sudoers</i> file against multiple
     simultaneous edits, performs basic validity checks, and checks for
     syntax errors before installing the edited file.  If the <i>sudoers</i>
     file is currently being edited you will receive a message to try
     again later.

     <b>visudo </b>parses the <i>sudoers</i> file after editing and will not save the
     changes if there is a syntax error.  Upon finding an error, <b>visudo</b>
     will print a message stating the line number(s) where the error
     occurred and the user will receive the “What now?” prompt.  At this
     point the user may enter ‘e’ to re-edit the <i>sudoers</i> file, ‘x’ to
     exit without saving the changes, or ‘Q’ to quit and save changes.
     The ‘Q’ option should be used with extreme caution because if
     <b>visudo </b>believes there to be a syntax error, so will <b>sudo </b>and no one
     will be able to run <b>sudo </b>again until the error is fixed.  If ‘e’ is
     typed to edit the <i>sudoers</i> file after a syntax error has been
     detected, the cursor will be placed on the line where the error
     occurred (if the editor supports this feature).

     There are two <i>sudoers</i> settings that determine which editor <b>visudo</b>
     will run.

     editor    A colon (‘:’) separated list of editors allowed to be
               used with <b>visudo</b>.  <b>visudo </b>will choose the editor that
               matches the user's SUDO_EDITOR, VISUAL or EDITOR
               environment variable if possible, or the first editor in
               the list that exists and is executable.  Note that <b>sudo</b>
               does not preserve the SUDO_EDITOR, VISUAL or EDITOR
               environment variables unless they are present in the
               <i>env_keep</i> list or the <i>env_reset</i> option is disabled in the
               <i>sudoers</i> file.  The default editor path is <i>/usr/bin/vi</i>
               which can be set at compile time via the --with-editor
               configure option.

     env_editor
               If set, <b>visudo </b>will use the value of the SUDO_EDITOR,
               VISUAL or EDITOR environment variables before falling
               back on the default editor list.  Note that <b>visudo </b>is
               typically run as root so this option may allow a user
               with <b>visudo </b>privileges to run arbitrary commands as root
               without logging.  An alternative is to place a colon-
               separated list of “safe” editors int the <i>editor</i> variable.
               <b>visudo </b>will then only use SUDO_EDITOR, VISUAL or EDITOR
               if they match a value specified in <i>editor</i>.  If the
               <i>env_reset</i> flag is enabled, the SUDO_EDITOR, VISUAL and/or
               EDITOR environment variables must be present in the
               <i>env_keep</i> list for the <i>env_editor</i> flag to function when
               <b>visudo </b>is invoked via <b>sudo</b>.  The default value is <i>on</i>,
               which can be set at compile time via the
               --with-env-editor configure option.

     The options are as follows:

     <b>-c</b>, <b>--check</b>
                 Enable <i>check-only</i> mode.  The existing <i>sudoers</i> file (and
                 any other files it includes) will be checked for syntax
                 errors.  If the path to the <i>sudoers</i> file was not
                 specified, <b>visudo </b>will also check the file owner and
                 mode.  A message will be printed to the standard output
                 describing the status of <i>sudoers</i> unless the <b>-q </b>option
                 was specified.  If the check completes successfully,
                 <b>visudo </b>will exit with a value of 0.  If an error is
                 encountered, <b>visudo </b>will exit with a value of 1.

     <b>-f </b><i>sudoers</i>, <b>--file</b>=<i>sudoers</i>
                 Specify an alternate <i>sudoers</i> file location, see below.
                 As of version 1.8.27, the <i>sudoers</i> path can be specified
                 without using the <b>-f </b>option.

     <b>-h</b>, <b>--help  </b>Display a short help message to the standard output and
                 exit.

     <b>-q</b>, <b>--quiet</b>
                 Enable <i>quiet</i> mode.  In this mode details about syntax
                 errors are not printed.  This option is only useful
                 when combined with the <b>-c </b>option.

     <b>-s</b>, <b>--strict</b>
                 Enable <i>strict</i> checking of the <i>sudoers</i> file.  If an
                 alias is referenced but not actually defined or if
                 there is a cycle in an alias, <b>visudo </b>will consider this
                 a syntax error.  Note that it is not possible to
                 differentiate between an alias and a host name or user
                 name that consists solely of uppercase letters, digits,
                 and the underscore (‘_’) character.

     <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
                 Print the <b>visudo </b>and <i>sudoers</i> grammar versions and exit.

     A <i>sudoers</i> file may be specified instead of the default,
     <i>/etc/sudoers</i>.  The temporary file used is the specified <i>sudoers</i>
     file with “.tmp” appended to it.  In <i>check-only</i> mode only, ‘-’ may
     be used to indicate that <i>sudoers</i> will be read from the standard
     input.  Because the policy is evaluated in its entirety, it is not
     sufficient to check an individual <i>sudoers</i> include file for syntax
     errors.

   <b>Debugging and sudoers plugin arguments</b>
     <b>visudo </b>versions 1.8.4 and higher support a flexible debugging
     framework that is configured via Debug lines in the sudo.conf(5)
     file.

     Starting with <b>sudo </b>1.8.12, <b>visudo </b>will also parse the arguments to
     the <i>sudoers</i> plugin to override the default <i>sudoers</i> path name, UID,
     GID and file mode.  These arguments, if present, should be listed
     after the path to the plugin (i.e., after <i>sudoers.so</i>).  Multiple
     arguments may be specified, separated by white space.  For example:

           Plugin sudoers_policy sudoers.so sudoers_mode=0400

     The following arguments are supported:

     sudoers_file=pathname
               The <i>sudoers_file</i> argument can be used to override the
               default path to the <i>sudoers</i> file.

     sudoers_uid=uid
               The <i>sudoers_uid</i> argument can be used to override the
               default owner of the sudoers file.  It should be
               specified as a numeric user-ID.

     sudoers_gid=gid
               The <i>sudoers_gid</i> argument can be used to override the
               default group of the sudoers file.  It must be specified
               as a numeric group-ID (not a group name).

     sudoers_mode=mode
               The <i>sudoers_mode</i> argument can be used to override the
               default file mode for the sudoers file.  It should be
               specified as an octal value.

     For more information on configuring sudo.conf(5), please refer to
     its manual.
