       <b>pmlogger_rewrite </b>is a helper script that is used by
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmlogger_daily.1.html">pmlogger_daily(1)</a> when rewriting Performance Co-Pilot (PCP)
       archives.  Rewriting is usually required to accommodate
       evolutionary changes in metadata so old archives can be updated
       and then merged with current archives.

       <b>pmlogger_rewrite </b>is a wrapper script for <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmlogrewrite.1.html">pmlogrewrite(1)</a> that
       will potentially rewrite all of the archive logs matching the
       <i>archive</i> arguments.  Each <i>archive</i> argument may be a PCP archive
       file name, the basename for the files in a PCP archive, or a
       directory (in which case all subordinate PCP archives are found
       by recursive descent).

       <b>pmlogrewrite </b>is run with the <b>-i </b>option so rewriting is done ``in
       place''.  The <b>-q </b>option is also used, so if no rewriting is
       required then no changes are made to the archive files.
