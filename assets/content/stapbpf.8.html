       The <i>stapbpf</i> program is the BPF back-end of the Systemtap tool.
       It expects a bpf-elf file produced by the front-end <i>stap</i> tool,
       when run with <i>--runtime=bpf</i>.

       Splitting the systemtap tool into a front-end and a back-end
       allows a user to compile a systemtap script on a development
       machine that has the debugging information needed to compile the
       script and then transfer the resulting shared object to a
       production machine that doesn't have any development tools or
       debugging information installed.

       Please refer to <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/stappaths.7.html">stappaths(7)</a> for the version number, or run

        $ rpm -q systemtap # (for Fedora/RHEL)
        $ apt-get -v systemtap # (for Ubuntu)
