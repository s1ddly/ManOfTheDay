<pre>
       Print or check SHA256 (256-bit) checksums.

       With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.

       <b>-b</b>, <b>--binary</b>
              read in binary mode

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--check</b>
              read SHA256 sums from the FILEs and check them

       <b>--tag  </b>create a BSD-style checksum

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--text</b>
              read in text mode (default)

       <b>-z</b>, <b>--zero</b>
              end each output line with NUL, not newline, and disable
              file name escaping

   <b>The following five options are useful only when verifying checksums:</b>
       <b>--ignore-missing</b>
              don't fail or report status for missing files

       <b>--quiet</b>
              don't print OK for each successfully verified file

       <b>--status</b>
              don't output anything, status code shows success

       <b>--strict</b>
              exit non-zero for improperly formatted checksum lines

       <b>-w</b>, <b>--warn</b>
              warn about improperly formatted checksum lines

       <b>--help </b>display this help and exit

       <b>--version</b>
              output version information and exit

       The sums are computed as described in FIPS-180-2.  When checking,
       the input should be a former output of this program.  The default
       mode is to print a line with checksum, a space, a character
       indicating input mode ('*' for binary, ' ' for text or where
       binary is insignificant), and name for each FILE.

       Note: There is no difference between binary mode and text mode on
       GNU systems.
