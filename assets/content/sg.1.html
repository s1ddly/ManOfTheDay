       The <b>sg </b>command works similar to <b>newgrp </b>but accepts a command. The
       command will be executed with the /bin/sh shell. With most shells
       you may run <b>sg </b>from, you need to enclose multi-word commands in
       quotes. Another difference between <b>newgrp </b>and <b>sg </b>is that some
       shells treat <b>newgrp </b>specially, replacing themselves with a new
       instance of a shell that <b>newgrp </b>creates. This doesn't happen with
       <b>sg</b>, so upon exit from a <b>sg </b>command you are returned to your
       previous group ID.
