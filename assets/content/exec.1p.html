       The <i>exec</i> utility shall open, close, and/or copy file descriptors
       as specified by any redirections as part of the command.

       If <i>exec</i> is specified without <i>command</i> or <i>argument</i>s, and any file
       descriptors with numbers greater than 2 are opened with
       associated redirection statements, it is unspecified whether
       those file descriptors remain open when the shell invokes another
       utility.  Scripts concerned that child shells could misuse open
       file descriptors can always close them explicitly, as shown in
       one of the following examples.

       If <i>exec</i> is specified with <i>command</i>, it shall replace the shell
       with <i>command</i> without creating a new process. If <i>argument</i>s are
       specified, they shall be arguments to <i>command</i>.  Redirection
       affects the current shell execution environment.
