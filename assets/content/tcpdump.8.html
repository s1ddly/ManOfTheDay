       <i>Tcpdump</i> prints out a description of the contents of packets on a
       network interface that match the Boolean <i>expression</i>; the
       description is preceded by a time stamp, printed, by default, as
       hours, minutes, seconds, and fractions of a second since
       midnight.  It can also be run with the <b>-w </b>flag, which causes it
       to save the packet data to a file for later analysis, and/or with
       the <b>-r </b>flag, which causes it to read from a saved packet file
       rather than to read packets from a network interface.  It can
       also be run with the <b>-V </b>flag, which causes it to read a list of
       saved packet files. In all cases, only packets that match
       <i>expression</i> will be processed by <i>tcpdump</i>.

       <i>Tcpdump</i> will, if not run with the <b>-c </b>flag, continue capturing
       packets until it is interrupted by a SIGINT signal (generated,
       for example, by typing your interrupt character, typically
       control-C) or a SIGTERM signal (typically generated with the
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/kill.1.html">kill(1)</a> command); if run with the <b>-c </b>flag, it will capture
       packets until it is interrupted by a SIGINT or SIGTERM signal or
       the specified number of packets have been processed.

       When <i>tcpdump</i> finishes capturing packets, it will report counts
       of:

              packets ``captured'' (this is the number of packets that
              <i>tcpdump</i> has received and processed);

              packets ``received by filter'' (the meaning of this
              depends on the OS on which you're running <i>tcpdump</i>, and
              possibly on the way the OS was configured - if a filter
              was specified on the command line, on some OSes it counts
              packets regardless of whether they were matched by the
              filter expression and, even if they were matched by the
              filter expression, regardless of whether <i>tcpdump</i> has read
              and processed them yet, on other OSes it counts only
              packets that were matched by the filter expression
              regardless of whether <i>tcpdump</i> has read and processed them
              yet, and on other OSes it counts only packets that were
              matched by the filter expression and were processed by
              <i>tcpdump</i>);

              packets ``dropped by kernel'' (this is the number of
              packets that were dropped, due to a lack of buffer space,
              by the packet capture mechanism in the OS on which <i>tcpdump</i>
              is running, if the OS reports that information to
              applications; if not, it will be reported as 0).

       On platforms that support the SIGINFO signal, such as most BSDs
       (including macOS) and Digital/Tru64 UNIX, it will report those
       counts when it receives a SIGINFO signal (generated, for example,
       by typing your ``status'' character, typically control-T,
       although on some platforms, such as macOS, the ``status''
       character is not set by default, so you must set it with <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/stty.1.html">stty(1)</a>
       in order to use it) and will continue capturing packets. On
       platforms that do not support the SIGINFO signal, the same can be
       achieved by using the SIGUSR1 signal.

       Using the SIGUSR2 signal along with the <b>-w </b>flag will forcibly
       flush the packet buffer into the output file.

       Reading packets from a network interface may require that you
       have special privileges; see the <b>pcap</b>(3PCAP) man page for
       details.  Reading a saved packet file doesn't require special
       privileges.
