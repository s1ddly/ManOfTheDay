       The <b>ip neigh </b>command manipulates <i>neighbour</i> objects that establish
       bindings between protocol addresses and link layer addresses for
       hosts sharing the same link.  Neighbour entries are organized
       into tables. The IPv4 neighbour table is also known by another
       name - the ARP table.

       The corresponding commands display neighbour bindings and their
       properties, add new neighbour entries and delete old ones.

       ip neighbour add
              add a new neighbour entry

       ip neighbour change
              change an existing entry

       ip neighbour replace
              add a new entry or change an existing one

              These commands create new neighbour records or update
              existing ones.

              <b>to </b><i>ADDRESS</i> <b>(default)</b>
                     the protocol address of the neighbour. It is either
                     an IPv4 or IPv6 address.

              <b>dev </b><i>NAME</i>
                     the interface to which this neighbour is attached.

              <b>proxy  </b>indicates whether we are proxying for this
                     neighbour entry

              <b>router </b>indicates whether neighbour is a router

              <b>extern_learn</b>
                     this neigh entry was learned externally. This
                     option can be used to indicate to the kernel that
                     this is a controller learnt dynamic entry.  Kernel
                     will not gc such an entry.

              <b>lladdr </b><i>LLADDRESS</i>
                     the link layer address of the neighbour.  <i>LLADDRESS</i>
                     can also be <b>null</b>.

              <b>nud </b><i>STATE</i>
                     the state of the neighbour entry.  <b>nud </b>is an
                     abbreviation for 'Neighbour Unreachability
                     Detection'.  The state can take one of the
                     following values:

                     <b>permanent</b>
                            the neighbour entry is valid forever and can
                            be only be removed administratively.

                     <b>noarp  </b>the neighbour entry is valid. No attempts to
                            validate this entry will be made but it can
                            be removed when its lifetime expires.

                     <b>reachable</b>
                            the neighbour entry is valid until the
                            reachability timeout expires.

                     <b>stale  </b>the neighbour entry is valid but suspicious.
                            This option to <b>ip neigh </b>does not change the
                            neighbour state if it was valid and the
                            address is not changed by this command.

                     <b>none   </b>this is a pseudo state used when initially
                            creating a neighbour entry or after trying
                            to remove it before it becomes free to do
                            so.

                     <b>incomplete</b>
                            the neighbour entry has not (yet) been
                            validated/resolved.

                     <b>delay  </b>neighbor entry validation is currently
                            delayed.

                     <b>probe  </b>neighbor is being probed.

                     <b>failed </b>max number of probes exceeded without
                            success, neighbor validation has ultimately
                            failed.

       ip neighbour delete
              delete a neighbour entry

              The arguments are the same as with <b>ip neigh add</b>, except
              that <b>lladdr </b>and <b>nud </b>are ignored.

              <b>Warning: </b>Attempts to delete or manually change a <b>noarp</b>
              entry created by the kernel may result in unpredictable
              behaviour.  Particularly, the kernel may try to resolve
              this address even on a <b>NOARP </b>interface or if the address
              is multicast or broadcast.

       ip neighbour show
              list neighbour entries

              <b>to </b><i>ADDRESS</i> <b>(default)</b>
                     the prefix selecting the neighbours to list.

              <b>dev </b><i>NAME</i>
                     only list the neighbours attached to this device.

              <b>vrf </b><i>NAME</i>
                     only list the neighbours for given VRF.

              <b>proxy  </b>list neighbour proxies.

              <b>unused </b>only list neighbours which are not currently in
                     use.

              <b>nud </b><i>STATE</i>
                     only list neighbour entries in this state.
                     <i>NUD_STATE</i> takes values listed below or the special
                     value <b>all </b>which means all states. This option may
                     occur more than once.  If this option is absent, <b>ip</b>
                     lists all entries except for <b>none </b>and <b>noarp</b>.

       ip neighbour flush
              flush neighbour entries
              This command has the same arguments as <b>show.  </b>The
              differences are that it does not run when no arguments are
              given, and that the default neighbour states to be flushed
              do not include <b>permanent </b>and <b>noarp</b>.

              With the <b>-statistics </b>option, the command becomes verbose.
              It prints out the number of deleted neighbours and the
              number of rounds made to flush the neighbour table. If the
              option is given twice, <b>ip neigh flush </b>also dumps all the
              deleted neighbours.

       ip neigh get
              lookup a neighbour entry to a destination given a device

              <b>proxy  </b>indicates whether we should lookup a proxy
                     neighbour entry

              <b>to </b><i>ADDRESS</i> <b>(default)</b>
                     the prefix selecting the neighbour to query.

              <b>dev </b><i>NAME</i>
                     get neighbour entry attached to this device.
