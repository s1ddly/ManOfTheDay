       The <b>chpasswd </b>command reads a list of user name and password pairs
       from standard input and uses this information to update a group
       of existing users. Each line is of the format:

       <i>user_name</i>:<i>password</i>

       By default the passwords must be supplied in clear-text, and are
       encrypted by <b>chpasswd</b>. Also the password age will be updated, if
       present.

       By default, passwords are encrypted by PAM, but (even if not
       recommended) you can select a different encryption method with
       the <b>-e</b>, <b>-m</b>, or <b>-c </b>options.

       Except when PAM is used to encrypt the passwords, <b>chpasswd </b>first
       updates all the passwords in memory, and then commits all the
       changes to disk if no errors occurred for any user.

       When PAM is used to encrypt the passwords (and update the
       passwords in the system database) then if a password cannot be
       updated <b>chpasswd </b>continues updating the passwords of the next
       users, and will return an error code on exit.

       This command is intended to be used in a large system environment
       where many accounts are created at a single time.
