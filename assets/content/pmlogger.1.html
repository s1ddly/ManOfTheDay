       <b>pmlogger </b>creates the archive logs of performance metric values
       that may be ``played back'' by other Performance Co-Pilot (see
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/PCPIntro.1.html">PCPIntro(1)</a>) tools.  These logs form the basis of the VCR
       paradigm and retrospective performance analysis services common
       to the PCP toolkit.

       The mandatory argument <i>archive</i> is the base name for the physical
       files that constitute an archive log.  The <i>archive</i> argument may
       contain <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/strftime.3.html">strftime(3)</a> meta-characters, which will be substituted
       prior to creating the archive log files.  When <b>pmlogger </b>is run as
       a service (see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmlogger_daily.1.html">pmlogger_daily(1)</a>), the standard archive base name
       template is <b>%Y%m%d.%H.%M</b>.

       The <b>-V </b>option specifies the version for the archive that is
       generated.  By default a version 2 archive is generated, and the
       only value currently supported for <i>version</i> is 2.

       Unless directed to another host by the <b>-h </b>option or when directly
       using PMDAs via the <b>-o </b>option, <b>pmlogger </b>will contact the
       Performance Metrics Collector Daemon (PMCD) on the local host and
       use that as the source of the metric values to be logged.

       To support the required flexibility and control over what is
       logged and when, <b>pmlogger </b>maintains an independent two level
       logging state for each instance of each performance metric.  At
       the first (mandatory) level, logging is allowed to be <b>on </b>(with an
       associated interval between samples), or <b>off </b>or <b>maybe</b>.  In the
       latter case, the second (advisory) level logging is allowed to be
       <b>on </b>(with an associated interval between samples), or <b>off</b>.

       The mandatory level allows universal specification that some
       metrics must be logged, or must <b>not </b>be logged.  The default state
       for all instances of all metrics when <b>pmlogger </b>starts is
       mandatory maybe and advisory off.

       Use <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmlc.1.html">pmlc(1)</a> to interrogate and change the logging state once
       <b>pmlogger </b>is running.

       If a metric's state is mandatory (on or off) and a request is
       made to change it to mandatory maybe, the new state is mandatory
       maybe and advisory off.  If a metric's state is already advisory
       (on or off) and a request is made to change it to mandatory
       maybe, the current state is retained.

       It is not possible for <b>pmlogger </b>to log specific instances of a
       metric and all instances of the same metric concurrently.  If
       specific instances are being logged and a request to log all
       instances is made, then all instances of the metric will be
       logged according to the new request, superseding any prior
       logging request for the metric.  A request to log all instances
       of a metric will supersede any previous request to log all
       instances.  A request to log specific instances of a metric when
       all instances are already being logged is refused.  To do this
       one must turn off logging for all instances of the metric first.
       In each case, the validity of the request is checked first; for
       example a request to change a metric's logging state to advisory
       on when it is currently mandatory off is never permitted (it is
       necessary to change the state to mandatory maybe first).

       Optionally, each system running <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> may also be configured to
       run a ``primary'' <b>pmlogger </b>instance.  This <b>pmlogger </b>instance is
       launched by <b>$PCP_RC_DIR/pmlogger</b>, and is affected by the files
       <i>$PCP_SYSCONF_DIR/pmlogger/control</i>,
       <i>$PCP_SYSCONF_DIR/pmlogger/control</i>.d (use <b>chkconfig</b>(8),
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/systemctl.1.html">systemctl(1)</a> or similar platform-specific commands to activate or
       disable the primary <b>pmlogger </b>instance),
       <i>$PCP_SYSCONFIG_DIR/pmlogger</i> (environment variable settings for
       the primary <b>pmlogger</b>) <i>$PCP_SYSCONF_DIR/pmlogger/pmlogger.options</i>
       (command line options passed to the primary <b>pmlogger</b>) and
       <i>$PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmlogger/config.default</i> (the default initial
       configuration file for the primary <b>pmlogger</b>).

       The primary <b>pmlogger </b>instance is identified by the <b>-P </b>option.
       There may be at most one ``primary'' <b>pmlogger </b>instance on each
       system.  The primary <b>pmlogger </b>instance (if any) must be running
       on the same host as the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> to which it connects (if any), so
       the <b>-h </b>and <b>-P </b>options are mutually exclusive.

       Logging of some metrics is possible even in the absence of a
       local <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a>, using the "local context" mode of operation.  This
       is activated using the <b>-o </b>option, and causes <b>pmlogger </b>to make use
       of local DSO PMDAs instead of communicating with <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a>.  When
       operating using a local context, the <b>-K </b>option may be used to
       control the DSO PMDAs that should be made accessible.  The <i>spec</i>
       argument conforms to the syntax described in <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/pmSpecLocalPMDA.3.html">pmSpecLocalPMDA(3)</a>.
       More than one <b>-K </b>option may be used.

       When launched as a non-primary instance, <b>pmlogger </b>will exit
       immediately if the configuration file causes no metric logging to
       be scheduled.  The <b>-L </b>option overrides this behavior, and causes
       a non-primary <b>pmlogger </b>instance to ``linger'', presumably pending
       some future dynamic re-configuration and state change via
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmlc.1.html">pmlc(1)</a>.  <b>pmlogger </b>will also linger without the <b>-L </b>option being
       used if all the metrics to be logged are logged as once only
       metrics.  When the once only metrics have been logged, a warning
       message will be generated stating that the event queue is empty
       and no more events will be scheduled.

       By default all diagnostics and errors from <b>pmlogger </b>are written
       to the file <i>pmlogger.log</i> in the directory where <b>pmlogger </b>is
       launched.  The <b>-l </b>option may be used to override the default
       behavior.  If the log file cannot be created or is not writable,
       output is written to standard error instead.  If the <i>logfile</i> for
       the <b>-l </b>option is "<b>-</b>" (i.e.  <b>-l-</b>) then log messages are written to
       the standard output stream.  This can be particularly useful when
       running <b>pmlogger </b>manually, rather than as a service daemon.

       The <b>-N </b>option directs <b>pmlogger </b>to notify a service manager,
       typically <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/systemd.1.html">systemd(1)</a>, when it has started and is about to begin
       writing PCP archive logs.  This option would only normally be
       used when <b>pmlogger </b>is run as a daemon service under the control
       of a service manager.  For more details, see
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/__pmServerNotifyServiceManagerReady.3.html">__pmServerNotifyServiceManagerReady(3)</a> and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/systemd.1.html">systemd(1)</a>.  On
       platforms that do not use a service manager that supports
       notifications, the <b>-N </b>option is basically a no-op.

       If specified, the <b>-s </b>option instructs <b>pmlogger </b>to terminate after
       a certain size in records, bytes or time units has been
       accumulated.  If <i>endsize</i> is an integer then <i>endsize</i> records will
       be written to the log.  If <i>endsize</i> is an integer suffixed by <b>b </b>or
       <b>bytes </b>then <i>endsize</i> bytes of the archive data will be written out
       (note, however, that archive log record boundaries will not be
       broken and so this limit may be slightly surpassed).  Other
       viable file size units include: <b>K</b>, <b>Kb</b>, <b>KiB</b>, <b>Kbyte</b>, <b>Kilobyte </b>for
       kilobytes and <b>M</b>, <b>Mb</b>, <b>MiB</b>, <b>Mbyte</b>, <b>Megabyte </b>for megabytes and <b>G</b>,
       <b>Gb</b>, <b>GiB</b>, <b>Gbyte</b>, <b>Gigabyte </b>for gigabytes.  These units may be
       optionally suffixed by an <b>s </b>and may be of mixed case.
       Alternatively <i>endsize</i> may be an integer or a floating point
       number suffixed using a time unit as described in <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/PCPIntro.1.html">PCPIntro(1)</a> for
       the <i>interval</i> argument (to the standard PCP <b>-t </b>command line
       option).
       Some examples of different formats:
          <b>-s 100</b>
          <b>-s 100bytes</b>
          <b>-s 100K</b>
          <b>-s 100Mb</b>
          <b>-s 10Gbyte</b>
          <b>-s 10mins</b>
          <b>-s 1.5hours</b>
       The default is for <b>pmlogger </b>to run forever.

       The <b>-r </b>option causes the size of the physical record(s) for each
       group of metrics and the expected contribution of the group to
       the size of the PCP archive for one full day of collection to be
       reported in the log file.  This information is reported the first
       time each group is successfully written to the archive.

       The <b>-U </b>option specifies the user account under which to run
       <b>pmlogger</b>.  The default is the current user account for
       interactive use.  When run as a daemon, the unprivileged "pcp"
       account is used in current versions of PCP, but in older versions
       the superuser account ("root") was used by default.

       The log file is potentially a multi-volume data set, and the <b>-v</b>
       option causes <b>pmlogger </b>to start a new volume after a certain size
       in records, bytes, or time units has been accumulated for the
       current volume.  The format of this size specification is
       identical to that of the <b>-s </b>option (see above).  The default is
       for <b>pmlogger </b>to create a single volume log.  Additional volume
       switches can also be forced asynchronously by either using
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmlc.1.html">pmlc(1)</a> or sending <b>pmlogger </b>a SIGHUP signal (see below).  Note,
       if a scheduled volume switch is in operation due to the <b>-v</b>
       option, then its counters will be reset after an asynchronous
       switch.

       Independent of any <b>-v </b>option, each volume of an archive is
       limited to no more than 2^31 bytes, so <i>pmlogger</i> will
       automatically create a new volume for the archive before this
       limit is reached.

       Normally <b>pmlogger </b>operates on the distributed Performance Metrics
       Name Space (PMNS), however if the <b>-n </b>option is specified an
       alternative local PMNS is loaded from the file <i>pmnsfile</i>.

       Under normal circumstances, <b>pmlogger </b>will run forever (except for
       a <b>-s </b>option or a termination signal).  The <b>-T </b>option may be used
       to limit the execution time using the format of time as
       prescribed by <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/PCPIntro.1.html">PCPIntro(1)</a>.  The time is interpreted within the
       time zone of the PMCD server, unless the <b>-y </b>option is given,
       within which case the time zone at this logger host is used.
       Some examples of different formats:
          <b>-T 10mins</b>
          <b>-T '@ 11:30'</b>
       From this it can be seen that <b>-T 10mins </b>and <b>-s 10mins </b>perform
       identical actions.

       Alternatively, <b>pmlogger </b>runtime may be limited to the lifetime of
       another process by using the <b>-p </b>or <b>--PID </b>option to nominate the
       PID of the process of interest.  In this case the <b>pmlogger </b>will
       exit when the other process no longer exists.

       When <b>pmlogger </b>receives a <b>SIGHUP </b>signal, the current volume of the
       log is closed, and a new volume is opened.  This mechanism (or
       the alternative mechanism via <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmlc.1.html">pmlc(1)</a>) may be used to manage the
       growth of the log files - once a log volume is closed, that file
       may be archived without ill-effect on the continued operation of
       <b>pmlogger</b>.  See also the <b>-v </b>option above.

       When <b>pmlogger </b>receives a <b>SIGUSR2 </b>signal, the current archive log
       is closed, and a new archive is opened.  For this to succeed, the
       original <i>archive</i> argument must include <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/strftime.3.html">strftime(3)</a> meta
       characters (e.g.  <b>%Y%m%d.%H.%M</b>), otherwise <b>pmlogger </b>will exit
       because the archive files will already exist and <b>pmlogger </b>will
       not over-write existing archive files.  Note that <b>SIGUSR2</b>
       triggers <b>pmlogger </b>to re-exec itself and re-parse all original
       arguments.  This means that any relative time limits placed on
       it's termination time or sampling limit are reset and begin
       again.  This only affects relative termination times, not
       absolute times e.g.  <b>-T 5s </b>is affected, but <b>-T 5pm </b>is not.

       Historically the buffers for the current log may be flushed to
       disk using the <b>flush </b>command of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmlc.1.html">pmlc(1)</a>, or by using the <b>-u</b>
       option.  The current version of <i>pmlogger</i> and the <i>libpcp</i> routines
       that underpin <i>pmlogger</i> unconditionally use unbuffered writes and
       a single <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/fwrite.3.html">fwrite(3)</a> for each logical record written, and so
       ``flushing'' does not force any additional data to be written to
       the file system.  The <b>-u </b>option and the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmlc.1.html">pmlc(1)</a> <b>flush </b>command are
       retained for backwards compatibility.

       When launched with the <b>-x </b>option, pmlogger will accept
       asynchronous control requests on the file descriptor <i>fd</i>.  This
       option is only expected to be used internally by PCP applications
       that support ``live record mode''.

       The <b>-m </b>option allows the string <i>note</i> to be appended to the map
       file for this instance of <b>pmlogger </b>in the <b>$PCP_TMP_DIR/pmlogger</b>
       directory.  This is currently used internally to document the
       file descriptor (<i>fd</i>) when the <b>-x </b>option is used, or to indicate
       that this <b>pmlogger </b>instance was started under the control of
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmlogger_check.1.html">pmlogger_check(1)</a>, (<b>-m pmlogger_check</b>) or was re-exec'd (see
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/execvp.3.html">execvp(3)</a>) due to a <b>SIGUSR2 </b>signal being recieved as described
       above (<b>-m reexec</b>).

       The <b>-H </b>option allows the hostname written into the archive label
       to be overridden.  This mirrors the <b>-H </b>option of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> , but
       allows it to be specified on the <b>pmlogger </b>process.  Without this
       option, the value returned from the logged <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> is used.

       The <b>-C </b>option will cause the configuration file to be parsed and
       <i>pmlogger</i> will then exit without creating an output archive, so
       when <b>-C </b>is specified, the <i>archive</i> command line argument is not
       required.  Any errors in the configuration file are reported.
