     <b>ssh-keyscan </b>is a utility for gathering the public SSH host keys of
     a number of hosts.  It was designed to aid in building and
     verifying <i>ssh_known_hosts</i> files, the format of which is documented
     in sshd(8).  <b>ssh-keyscan </b>provides a minimal interface suitable for
     use by shell and perl scripts.

     <b>ssh-keyscan </b>uses non-blocking socket I/O to contact as many hosts
     as possible in parallel, so it is very efficient.  The keys from a
     domain of 1,000 hosts can be collected in tens of seconds, even
     when some of those hosts are down or do not run sshd(8).  For
     scanning, one does not need login access to the machines that are
     being scanned, nor does the scanning process involve any
     encryption.

     The options are as follows:

     <b>-4      </b>Force <b>ssh-keyscan </b>to use IPv4 addresses only.

     <b>-6      </b>Force <b>ssh-keyscan </b>to use IPv6 addresses only.

     <b>-c      </b>Request certificates from target hosts instead of plain
             keys.

     <b>-D      </b>Print keys found as SSHFP DNS records.  The default is to
             print keys in a format usable as a ssh(1) <i>known_hosts</i> file.

     <b>-f </b><i>file</i>
             Read hosts or “addrlist namelist” pairs from <i>file</i>, one per
             line.  If ‘-’ is supplied instead of a filename,
             <b>ssh-keyscan </b>will read from the standard input.  Input is
             expected in the format:

             1.2.3.4,1.2.4.4 name.my.domain,name,n.my.domain,n,1.2.3.4,1.2.4.4

     <b>-H      </b>Hash all hostnames and addresses in the output.  Hashed
             names may be used normally by ssh(1) and sshd(8), but they
             do not reveal identifying information should the file's
             contents be disclosed.

     <b>-p </b><i>port</i>
             Connect to <i>port</i> on the remote host.

     <b>-T </b><i>timeout</i>
             Set the timeout for connection attempts.  If <i>timeout</i>
             seconds have elapsed since a connection was initiated to a
             host or since the last time anything was read from that
             host, the connection is closed and the host in question
             considered unavailable.  The default is 5 seconds.

     <b>-t </b><i>type</i>
             Specify the type of the key to fetch from the scanned
             hosts.  The possible values are “dsa”, “ecdsa”, “ed25519”,
             or “rsa”.  Multiple values may be specified by separating
             them with commas.  The default is to fetch “rsa”, “ecdsa”,
             and “ed25519” keys.

     <b>-v      </b>Verbose mode: print debugging messages about progress.

     If an ssh_known_hosts file is constructed using <b>ssh-keyscan </b>without
     verifying the keys, users will be vulnerable to <i>man in the middle</i>
     attacks.  On the other hand, if the security model allows such a
     risk, <b>ssh-keyscan </b>can help in the detection of tampered keyfiles or
     man in the middle attacks which have begun after the
     ssh_known_hosts file was created.
