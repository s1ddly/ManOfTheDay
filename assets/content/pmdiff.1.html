       <b>pmdiff </b>compares the average values for every metric in either one
       or two sets of archives, in a given time window, for changes that
       are likely to be of interest when searching for performance
       regressions.

       The archive specifiers <i>archive1</i> and <i>archive2</i> may be comma-
       separated lists of names, each of which may be the base name of
       an archive or the name of a directory containing one or more
       archives. Each archive in the resulting set of archives must have
       been previously created using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a>.  The <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmlogsummary.1.html">pmlogsummary(1)</a>
       utility is used to obtain the average values used for comparison.

       There are two sorts of invocation of the tool: with either one or
       two sets of archives.

       In the first case, the only sensible command line requires use of
       all four time window arguments.  These are specified using the
       same time window format described in <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/PCPIntro.1.html">PCPIntro(1)</a>, and are
       <b>-S</b>/<b>--start </b>and <b>-T</b>/<b>--finish </b>for the start and end times of the
       first time window of interest in the archive set, and <b>-B</b>/<b>--before</b>
       and <b>-E</b>/<b>--end </b>for the start and end times of the second time
       window of interest.

       In the second case, with two sets of archives, the <b>-B</b>/<b>--before</b>
       and <b>-E</b>/<b>--end </b>options might be unnecessary.  This might be the
       case, for example, when comparing the same time window of two
       consecutive days (usually two separate sets of archives), or a
       time window on the same day of different weeks.

       In either case, <b>pmdiff </b>produces a sorted summary of those metrics
       in the specified window whose values have deviated the most from
       a minimal threshold.  The level of deviation is calculated by
       dividing the average value of each metric in both logs, and then
       calculating whether the ratio falls outside of a range considered
       normal.  This ratio can be adjusted using the <b>-q</b>/<b>--threshold</b>
       option, and by default it is 2 (i.e. report all metrics with
       average values that have more than doubled in the two time
       windows or more than halved in the two time windows).

       If the baseline value is zero and the comparison value is non-
       zero, the ratio is reported as ``|+|'' (infinitely large).  If
       the comparison value is zero and the baseline value is non-zero,
       the ratio is reported as ``|-|'' (infinitely small).

       Reported metrics are sorted in ascending ratio order.

       Should any metrics be present in one window but missing from the
       other, a diagnostic will be displayed listing each missing metric
       and the archive set from which it was missing.

       Metrics with counter semantics are converted to rates before
       being evaluated.
