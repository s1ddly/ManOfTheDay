       <b>systemd-socket-activate </b>may be used to launch a socket-activated
       service program from the command line for testing purposes. It
       may also be used to launch individual instances of the service
       program per connection.

       The daemon to launch and its options should be specified after
       options intended for <b>systemd-socket-activate</b>.

       If the <b>--inetd </b>option is given, the socket file descriptor will
       be used as the standard input and output of the launched process.
       Otherwise, standard input and output will be inherited, and
       sockets will be passed through file descriptors 3 and higher.
       Sockets passed through <i>$LISTEN_FDS</i> to <b>systemd-socket-activate</b>
       will be passed through to the daemon, in the original positions.
       Other sockets specified with <b>--listen= </b>will use consecutive
       descriptors. By default, <b>systemd-socket-activate </b>listens on a
       stream socket, use <b>--datagram </b>and <b>--seqpacket </b>to listen on
       datagram or sequential packet sockets instead (see below).
