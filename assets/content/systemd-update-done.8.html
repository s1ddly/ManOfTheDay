       systemd-update-done.service is a service that is invoked as part
       of the first boot after the vendor operating system resources in
       /usr/ have been updated. This is useful to implement offline
       updates of /usr/ which might require updates to /etc/ or /var/ on
       the following boot.

       systemd-update-done.service updates the file modification time
       (mtime) of the stamp files /etc/.updated and /var/.updated to the
       modification time of the /usr/ directory, unless the stamp files
       are already newer.

       Services that shall run after offline upgrades of /usr/ should
       order themselves before systemd-update-done.service, and use the
       <i>ConditionNeedsUpdate=</i> (see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/systemd.unit.5.html">systemd.unit(5)</a>) condition to make
       sure to run when /etc/ or /var/ are older than /usr/ according to
       the modification times of the files described above. This
       requires that updates to /usr/ are always followed by an update
       of the modification time of /usr/, for example by invoking
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/touch.1.html">touch(1)</a> on it.

       Note that if the <i>systemd.condition-needs-update=</i> kernel command
       line option is used it overrides the <i>ConditionNeedsUpdate=</i> unit
       condition checks. In that case systemd-update-done.service will
       not reset the condition state until a follow-up reboot where the
       kernel switch is not specified anymore.
