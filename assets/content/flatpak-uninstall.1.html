       Uninstalls an application or runtime.  REF is a reference to the
       application or runtime to uninstall.

       Each REF argument is a full or partial identifier in the flatpak
       ref format, which looks like "(app|runtime)/ID/ARCH/BRANCH". All
       elements except ID are optional and can be left out, including
       the slashes, so most of the time you need only specify ID. Any
       part left out will be matched against what is installed, and if
       there are multiple matches you will be prompted to choose between
       them. You will also be prompted if REF doesn't match any
       installed ref exactly but is similar (e.g. "gedit" is similar to
       "org.gnome.gedit").

       By default this looks for both installed apps and runtimes with
       the given REF, but you can limit this by using the <b>--app </b>or
       <b>--runtime </b>option, or by supplying the initial element in the REF.

       Normally, this command removes the ref for this
       application/runtime from the local OSTree repository and purges
       any objects that are no longer needed to free up disk space. If
       the same application is later reinstalled, the objects will be
       pulled from the remote repository again. The <b>--keep-ref </b>option
       can be used to prevent this.

       When <b>--delete-data </b>is specified while removing an app, its data
       directory in ~/.var/app and any permissions it might have are
       removed. When <b>--delete-data </b>is used without a REF, all 'unowned'
       app data is removed.

       Unless overridden with the <b>--system</b>, <b>--user</b>, or <b>--installation</b>
       options, this command searches both the system-wide installation
       and the per-user one for REF and errors out if it exists in more
       than one.
