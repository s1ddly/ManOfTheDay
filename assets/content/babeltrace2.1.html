       <b>babeltrace2 </b>is an open-source trace converter and processor
       command-line program. The tool can open one or more traces and
       convert between multiple formats, possibly with one or more
       filters in the conversion path, and perform other operations
       depending on the command <i>CMD</i> (see “COMMANDS”).

           <b>Note</b>
           You might be looking for the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/babeltrace2-convert.1.html">babeltrace2-convert(1)</a> command’s
           manual page; the <b>convert </b>command is the default command of
           <b>babeltrace2 </b>and is backward compatible with <b>babeltrace</b>(1).

           See “EXAMPLES” for <b>convert </b>command examples.

       See <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/babeltrace2-intro.7.html">babeltrace2-intro(7)</a> to learn more about the Babeltrace 2
       project and its core concepts.

       Most of the <b>babeltrace2 </b>commands load Babeltrace 2 plugins to
       perform their operation. The search path for Babeltrace 2 plugins
       is, in this order:

        1. The colon-separated (or semicolon, on Windows) list of
           directories in the <b>BABELTRACE_PLUGIN_PATH </b>environment
           variable.

        2. The colon-separated (or semicolon, on Windows) list of
           directories in the <b>--plugin-path </b>option.

        3. <b>$HOME/.local/lib/babeltrace2/plugins</b>

        4. <b>/usr/local/lib/babeltrace2/plugins</b>

       You can use the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/babeltrace2-list-plugins.1.html">babeltrace2-list-plugins(1)</a> command to
       dynamically list the available plugins and what they offer. See
       “PROJECT’S PLUGINS” for a list of plugins shipped with
       Babeltrace 2.
