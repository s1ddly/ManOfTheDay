       Git differs from CVS in that every working tree contains a
       repository with a full copy of the project history, and no
       repository is inherently more important than any other. However,
       you can emulate the CVS model by designating a single shared
       repository which people can synchronize with; this document
       explains how to do that.

       Some basic familiarity with Git is required. Having gone through
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/gittutorial.7.html">gittutorial(7)</a> and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/gitglossary.7.html">gitglossary(7)</a> should be sufficient.
