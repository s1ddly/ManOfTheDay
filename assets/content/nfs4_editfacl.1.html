<pre>
       <b>nfs4_setfacl </b>manipulates the NFSv4 Access Control List (ACL) of
       one or more <i>files</i> (or directories), provided they are on a
       mounted NFSv4 filesystem which supports ACLs.

       <b>nfs4_editfacl </b>is equivalent to <b>nfs4_setfacl -e</b>.

       Refer to the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/nfs4_acl.5.html">nfs4_acl(5)</a> manpage for information about NFSv4 ACL
       terminology and syntax.

   <b>COMMANDS</b>
       <b>-a </b><i>acl_spec</i> [<i>index</i>]
              add the ACEs from <i>acl_spec</i> to <i>file</i>'s ACL.  ACEs are
              inserted starting at the <i>index</i>th position (DEFAULT: 1) of
              <i>file</i>'s ACL.

       <b>-A </b><i>acl_file</i> [<i>index</i>]
              add the ACEs from the acl_spec in <i>acl_file</i> to <i>file</i>'s ACL.
              ACEs are inserted starting at the <i>index</i>th position
              (DEFAULT: 1) of <i>file</i>'s ACL.

       <b>-x </b><i>acl_spec</i> | <i>index</i>
              delete ACEs matched from <i>acl_spec</i> - or delete the <i>index</i>th
              ACE - from <i>file</i>'s ACL.  Note that the ordering of the ACEs
              in <i>acl_spec</i> does not matter.

       <b>-X </b><i>acl_file</i>
              delete ACEs matched from the acl_spec in <i>acl_file</i> from
              <i>file</i>'s ACL.  Note that the ordering of the ACEs in the
              acl_spec does not matter.

       <b>-s </b><i>acl_spec</i>
              set <i>file</i>'s ACL to <i>acl_spec</i>.

       <b>-S </b><i>acl_file</i>
              set <i>file</i>'s ACL to the acl_spec in <i>acl_file</i>.

       <b>-e</b>, <b>--edit</b>
              edit <i>file</i>'s ACL in the editor defined in the EDITOR
              environment variable (DEFAULT: <b>vi</b>(1)) and set the
              resulting ACL upon a clean exit, assuming changes made in
              the editor were saved.  Note that if multiple <i>files</i> are
              specified, the editor will be serially invoked once per
              <i>file</i>.

       <b>-m </b><i>from_ace to_ace</i>
              modify <i>file</i>'s ACL in-place by replacing <i>from_ace</i> with
              <i>to_ace</i>.

       <b>-?</b>, <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              display help text and exit.

       <b>--version</b>
              display this program's version and exit.

       NOTE: if '-' is given as the <i>acl_file</i> with the <b>-A</b>/<b>-X</b>/<b>-S </b>flags,
       the acl_spec will be read from stdin.

   <b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>-R</b>, <b>--recursive</b>
              recursively apply to a directory's files and
              subdirectories.  Similar to <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/setfacl.1.html">setfacl(1)</a>, the default
              behavior is to follow symlinks given on the command line
              and to skip symlinks encountered while recursing through
              directories.

       <b>-L</b>, <b>--logical</b>
              in conjunction with <b>-R</b>/<b>--recursive</b>, a logical walk follows
              all symbolic links.

       <b>-P</b>, <b>--physical</b>
              in conjunction with <b>-R</b>/<b>--recursive</b>, a physical walk skips
              all symbolic links.

       <b>--test</b>
              display results of <b>COMMAND</b>, but do not save changes.
