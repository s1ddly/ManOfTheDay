       <b>e2freefrag </b>is used to report free space fragmentation on ext2/3/4
       file systems.  <i>filesys</i> is the file system device name (e.g.
       <i>/dev/hdc1</i>, <i>/dev/md0</i>).  The <b>e2freefrag </b>program will scan the block
       bitmap information to check how many free blocks are present as
       contiguous and aligned free space. The percentage of contiguous
       free blocks of size and of alignment <i>chunk_kb</i> is reported.  It
       also displays the minimum/maximum/average free chunk size in the
       file system, along with a histogram of all free chunks.  This
       information can be used to gauge the level of free space
       fragmentation in the file system.
