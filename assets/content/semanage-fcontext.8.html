       semanage is used to configure certain elements of SELinux policy
       without requiring modification to or recompilation from policy
       sources.  semanage fcontext is used to  manage the default file
       system labeling on an SELinux system.  This command maps file
       paths using regular expressions to SELinux labels.

       FILE_SPEC may contain either a fully qualified path, or a Perl
       compatible regular expression (PCRE), describing fully qualified
       path(s). The only PCRE flag in use is PCRE2_DOTALL, which causes
       a wildcard '.' to match anything, including a new line.  Strings
       representing paths are processed as bytes (as opposed to
       Unicode), meaning that non-ASCII characters are not matched by a
       single wildcard.

       Note, that file context definitions specified using 'semanage
       fcontext' (i.e. local file context modifications stored in
       file_contexts.local) have higher priority than those specified in
       policy modules.  This means that whenever a match for given file
       path is found in file_contexts.local, no other file context
       definitions are considered.  Entries in file_contexts.local are
       processed from most recent one to the oldest, with first match
       being used (as opposed to the most specific match, which is used
       when matching other file context definitions).  All regular
       expressions should therefore be as specific as possible, to avoid
       unintentionally impacting other parts of the filesystem.
