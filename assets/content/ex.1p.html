       The <i>ex</i> utility is a line-oriented text editor. There are two
       other modes of the editor—open and visual—in which screen-
       oriented editing is available. This is described more fully by
       the <i>ex</i> <b>open </b>and <b>visual </b>commands and in <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/vi.1p.html">vi(1p)</a>.

       If an operand is <b>'-'</b>, the results are unspecified.

       This section uses the term <i>edit buffer</i> to describe the current
       working text. No specific implementation is implied by this term.
       All editing changes are performed on the edit buffer, and no
       changes to it shall affect any file until an editor command
       writes the file.

       Certain terminals do not have all the capabilities necessary to
       support the complete <i>ex</i> definition, such as the full-screen
       editing commands (<i>visual mode</i> or <i>open mode</i>).  When these commands
       cannot be supported on such terminals, this condition shall not
       produce an error message such as ``not an editor command'' or
       report a syntax error. The implementation may either accept the
       commands and produce results on the screen that are the result of
       an unsuccessful attempt to meet the requirements of this volume
       of POSIX.1‐2017 or report an error describing the terminal-
       related deficiency.
