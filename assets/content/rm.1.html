       This manual page documents the GNU version of <b>rm</b>.  <b>rm </b>removes
       each specified file.  By default, it does not remove directories.

       If the <i>-I</i> or <i>--interactive=once</i> option is given, and there are
       more than three files or the <i>-r</i>, <i>-R</i>, or <i>--recursive</i> are given,
       then <b>rm </b>prompts the user for whether to proceed with the entire
       operation.  If the response is not affirmative, the entire
       command is aborted.

       Otherwise, if a file is unwritable, standard input is a terminal,
       and the <i>-f</i> or <i>--force</i> option is not given, or the <i>-i</i> or
       <i>--interactive=always</i> option is given, <b>rm </b>prompts the user for
       whether to remove the file.  If the response is not affirmative,
       the file is skipped.
