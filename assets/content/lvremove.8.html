       lvremove removes one or more LVs. For standard LVs, this returns
       the logical extents that were used by the LV to the VG for use by
       other LVs.

       Confirmation will be requested before deactivating any active LV
       prior to removal.  LVs cannot be deactivated or removed while
       they are open (e.g.  if they contain a mounted filesystem).
       Removing an origin LV will also remove all dependent snapshots.

       When a single force option is used, LVs are removed without
       confirmation, and the command will try to deactivate unused LVs.

       To remove damaged LVs, two force options may be required (<b>-ff</b>).

       <b>Historical LVs</b>

       If the configuration setting <b>metadata/record_lvs_history </b>is
       enabled and the LV being removed forms part of the history of at
       least one LV that is still present, then a simplified
       representation of the LV will be retained. This includes the time
       of removal (<b>lv_time_removed </b>reporting field), creation time
       (<b>lv_time</b>), name (<b>lv_name</b>), LV uuid (<b>lv_uuid</b>) and VG name
       (<b>vg_name</b>). This allows later reporting to see the ancestry chain
       of thin snapshot volumes, even after some intermediate LVs have
       been removed. The names of such historical LVs acquire a hyphen
       as a prefix (e.g. '-lvol1') and cannot be reactivated.  Use
       lvremove a second time, with the hyphen, to remove the record of
       the former LV completely.
