       Entries in the journal (as written by
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/systemd-journald.service.8.html">systemd-journald.service(8)</a>) resemble a UNIX process environment
       block in syntax but with fields that may include binary data.
       Primarily, fields are formatted UTF-8 text strings, and binary
       encoding is used only where formatting as UTF-8 text strings
       makes little sense. New fields may freely be defined by
       applications, but a few fields have special meanings. All fields
       with special meanings are optional. In some cases, fields may
       appear more than once per entry.
