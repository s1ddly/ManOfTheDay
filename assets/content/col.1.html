       <b>col </b>filters out reverse (and half-reverse) line feeds so the
       output is in the correct order, with only forward and
       half-forward line feeds. It also replaces any whitespace
       characters with tabs where possible. This can be useful in
       processing the output of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/nroff.1.html">nroff(1)</a> and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/tbl.1.html">tbl(1)</a>.

       <b>col </b>reads from standard input and writes to standard output.
