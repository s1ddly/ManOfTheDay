       <b>pmdamailq </b>is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
       extracts performance metrics describing the state of the e-mail
       queues managed by <b>sendmail</b>(1) and other mail transfer agents.

       The <b>mailq </b>PMDA exports metrics that measure the total number of
       entries in the mail queue, and the subtotals for entries that
       have been queued for various time periods.

       A brief description of the <b>pmdamailq </b>command line options
       follows:

       <b>-b   </b>The <i>binlist</i> argument specifies a list of delay thresholds
            used to ``bin'' the entries in the queue into a a histogram
            based on how long the entry has been in the mail queue.  The
            default thresholds are: 1 hour, 4 hours, 8 hours, 1 day, 3
            days and 7 days.  The entries in <i>binlist</i> are comma separated
            time intervals, using the syntax described in <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/PCPIntro.1.html">PCPIntro(1)</a>
            for an update or reporting interval, e.g. the default list
            could be specified using the value
            <b>1hr,4hrs,8hrs,1day,3days,7days</b>.

            Values in <i>binlist</i> are assumed to be in ascending order, and
            mail items in the queue less than the first threshold are
            binned into a special bin labeled ``recent''.

       <b>-d   </b>It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics <i>domain</i>
            number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is,
            <i>domain</i> should be different for every PMDA on the one host,
            and the same <i>domain</i> number should be used for the same PMDA
            on all hosts.

       <b>-l   </b>Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
            <i>mailq.log</i> is written in the current directory of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a>
            when <b>pmdamailq </b>is started, i.e.  <b>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd .  </b>If the
            log file cannot be created or is not writable, output is
            written to the standard error instead.

       <b>-r   </b>Use an extended regular expression to match file names in
            the mail queue directory, rather than assuming all "df"
            prefixed files in the directory are mail files (the "df"
            prefix is the <b>sendmail </b>convention, but this convention is
            not followed by other mail daemons).  The <i>regex</i> pattern
            specified should conform to the POSIX format described in
            <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/regex.3.html">regex(3)</a>, and it describes file names that should be
            considered mail.

       <b>-U   </b>User account under which to run the agent.  The default is
            the unprivileged "pcp" account in current versions of PCP,
            but in older versions the superuser account ("root") was
            used by default.

       The optional <i>queuedir</i> argument defines the directory in which
       <b>pmdamailq </b>expects to find the mail queue.  The default is
       <b>/var/spool/mqueue</b>.
