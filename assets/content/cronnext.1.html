<pre>
       Determine the time cron will execute the next job.  Without
       arguments, it prints that time considering all crontabs, in
       number of seconds since the Epoch, rounded to the minute. This
       number can be converted into other formats using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/date.1.html">date(1)</a>, like
       <b>date --date @43243254</b>

       The file arguments are optional. If provided, <i>cronnext</i> uses them
       as crontabs instead of the ones installed in the system.
