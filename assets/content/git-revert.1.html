       Given one or more existing commits, revert the changes that the
       related patches introduce, and record some new commits that
       record them. This requires your working tree to be clean (no
       modifications from the HEAD commit).

       Note: <i>git revert</i> is used to record some new commits to reverse
       the effect of some earlier commits (often only a faulty one). If
       you want to throw away all uncommitted changes in your working
       directory, you should see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/git-reset.1.html">git-reset(1)</a>, particularly the <b>--hard</b>
       option. If you want to extract specific files as they were in
       another commit, you should see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/git-restore.1.html">git-restore(1)</a>, specifically the
       <b>--source </b>option. Take care with these alternatives as both will
       discard uncommitted changes in your working directory.

       See "Reset, restore and revert" in <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/git.1.html">git(1)</a> for the differences
       between the three commands.
