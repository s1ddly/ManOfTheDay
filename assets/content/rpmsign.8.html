       Both of the <b>--addsign </b>and <b>--resign </b>options generate and insert
       new signatures for each package <i>PACKAGE_FILE</i> given, replacing any
       existing signatures.  There are two options for historical
       reasons, there is no difference in behavior currently.

       To create a signature rpm needs to verify the package's checksum.
       As a result packages with a MD5/SHA1 checksums cannot be signed
       in FIPS mode.

       <b>rpm --delsign </b><i>PACKAGE_FILE ...</i>

       Delete all signatures from each package <i>PACKAGE_FILE</i> given.

       <b>rpm --delfilesign </b><i>PACKAGE_FILE ...</i>

       Delete all IMA and fsverity file signatures from each package
       <i>PACKAGE_FILE</i> given.

   <b>SIGN OPTIONS</b>
       <b>--rpmv3</b>
              Force RPM V3 header+payload signature addition.  These are
              expensive and redundant baggage on packages where a
              separate payload digest exists (packages built with rpm &gt;=
              4.14).  Rpm will automatically detect the need for V3
              signatures, but this option can be used to force their
              creation if the packages must be fully signature
              verifiable with rpm &lt; 4.14 or other interoperability
              reasons.

       <b>--fskpath </b><i>KEY</i>
              Used with <b>--signfiles</b>, use file signing key <i>Key</i>.

       <b>--certpath </b><i>CERT</i>
              Used with <b>--signverity</b>, use file signing certificate <i>Cert</i>.

       <b>--verityalgo </b><i>ALG</i>
              Used with <b>--signverity</b>, to specify the signing algorithm.
              sha256 and sha512 are supported, with sha256 being the
              default if this argument is not specified.  This can also
              be specified with the macro %_verity_algorithm

       <b>--signfiles</b>
              Sign package files.  The macro
              <b>%_binary_filedigest_algorithm </b>must be set to a supported
              algorithm before building the package.  The supported
              algorithms are SHA1, SHA256, SHA384, and SHA512, which are
              represented as 2, 8, 9, and 10 respectively.  The file
              signing key (RSA private key) must be set before signing
              the package, it can be configured on the command line with
              <b>--fskpath </b>or the macro %_file_signing_key.

       <b>--signverity</b>
              Sign package files with fsverity signatures.  The file
              signing key (RSA private key) and the signing certificate
              must be set before signing the package.  The key can be
              configured on the command line with <b>--fskpath </b>or the macro
              %_file_signing_key, and the cert can be configured on the
              command line with <b>--certpath </b>or the macro
              %_file_signing_cert.

   <b>USING GPG TO SIGN PACKAGES</b>
       In order to sign packages using GPG, <b>rpm </b>must be configured to
       run GPG and be able to find a key ring with the appropriate keys.
       By default, <b>rpm </b>uses the same conventions as GPG to find key
       rings, namely the <b>$GNUPGHOME </b>environment variable.  If your key
       rings are not located where GPG expects them to be, you will need
       to configure the macro <b>%_gpg_path </b>to be the location of the GPG
       key rings to use.  If you want to be able to sign packages you
       create yourself, you also need to create your own public and
       secret key pair (see the GPG manual).  You will also need to
       configure the <b>rpm </b>macros

       <b>%_gpg_name</b>
              The name of the "user" whose key you wish to use to sign
              your packages.

       For example, to be able to use GPG to sign packages as the user
       <i>"John Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt;"</i> from the key rings located in
       <i>/etc/rpm/.gpg</i> using the executable <i>/usr/bin/gpg</i> you would include

              %_gpg_path /etc/rpm/.gpg
              %_gpg_name John Doe &lt;jdoe@foo.com&gt;
              %__gpg /usr/bin/gpg

       in a macro configuration file.  Use <i>/etc/rpm/macros</i> for per-
       system configuration and <i>~/.rpmmacros</i> for per-user configuration.
       Typically it's sufficient to set just %_gpg_name.
