       <b>mkfs.btrfs </b>is used to create the btrfs filesystem on a single or
       multiple devices. <i>&lt;device&gt;</i> is typically a block device but can be
       a file-backed image as well. Multiple devices are grouped by UUID
       of the filesystem.

       Before mounting such filesystem, the kernel module must know all
       the devices either via preceding execution of <b>btrfs device scan</b>
       or using the <b>device </b>mount option. See section <b>MULTIPLE DEVICES</b>
       for more details.

       The default block group profiles for data and metadata depend on
       number of devices and possibly other factors. Itâ€™s recommended to
       use specific profiles but the defaults should be OK and allowing
       future conversions to other profiles. Please see options <i>-d</i> and
       <i>-m</i> for further detals and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/btrfs-balance.8.html">btrfs-balance(8)</a> for the profile
       conversion post mkfs.
