       <b>rpmspec </b>is a tool for querying a spec file.  More specifically
       for querying hypothetical packages which would be created from
       the given spec file.  So querying a spec file with <b>rpmspec </b>is
       similar to querying a package built from that spec file.  But is
       is not identical.  With <b>rpmspec </b>you can't query all fields which
       you can query from a built package.  E.  g.  you can't query
       BUILDTIME with <b>rpmspec </b>for obvious reasons.  You also cannot
       query other fields automatically generated during a build of a
       package like auto generated dependencies.

   <b>select-options</b>
       [<b>--rpms</b>] [<b>--srpm</b>]

   <b>query-options</b>
       [<b>--qf,--queryformat </b><i>QUERYFMT</i>] [<b>--target </b><i>TARGET_PLATFORM</i>]

   <b>QUERY OPTIONS</b>
       The general form of an rpm spec query command is

       <b>rpm </b>{<b>-q|--query</b>} [<b>select-options</b>] [<b>query-options</b>]

       You may specify the format that the information should be printed
       in.  To do this, you use the

       <b>--qf|--queryformat </b><i>QUERYFMT</i>

       option, followed by the <i>QUERYFMT</i> format string.  See <b>rpm(8) </b>for
       details.

   <b>SELECT OPTIONS</b>
       <b>--rpms </b>Operate on the all binary package headers generated from
       spec.  <b>--builtrpms </b>Operate only on the binary package headers of
       packages which would be built from spec.  That means ignoring
       package headers of packages that won't be built from spec i.  e.
       ignoring package headers of packages without file section.
       <b>--srpm </b>Operate on the source package header(s) generated from
       spec.
