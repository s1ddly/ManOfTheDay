       systemd-time-wait-sync is a system service that delays the start
       of units that are ordered after time-sync.target (see
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/systemd.special.7.html">systemd.special(7)</a> for details) until the system time has been
       synchronized with an accurate remote reference time source by
       systemd-timesyncd.service.

       systemd-timesyncd.service notifies systemd-time-wait-sync about
       successful synchronization.  systemd-time-wait-sync also tries to
       detect when the kernel marks the system clock as synchronized,
       but this detection is not reliable and is intended only as a
       fallback for compatibility with alternative NTP services that can
       be used to synchronize time (e.g., ntpd, chronyd).
