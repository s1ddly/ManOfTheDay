<pre>
       <b>psfaddtable </b>takes a console font in .psf format given by <i>fontfile</i>
       and merges it with the Unicode character table given by <i>tablefile</i>
       to produce a font file with an embedded character table, which is
       written to <i>outfile</i>.  An input file name of "-" denotes standard
       input, and an output file name of "-" denotes standard output.
       If the <i>fontfile</i> already contains an embedded character table, it
       is ignored.
