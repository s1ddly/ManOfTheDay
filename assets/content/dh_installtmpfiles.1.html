       <b>dh_installtmpfiles </b>is a debhelper program that is responsible for
       installing package maintainer supplied tmpfiles.d configuration
       files (e.g. for systemd-tmpfiles).

       It also finds the tmpfiles.d configuration files installed by a
       package and generates <i>postinst</i> code blocks for activating the
       tmpfiles.d configuration when the package is installed. These
       snippets are added to the maintainer scripts by <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dh_installdeb.1.html">dh_installdeb(1)</a>.
