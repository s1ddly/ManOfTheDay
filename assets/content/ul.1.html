       <b>ul </b>reads the named files (or standard input if none are given)
       and translates occurrences of underscores to the sequence which
       indicates underlining for the terminal in use, as specified by
       the environment variable <b>TERM</b>. The <i>terminfo</i> database is read to
       determine the appropriate sequences for underlining. If the
       terminal is incapable of underlining but is capable of a standout
       mode, then that is used instead. If the terminal can overstrike,
       or handles underlining automatically, <b>ul </b>degenerates to <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/cat.1.html">cat(1)</a>.
       If the terminal cannot underline, underlining is ignored.
