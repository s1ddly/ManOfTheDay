       Creates or updates a repository with an application build.
       LOCATION is the location of the repository.  DIRECTORY must be a
       finalized build directory. If BRANCH is not specified, it is
       assumed to be "master".

       If LOCATION exists, it is assumed to be an OSTree repository,
       otherwise a new OSTree repository is created at this location.
       The repository can be inspected with the <b>ostree </b>tool.

       The contents of DIRECTORY are committed on the branch with name
       app/APPNAME/ARCH/BRANCH, where ARCH is the architecture of the
       runtime that the application is using. A commit filter is used to
       enforce that only the contents of the files/ and export/
       subdirectories and the metadata file are included in the commit,
       anything else is ignored.

       When exporting a flatpak to be published to the internet,
       <b>--collection-id=COLLECTION-ID </b>should be specified as a globally
       unique reverse DNS value to identify the collection of flatpaks
       this will be added to. Setting a globally unique collection ID
       allows the apps in the repository to be shared over peer to peer
       systems without needing further configuration.

       The build-update-repo command should be used to update repository
       metadata whenever application builds are added to a repository.
