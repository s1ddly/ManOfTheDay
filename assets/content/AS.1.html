       GNU <b>as </b>is really a family of assemblers.  If you use (or have
       used) the GNU assembler on one architecture, you should find a
       fairly similar environment when you use it on another
       architecture.  Each version has much in common with the others,
       including object file formats, most assembler directives (often
       called <i>pseudo-ops</i>) and assembler syntax.

       <b>as </b>is primarily intended to assemble the output of the GNU C
       compiler "gcc" for use by the linker "ld".  Nevertheless, we've
       tried to make <b>as </b>assemble correctly everything that other
       assemblers for the same machine would assemble.  Any exceptions
       are documented explicitly.  This doesn't mean <b>as </b>always uses the
       same syntax as another assembler for the same architecture; for
       example, we know of several incompatible versions of 680x0
       assembly language syntax.

       Each time you run <b>as </b>it assembles exactly one source program.
       The source program is made up of one or more files.  (The
       standard input is also a file.)

       You give <b>as </b>a command line that has zero or more input file
       names.  The input files are read (from left file name to right).
       A command-line argument (in any position) that has no special
       meaning is taken to be an input file name.

       If you give <b>as </b>no file names it attempts to read one input file
       from the <b>as </b>standard input, which is normally your terminal.  You
       may have to type <b>ctl-D </b>to tell <b>as </b>there is no more program to
       assemble.

       Use <b>-- </b>if you need to explicitly name the standard input file in
       your command line.

       If the source is empty, <b>as </b>produces a small, empty object file.

       <b>as </b>may write warnings and error messages to the standard error
       file (usually your terminal).  This should not happen when  a
       compiler runs <b>as </b>automatically.  Warnings report an assumption
       made so that <b>as </b>could keep assembling a flawed program; errors
       report a grave problem that stops the assembly.

       If you are invoking <b>as </b>via the GNU C compiler, you can use the
       <b>-Wa </b>option to pass arguments through to the assembler.  The
       assembler arguments must be separated from each other (and the
       <b>-Wa</b>) by commas.  For example:

               gcc -c -g -O -Wa,-alh,-L file.c

       This passes two options to the assembler: <b>-alh </b>(emit a listing to
       standard output with high-level and assembly source) and <b>-L</b>
       (retain local symbols in the symbol table).

       Usually you do not need to use this <b>-Wa </b>mechanism, since many
       compiler command-line options are automatically passed to the
       assembler by the compiler.  (You can call the GNU compiler driver
       with the <b>-v </b>option to see precisely what options it passes to
       each compilation pass, including the assembler.)
