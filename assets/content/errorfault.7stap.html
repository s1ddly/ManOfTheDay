       Read or write faults can occur during the operation of a
       systemtap script, if the script causes dereferencing of a pointer
       that turns out to be invalid.  This can be caused by using
       context variables that do not happen to have valid values, or
       perhaps references to memory that is unavailable at that moment
       due to paging.

       These fault conditions are benign because they are caught by the
       systemtap runtime, which cleanly terminates the script.  If quick
       termination is not desired, consider using the <i>--skip-badvars</i> or
       <i>--suppress-handler-errors</i> or <i>-DMAXERRORS=NN</i> stap options, or
       wrapping relevant parts of the probe handlers in a <i>try</i>/<i>catch</i>
       block.

       It may be possible to adjust the target program, to make it more
       likely that needed context variables are paged in when systemtap
       looks for them.  Consider adding some lightweight processing on
       the key variables, like a <i>strlen(foo)</i> for a string, or iterating
       across elements of an array or linked list, or touching a few
       bytes of a heap-allocated block.  The idea is to trigger any page
       faults in the target program, before systemtap would need to (but
       can't).
