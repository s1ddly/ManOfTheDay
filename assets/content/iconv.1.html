       The <b>iconv </b>program reads in text in one encoding and outputs the
       text in another encoding.  If no input files are given, or if it
       is given as a dash (-), <b>iconv </b>reads from standard input.  If no
       output file is given, <b>iconv </b>writes to standard output.

       If no <i>from-encoding</i> is given, the default is derived from the
       current locale's character encoding.  If no <i>to-encoding</i> is given,
       the default is derived from the current locale's character
       encoding.
