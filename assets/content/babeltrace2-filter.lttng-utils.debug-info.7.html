       A Babeltrace 2 <b>filter.lttng-utils.debug-info </b>message iterator
       creates and emits copies of upstream messages, augmenting LTTng
       event messages with debugging information when it’s available and
       possible.

       See <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/babeltrace2-intro.7.html">babeltrace2-intro(7)</a> to learn more about the Babeltrace 2
       project and its core concepts.

       A <b>filter.lttng-utils.debug-info </b>message iterator uses the LTTng
       state dump events as well as the event common context’s <b>ip</b>
       (instruction pointer) and <b>vpid </b>(process ID) fields to locate and
       read the corresponding debugging information. The message
       iterator can find the extra debugging information in an
       executable file or in a directory containing debugging
       information which the compiler creates.

       The new LTTng events (copies of the original ones with added
       debugging information) contain, when possible, a new event common
       context’s structure field (besides the <b>ip </b>field) named <b>debug_info</b>
       by default (you can use the <b>debug-info-field-name </b>parameter to
       choose another name). This structure field contains the following
       fields:

       <b>bin </b>[string]
           Executable path or name followed with <b>@ADDR </b>or <b>+ADDR</b>, where
           <b>ADDR </b>is the address (hexadecimal) where it was loaded while
           being traced.

           <b>@ADDR </b>means <b>ADDR </b>is an absolute address, and <b>+ADDR </b>means <b>ADDR</b>
           is a relative address.

           Examples: <b>my-program@0x4b7fdd23</b>, <b>my-program+0x18d7c</b>.

       <b>func </b>[string]
           Function name followed with <b>+OFFSET</b>, where <b>OFFSET </b>is the
           offset (hexadecimal) from the beginning of the function
           symbol in the executable file.

           Example: <b>load_user_config+0x194</b>.

       <b>src </b>[string]
           Source file path or name followed with <b>:LINE</b>, where <b>LINE </b>is
           the line number in this source file at which the event
           occurred.

           Example: <b>user-config.c:1025</b>.

       Any of the previous fields can be an empty string if the
       debugging information was not available for the analyzed original
       LTTng event.

       A <b>filter.lttng-utils.debug-info </b>message iterator systematically
       copies the upstream messages, but it only augments compatible
       LTTng event classes. This means that the message iterator copies
       messages of non-LTTng trace (see “LTTng prerequisites”) without
       alteration.

   <b>Compile an executable for debugging information analysis</b>
       With GCC or Clang, you need to compile the program or library
       source files in debug mode with the <b>-g </b>option. This option makes
       the compiler generate debugging information in the operating
       system’s native format. This format is recognized by a
       <b>filter.lttng-utils.debug-info </b>component: it can translate the
       instruction pointer field of an event’s common context to a
       source file and line number, along with the name of the
       surrounding function.

           <b>Important</b>
           This component class only supports the debugging information
           in DWARF format, version 2 or later. Use the <b>-gdwarf </b>or
           <b>-gdwarf-VERSION </b>(where <b>VERSION </b>is the DWARF version) compiler
           options to explicitly generate DWARF debugging information.

       If you don’t compile the executable’s source files with the <b>-g</b>
       option or with an equivalent option, no DWARF information is
       available: the message iterator uses ELF symbols from the
       executable file instead. In this case, the events that the
       message iterator creates do not contain the source file and line
       number (see the <b>src </b>field), but only the name of the nearest
       function symbol with an offset in bytes to the location in the
       executable from which the LTTng event occurred (see the <b>func</b>
       field).

       If the executable file has neither ELF symbols nor DWARF
       information, the <b>filter.lttng-utils.debug-info </b>message iterator
       cannot map the event to its source location: the message iterator
       still copies the upstream messages but without altering them.

   <b>LTTng prerequisites</b>
       A <b>filter.lttng-utils.debug-info </b>message iterator can only analyze
       user space events which LTTng (see &lt;<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pagestps://lttng.org">https://lttng.org</a>&gt;) 2.8.0 or
       later generates.

       To get debugging information for LTTng-UST events which occur in
       executables and libraries which the system’s loader loads (what
       you can see with <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ldd.1.html">ldd(1)</a>):

        1. Add the <b>ip </b>and <b>vpid </b>context fields to user space event
           records:

               $ lttng add-context --userspace --type=ip --type=vpid

           See <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/lttng-add-context.1.html">lttng-add-context(1)</a> for more details.

        2. Enable the LTTng-UST state dump events:

               $ lttng enable-event --userspace 'lttng_ust_statedump:*'

           See <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/lttng-enable-event.1.html">lttng-enable-event(1)</a> and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/lttng-ust.3.html">lttng-ust(3)</a> for more details.

       To get debugging information for LTTng-UST events which occur in
       dynamically loaded objects, for example plugins:

        1. Do the previous steps (add context fields and enable the
           LTTng-UST state dump events).

        2. Enable the LTTng-UST dynamic linker tracing helper events:

               $ lttng enable-event --userspace 'lttng_ust_dl:*'

           See <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/lttng-ust-dl.3.html">lttng-ust-dl(3)</a> for more details.

        3. When you are ready to trace, start your application with the
           <b>LD_PRELOAD </b>environment variable set to <b>liblttng-ust-dl.so</b>:

               $ LD_PRELOAD=liblttng-ust-dl.so my-app

   <b>Separate debugging information</b>
       You can store DWARF debugging information outside the executable
       itself, whether it is to reduce the executable’s file size or
       simply to facilitate sharing the debugging information.

       This is usually achieved via one of two mechanisms, namely <i>build</i>
       <i>ID</i> and <i>debug link</i>. Their use and operation is described in the
       Debugging Information in Separate Files (see
       &lt;https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Separate-Debug-
       Files.html&gt;) section of GDB’s documentation.

       A <b>filter.lttng-utils.debug-info </b>message iterator can find
       separate debugging information files automatically, as long as
       they meet the requirements stated in this manual page.

       The debugging information lookup order is the same as GDB’s,
       namely:

        1. Within the executable file itself.

        2. Through the build ID method in the <b>/usr/lib/debug/.build-id</b>
           directory.

        3. In the various possible debug link locations.

       The message iterator uses the first debugging information file
       that it finds.

       You can use the <b>debug-info-dir </b>initialization parameter to
       override the default <b>/usr/lib/debug </b>directory used in the build
       ID and debug link methods.

           <b>Note</b>
           It is currently not possible to make this component search
           for debugging information in multiple directories.

   <b>Target prefix</b>
       The debugging information analysis that a <b>filter.lttng-</b>
       <b>utils.debug-info </b>message iterator performs uses the paths to the
       executables as collected during tracing as the default mechanism
       to resolve DWARF and ELF information.

       If the trace was recorded on a separate machine, however, you can
       use the <b>target-prefix </b>parameter to specify a prefix directory,
       that is, the root of the target file system.

       For example, if an instrumented executable’s path is <b>/usr/bin/foo</b>
       on the target system, you can place this file at
       <b>/home/user/target/usr/bin/foo </b>on the system on which you use a
       <b>filter.lttng-utils.debug-info </b>component. In this case, the target
       prefix to use is <b>/home/user/target</b>.
