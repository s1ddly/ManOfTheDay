     The <b>sendmail </b>utility is a local enqueuer for the smtpd(8) daemon,
     compatible with mailwrapper(8).  The message is read on standard
     input (stdin) until <b>sendmail </b>encounters an end-of-file.  The
     <b>sendmail </b>enqueuer is not intended to be used directly to send mail,
     but rather via a frontend known as a mail user agent.

     Unless the optional <b>-t </b>flag is specified, one or more recipients
     must be specified on the command line.

     The options are as follows:

     <b>-F </b><i>name</i>
             Set the sender's full name.

     <b>-f </b><i>from</i>
             Set the sender's address.

     <b>-t      </b>Read the message's To:, Cc:, and Bcc: fields for
             recipients.  The Bcc: field will be deleted before sending.

     <b>-v      </b>Enable verbose output.

     To maintain compatibility with Sendmail, Inc.'s implementation of
     <b>sendmail</b>, various other flags are accepted, but have no effect.
