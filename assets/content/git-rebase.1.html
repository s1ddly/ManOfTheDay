       If &lt;branch&gt; is specified, <i>git rebase</i> will perform an automatic
       <b>git switch &lt;branch&gt; </b>before doing anything else. Otherwise it
       remains on the current branch.

       If &lt;upstream&gt; is not specified, the upstream configured in
       branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote and branch.&lt;name&gt;.merge options will be used
       (see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/git-config.1.html">git-config(1)</a> for details) and the <b>--fork-point </b>option is
       assumed. If you are currently not on any branch or if the current
       branch does not have a configured upstream, the rebase will
       abort.

       All changes made by commits in the current branch but that are
       not in &lt;upstream&gt; are saved to a temporary area. This is the same
       set of commits that would be shown by <b>git log &lt;upstream&gt;..HEAD</b>;
       or by <b>git log 'fork_point'..HEAD</b>, if <b>--fork-point </b>is active (see
       the description on <b>--fork-point </b>below); or by <b>git log HEAD</b>, if
       the <b>--root </b>option is specified.

       The current branch is reset to &lt;upstream&gt;, or &lt;newbase&gt; if the
       --onto option was supplied. This has the exact same effect as <b>git</b>
       <b>reset --hard &lt;upstream&gt; </b>(or &lt;newbase&gt;). ORIG_HEAD is set to point
       at the tip of the branch before the reset.

       The commits that were previously saved into the temporary area
       are then reapplied to the current branch, one by one, in order.
       Note that any commits in HEAD which introduce the same textual
       changes as a commit in HEAD..&lt;upstream&gt; are omitted (i.e., a
       patch already accepted upstream with a different commit message
       or timestamp will be skipped).

       It is possible that a merge failure will prevent this process
       from being completely automatic. You will have to resolve any
       such merge failure and run <b>git rebase --continue</b>. Another option
       is to bypass the commit that caused the merge failure with <b>git</b>
       <b>rebase --skip</b>. To check out the original &lt;branch&gt; and remove the
       .git/rebase-apply working files, use the command <b>git rebase</b>
       <b>--abort </b>instead.

       Assume the following history exists and the current branch is
       "topic":

                     A---B---C topic
                    /
               D---E---F---G master

       From this point, the result of either of the following commands:

           git rebase master
           git rebase master topic

       would be:

                             A'--B'--C' topic
                            /
               D---E---F---G master

       <b>NOTE: </b>The latter form is just a short-hand of <b>git checkout topic</b>
       followed by <b>git rebase master</b>. When rebase exits <b>topic </b>will
       remain the checked-out branch.

       If the upstream branch already contains a change you have made
       (e.g., because you mailed a patch which was applied upstream),
       then that commit will be skipped. For example, running <b>git rebase</b>
       <b>master </b>on the following history (in which <b>A' </b>and <b>A </b>introduce the
       same set of changes, but have different committer information):

                     A---B---C topic
                    /
               D---E---A'---F master

       will result in:

                              B'---C' topic
                             /
               D---E---A'---F master

       Here is how you would transplant a topic branch based on one
       branch to another, to pretend that you forked the topic branch
       from the latter branch, using <b>rebase --onto</b>.

       First letâ€™s assume your <i>topic</i> is based on branch <i>next</i>. For
       example, a feature developed in <i>topic</i> depends on some
       functionality which is found in <i>next</i>.

               o---o---o---o---o  master
                    \
                     o---o---o---o---o  next
                                      \
                                       o---o---o  topic

       We want to make <i>topic</i> forked from branch <i>master</i>; for example,
       because the functionality on which <i>topic</i> depends was merged into
       the more stable <i>master</i> branch. We want our tree to look like
       this:

               o---o---o---o---o  master
                   |            \
                   |             o'--o'--o'  topic
                    \
                     o---o---o---o---o  next

       We can get this using the following command:

           git rebase --onto master next topic

       Another example of --onto option is to rebase part of a branch.
       If we have the following situation:

                                       H---I---J topicB
                                      /
                             E---F---G  topicA
                            /
               A---B---C---D  master

       then the command

           git rebase --onto master topicA topicB

       would result in:

                            H'--I'--J'  topicB
                           /
                           | E---F---G  topicA
                           |/
               A---B---C---D  master

       This is useful when topicB does not depend on topicA.

       A range of commits could also be removed with rebase. If we have
       the following situation:

               E---F---G---H---I---J  topicA

       then the command

           git rebase --onto topicA~5 topicA~3 topicA

       would result in the removal of commits F and G:

               E---H'---I'---J'  topicA

       This is useful if F and G were flawed in some way, or should not
       be part of topicA. Note that the argument to --onto and the
       &lt;upstream&gt; parameter can be any valid commit-ish.

       In case of conflict, <i>git rebase</i> will stop at the first
       problematic commit and leave conflict markers in the tree. You
       can use <i>git diff</i> to locate the markers (&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;) and make edits to
       resolve the conflict. For each file you edit, you need to tell
       Git that the conflict has been resolved, typically this would be
       done with

           git add &lt;filename&gt;

       After resolving the conflict manually and updating the index with
       the desired resolution, you can continue the rebasing process
       with

           git rebase --continue

       Alternatively, you can undo the <i>git rebase</i> with

           git rebase --abort
