       <b>myisam_ftdump </b>displays information about FULLTEXT indexes in
       MyISAM tables. It reads the MyISAM index file directly, so it
       must be run on the server host where the table is located. Before
       using <b>myisam_ftdump</b>, be sure to issue a FLUSH TABLES statement
       first if the server is running.

       <b>myisam_ftdump </b>scans and dumps the entire index, which is not
       particularly fast. On the other hand, the distribution of words
       changes infrequently, so it need not be run often.

       Invoke <b>myisam_ftdump </b>like this:

           shell&gt; <b>myisam_ftdump [</b><i>options</i><b>] </b><i>tbl_name index_num</i>

       The <i>tbl_name</i> argument should be the name of a MyISAM table. You
       can also specify a table by naming its index file (the file with
       the .MYI suffix). If you do not invoke <b>myisam_ftdump </b>in the
       directory where the table files are located, the table or index
       file name must be preceded by the path name to the table´s
       database directory. Index numbers begin with 0.

       Example: Suppose that the test database contains a table named
       mytexttablel that has the following definition:

           CREATE TABLE mytexttable
           (
             id   INT NOT NULL,
             txt  TEXT NOT NULL,
             PRIMARY KEY (id),
             FULLTEXT (txt)
           );

       The index on id is index 0 and the FULLTEXT index on txt is index
       1. If your working directory is the test database directory,
       invoke <b>myisam_ftdump </b>as follows:

           shell&gt; <b>myisam_ftdump mytexttable 1</b>

       If the path name to the test database directory is
       /usr/local/mysql/data/test, you can also specify the table name
       argument using that path name. This is useful if you do not
       invoke <b>myisam_ftdump </b>in the database directory:

           shell&gt; <b>myisam_ftdump /usr/local/mysql/data/test/mytexttable 1</b>

       You can use <b>myisam_ftdump </b>to generate a list of index entries in
       order of frequency of occurrence like this:

           shell&gt; <b>myisam_ftdump -c mytexttable 1 | sort -r</b>

       <b>myisam_ftdump </b>supports the following options:

       •   <b>--help</b>, <b>-h -?</b>

           Display a help message and exit.

       •   <b>--count</b>, <b>-c</b>

           Calculate per-word statistics (counts and global weights).

       •   <b>--dump</b>, <b>-d</b>

           Dump the index, including data offsets and word weights.

       •   <b>--length</b>, <b>-l</b>

           Report the length distribution.

       •   <b>--stats</b>, <b>-s</b>

           Report global index statistics. This is the default operation
           if no other operation is specified.

       •   <b>--verbose</b>, <b>-v</b>

           Verbose mode. Print more output about what the program does.
