       <b>sar2pcp </b>is intended to read a binary System Activity Reporting
       (sar) data file as created by <b>sadc</b>(1) (<i>infile</i>) and translate this
       into a Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) archive with the basename
       <i>outfile</i>.

       However, if <i>infile</i> has the suffix ``.xml'', then it will be
       considered already in XML format and <b>sar2pcp </b>will operate
       directly on it.

       The resultant PCP achive may be used with all the PCP client
       tools to graph subsets of the data using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmchart.1.html">pmchart(1)</a>, perform data
       reduction and reporting, filter with the PCP inference engine
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmie.1.html">pmie(1)</a>, etc.

       A series of physical files will be created with the prefix
       <i>outfile</i>.  These are <i>outfile</i><b>.0 </b>(the performance data),
       <i>outfile</i><b>.meta </b>(the metadata that describes the performance data)
       and <i>outfile</i><b>.index </b>(a temporal index to improve efficiency of
       replay operations for the archive).  If any of these files exists
       already, then <b>sar2pcp </b>will <b>not </b>overwrite them and will exit with
       an error message of the form

       __pmLogNewFile: ``blah.0'' already exists, not over-written

       <b>sar2pcp </b>is a Perl script that uses the PCP::LogImport Perl
       wrapper around the PCP <i>libpcp_import</i> library, and as such could
       be used as an example to develop new tools to import other types
       of performance data and create PCP archives.  A Python wrapper
       module is also available.
