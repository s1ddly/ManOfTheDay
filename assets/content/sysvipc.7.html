       System V IPC is the name given to three interprocess
       communication mechanisms that are widely available on UNIX
       systems: message queues, semaphore, and shared memory.

   <b>Message queues</b>
       System V message queues allow data to be exchanged in units
       called messages.  Each messages can have an associated priority,
       POSIX message queues provide an alternative API for achieving the
       same result; see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/mq_overview.7.html">mq_overview(7)</a>.

       The System V message queue API consists of the following system
       calls:

       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/msgget.2.html">msgget(2)</a>
              Create a new message queue or obtain the ID of an existing
              message queue.  This call returns an identifier that is
              used in the remaining APIs.

       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/msgsnd.2.html">msgsnd(2)</a>
              Add a message to a queue.

       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/msgrcv.2.html">msgrcv(2)</a>
              Remove a message from a queue.

       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/msgctl.2.html">msgctl(2)</a>
              Perform various control operations on a queue, including
              deletion.

   <b>Semaphore sets</b>
       System V semaphores allow processes to synchronize their actions.
       System V semaphores are allocated in groups called sets; each
       semaphore in a set is a counting semaphore.  POSIX semaphores
       provide an alternative API for achieving the same result; see
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/sem_overview.7.html">sem_overview(7)</a>.

       The System V semaphore API consists of the following system
       calls:

       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/semget.2.html">semget(2)</a>
              Create a new set or obtain the ID of an existing set.
              This call returns an identifier that is used in the
              remaining APIs.

       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/semop.2.html">semop(2)</a>
              Perform operations on the semaphores in a set.

       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/semctl.2.html">semctl(2)</a>
              Perform various control operations on a set, including
              deletion.

   <b>Shared memory segments</b>
       System V shared memory allows processes to share a region a
       memory (a "segment").  POSIX shared memory is an alternative API
       for achieving the same result; see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/shm_overview.7.html">shm_overview(7)</a>.

       The System V shared memory API consists of the following system
       calls:

       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/shmget.2.html">shmget(2)</a>
              Create a new segment or obtain the ID of an existing
              segment.  This call returns an identifier that is used in
              the remaining APIs.

       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/shmat.2.html">shmat(2)</a>
              Attach an existing shared memory object into the calling
              process's address space.

       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/shmdt.2.html">shmdt(2)</a>
              Detach a segment from the calling process's address space.

       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/shmctl.2.html">shmctl(2)</a>
              Perform various control operations on a segment, including
              deletion.

   <b>IPC namespaces</b>
       For a discussion of the interaction of System V IPC objects and
       IPC namespaces, see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/ipc_namespaces.7.html">ipc_namespaces(7)</a>.
