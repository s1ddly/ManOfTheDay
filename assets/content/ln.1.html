       In the 1st form, create a link to TARGET with the name LINK_NAME.
       In the 2nd form, create a link to TARGET in the current
       directory.  In the 3rd and 4th forms, create links to each TARGET
       in DIRECTORY.  Create hard links by default, symbolic links with
       <b>--symbolic</b>.  By default, each destination (name of new link)
       should not already exist.  When creating hard links, each TARGET
       must exist.  Symbolic links can hold arbitrary text; if later
       resolved, a relative link is interpreted in relation to its
       parent directory.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short
       options too.

       <b>--backup</b>[=<i>CONTROL</i>]
              make a backup of each existing destination file

       <b>-b     </b>like <b>--backup </b>but does not accept an argument

       <b>-d</b>, <b>-F</b>, <b>--directory</b>
              allow the superuser to attempt to hard link directories
              (note: will probably fail due to system restrictions, even
              for the superuser)

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--force</b>
              remove existing destination files

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--interactive</b>
              prompt whether to remove destinations

       <b>-L</b>, <b>--logical</b>
              dereference TARGETs that are symbolic links

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--no-dereference</b>
              treat LINK_NAME as a normal file if it is a symbolic link
              to a directory

       <b>-P</b>, <b>--physical</b>
              make hard links directly to symbolic links

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--relative</b>
              create symbolic links relative to link location

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--symbolic</b>
              make symbolic links instead of hard links

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--suffix</b>=<i>SUFFIX</i>
              override the usual backup suffix

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--target-directory</b>=<i>DIRECTORY</i>
              specify the DIRECTORY in which to create the links

       <b>-T</b>, <b>--no-target-directory</b>
              treat LINK_NAME as a normal file always

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              print name of each linked file

       <b>--help </b>display this help and exit

       <b>--version</b>
              output version information and exit

       The backup suffix is '~', unless set with <b>--suffix </b>or
       SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX.  The version control method may be selected
       via the <b>--backup </b>option or through the VERSION_CONTROL
       environment variable.  Here are the values:

       none, off
              never make backups (even if <b>--backup </b>is given)

       numbered, t
              make numbered backups

       existing, nil
              numbered if numbered backups exist, simple otherwise

       simple, never
              always make simple backups

       Using <b>-s </b>ignores <b>-L </b>and <b>-P</b>.  Otherwise, the last option specified
       controls behavior when a TARGET is a symbolic link, defaulting to
       <b>-P</b>.
