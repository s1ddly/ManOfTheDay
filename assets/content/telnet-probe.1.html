       <b>telnet-probe </b>allows the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmdashping.1.html">pmdashping(1)</a> daemons to establish
       connections to arbitrary local and remote service-providing
       daemons so that response time and service availability
       information can be obtained.

       The required <i>host</i> and <i>port</i> number arguments have the same meaning
       as their <b>telnet</b>(1) equivalents.

       The <b>-c </b>option causes <b>telnet-probe </b>to perform a <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/connect.2.html">connect(2)</a> only.
       This skips the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/read.2.html">read(2)</a> and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/write.2.html">write(2)</a> exercise that would otherwise
       be done after connecting (see below).

       Once the telnet connection has been established, <b>telnet-probe</b>
       reads from <i>stdin</i> until end-of-file, and writes all the input data
       to the telnet connection.  Next, <b>telnet-probe </b>will read from the
       telnet connection until end-of-file, discarding whatever data it
       receives.  Then <b>telnet-probe </b>exits.

       To operate successfully, the input passed via <b>telnet-probe </b>to the
       remote service must be sufficient to cause the remote service to
       close the connection when the last line of input has been
       processed, e.g. ending with ``quit'' when probing SMTP on port
       25.

       By default <b>telnet-probe </b>will not produce any output, unless there
       is an error in which case a diagnostic message can be displayed
       (in verbose mode only) and the exit status will be non-zero
       indicating a failure.
