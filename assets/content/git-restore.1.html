       Restore specified paths in the working tree with some contents
       from a restore source. If a path is tracked but does not exist in
       the restore source, it will be removed to match the source.

       The command can also be used to restore the content in the index
       with <b>--staged</b>, or restore both the working tree and the index
       with <b>--staged --worktree</b>.

       By default, if <b>--staged </b>is given, the contents are restored from
       <b>HEAD</b>, otherwise from the index. Use <b>--source </b>to restore from a
       different commit.

       See "Reset, restore and revert" in <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/git.1.html">git(1)</a> for the differences
       between the three commands.

       THIS COMMAND IS EXPERIMENTAL. THE BEHAVIOR MAY CHANGE.
