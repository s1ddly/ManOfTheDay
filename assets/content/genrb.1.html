       <b>genrb </b>converts the resource <i>bundle</i> source files passed on the
       command line to their binary form or to a Java source file for
       use with ICU4J.  The resulting binary files have a <b>.res </b>extension
       while resource bundle source files typically have a <b>.txt</b>
       extension. Java source files have a <b>java </b>extension and follow the
       ICU4J naming conventions.

       It is customary to name the resource bundles by their locale
       name, i.e. to use a local identifier for the <i>bundle</i> filename,
       e.g.  <b>ja_JP.txt </b>for Japanese (Japan) data, or <b>root.txt </b>for the
       root bundle.  In any case, <b>genrb </b>will produce a file whose base
       name is the name of the locale found in the resource file, not
       the base name of the resource file itself.

       The binary files can be read directly by ICU, or used by
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pkgdata.1.html">pkgdata(1)</a> for incorporation into a larger archive or library.
