       Compares the content and mode of the blobs found via two tree
       objects.

       If there is only one &lt;tree-ish&gt; given, the commit is compared
       with its parents (see --stdin below).

       Note that <i>git diff-tree</i> can use the tree encapsulated in a commit
       object.
