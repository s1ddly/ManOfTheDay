       <b>@CLEAR@ </b>clears your screen if this is possible, including its
       scrollback buffer (if the extended “E3” capability is defined).
       <b>@CLEAR@ </b>looks in the environment for the terminal type given by
       the environment variable <b>TERM</b>, and then in the <b>terminfo </b>database
       to determine how to clear the screen.

       <b>@CLEAR@ </b>writes to the standard output.  You can redirect the
       standard output to a file (which prevents <b>@CLEAR@ </b>from actually
       clearing the screen), and later <b>cat </b>the file to the screen,
       clearing it at that point.
