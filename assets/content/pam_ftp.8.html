       pam_ftp is a PAM module which provides a pluggable anonymous ftp
       mode of access.

       This module intercepts the user's name and password. If the name
       is <i>ftp</i> or <i>anonymous</i>, the user's password is broken up at the <i>@</i>
       delimiter into a <i>PAM_RUSER</i> and a <i>PAM_RHOST</i> part; these pam-items
       being set accordingly. The username (<i>PAM_USER</i>) is set to <i>ftp</i>. In
       this case the module succeeds. Alternatively, the module sets the
       <i>PAM_AUTHTOK</i> item with the entered password and fails.

       This module is not safe and easily spoofable.
