<pre>
       Long ago, in UNIX V6, there was a program <i>/etc/glob</i> that would
       expand wildcard patterns.  Soon afterward this became a shell
       built-in.

       These days there is also a library routine <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/glob.3.html">glob(3)</a> that will
       perform this function for a user program.

       The rules are as follows (POSIX.2, 3.13).

   <b>Wildcard matching</b>
       A string is a wildcard pattern if it contains one of the
       characters '?', '*', or '['.  Globbing is the operation that
       expands a wildcard pattern into the list of pathnames matching
       the pattern.  Matching is defined by:

       A '?' (not between brackets) matches any single character.

       A '*' (not between brackets) matches any string, including the
       empty string.

       <b>Character classes</b>

       An expression "<i>[...]</i>" where the first character after the leading
       '[' is not an '!' matches a single character, namely any of the
       characters enclosed by the brackets.  The string enclosed by the
       brackets cannot be empty; therefore ']' can be allowed between
       the brackets, provided that it is the first character.  (Thus,
       "<i>[][!]</i>" matches the three characters '[', ']', and '!'.)

       <b>Ranges</b>

       There is one special convention: two characters separated by '-'
       denote a range.  (Thus, "<i>[A-Fa-f0-9]</i>" is equivalent to
       "<i>[ABCDEFabcdef0123456789]</i>".)  One may include '-' in its literal
       meaning by making it the first or last character between the
       brackets.  (Thus, "<i>[]-]</i>" matches just the two characters ']' and
       '-', and "<i>[--0]</i>" matches the three characters '-', '.', '0',
       since '/' cannot be matched.)

       <b>Complementation</b>

       An expression "<i>[!...]</i>" matches a single character, namely any
       character that is not matched by the expression obtained by
       removing the first '!' from it.  (Thus, "<i>[!]a-]</i>" matches any
       single character except ']', 'a', and '-'.)

       One can remove the special meaning of '?', '*', and '[' by
       preceding them by a backslash, or, in case this is part of a
       shell command line, enclosing them in quotes.  Between brackets
       these characters stand for themselves.  Thus, "<i>[[?*\]</i>" matches
       the four characters '[', '?', '*', and '\'.

   <b>Pathnames</b>
       Globbing is applied on each of the components of a pathname
       separately.  A '/' in a pathname cannot be matched by a '?' or
       '*' wildcard, or by a range like "<i>[.-0]</i>".  A range containing an
       explicit '/' character is syntactically incorrect.  (POSIX
       requires that syntactically incorrect patterns are left
       unchanged.)

       If a filename starts with a '.', this character must be matched
       explicitly.  (Thus, <i>rm *</i> will not remove .profile, and <i>tar c *</i>
       will not archive all your files; <i>tar c .</i> is better.)

   <b>Empty lists</b>
       The nice and simple rule given above: "expand a wildcard pattern
       into the list of matching pathnames" was the original UNIX
       definition.  It allowed one to have patterns that expand into an
       empty list, as in

           xv -wait 0 *.gif *.jpg

       where perhaps no *.gif files are present (and this is not an
       error).  However, POSIX requires that a wildcard pattern is left
       unchanged when it is syntactically incorrect, or the list of
       matching pathnames is empty.  With <i>bash</i> one can force the
       classical behavior using this command:

           shopt -s nullglob

       (Similar problems occur elsewhere.  For example, where old
       scripts have

           rm `find . -name "*~"`

       new scripts require

           rm -f nosuchfile `find . -name "*~"`

       to avoid error messages from <i>rm</i> called with an empty argument
       list.)
