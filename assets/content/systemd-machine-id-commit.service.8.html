       systemd-machine-id-commit.service is an early boot service
       responsible for committing transient /etc/machine-id files to a
       writable disk file system. See <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/machine-id.5.html">machine-id(5)</a> for more information
       about machine IDs.

       This service is started after local-fs.target in case
       /etc/machine-id is a mount point of its own (usually from a
       memory file system such as "tmpfs") and /etc is writable. The
       service will invoke <b>systemd-machine-id-setup --commit</b>, which
       writes the current transient machine ID to disk and unmount the
       /etc/machine-id file in a race-free manner to ensure that file is
       always valid and accessible for other processes. See
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/systemd-machine-id-setup.1.html">systemd-machine-id-setup(1)</a> for details.

       The main use case of this service are systems where
       /etc/machine-id is read-only and initially not initialized. In
       this case, the system manager will generate a transient machine
       ID file on a memory file system, and mount it over
       /etc/machine-id, during the early boot phase. This service is
       then invoked in a later boot phase, as soon as /etc/ has been
       remounted writable and the ID may thus be committed to disk to
       make it permanent.
