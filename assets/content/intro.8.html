       Section 8 of the manual describes commands which either can be or
       are used only by the superuser, like system-administration
       commands, daemons, and hardware-related commands.

       described in this section terminate with an exit status that
       indicates whether the command succeeded or failed.  See <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/intro.1.html">intro(1)</a>
