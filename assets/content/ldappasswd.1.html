       <b>ldappasswd </b>is a tool to set the password of an LDAP user.
       <b>ldappasswd </b>uses the LDAPv3 Password Modify (RFC 3062) extended
       operation.

       <b>ldappasswd </b>sets the password of associated with the user [or an
       optionally specified <i>user</i>].  If the new password is not specified
       on the command line and the user doesn't enable prompting, the
       server will be asked to generate a password for the user.

       <b>ldappasswd </b>is neither designed nor intended to be a replacement
       for <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/passwd.1.html">passwd(1)</a> and should not be installed as such.
