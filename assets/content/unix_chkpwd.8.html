       <i>unix_chkpwd</i> is a helper program for the <i>pam_unix</i> module that
       verifies the password of the current user. It also checks
       password and account expiration dates in <i>shadow</i>. It is not
       intended to be run directly from the command line and logs a
       security violation if done so.

       It is typically installed setuid root or setgid shadow.

       The interface of the helper - command line options, and
       input/output data format are internal to the <i>pam_unix</i> module and
       it should not be called directly from applications.
