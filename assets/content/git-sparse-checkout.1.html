       Initialize and modify the sparse-checkout configuration, which
       reduces the checkout to a set of paths given by a list of
       patterns.

       THIS COMMAND IS EXPERIMENTAL. ITS BEHAVIOR, AND THE BEHAVIOR OF
       OTHER COMMANDS IN THE PRESENCE OF SPARSE-CHECKOUTS, WILL LIKELY
       CHANGE IN THE FUTURE.
