       The <i>file</i> utility shall perform a series of tests in sequence on
       each specified <i>file</i> in an attempt to classify it:

        1. If <i>file</i> does not exist, cannot be read, or its file status
           could not be determined, the output shall indicate that the
           file was processed, but that its type could not be
           determined.

        2. If the file is not a regular file, its file type shall be
           identified.  The file types directory, FIFO, socket, block
           special, and character special shall be identified as such.
           Other implementation-defined file types may also be
           identified. If <i>file</i> is a symbolic link, by default the link
           shall be resolved and <i>file</i> shall test the type of file
           referenced by the symbolic link. (See the <b>-h </b>and <b>-i </b>options
           below.)

        3. If the length of <i>file</i> is zero, it shall be identified as an
           empty file.

        4. The <i>file</i> utility shall examine an initial segment of <i>file</i> and
           shall make a guess at identifying its contents based on
           position-sensitive tests. (The answer is not guaranteed to be
           correct; see the <b>-d</b>, <b>-M</b>, and <b>-m </b>options below.)

        5. The <i>file</i> utility shall examine <i>file</i> and make a guess at
           identifying its contents based on context-sensitive default
           system tests. (The answer is not guaranteed to be correct.)

        6. The file shall be identified as a data file.

       If <i>file</i> does not exist, cannot be read, or its file status could
       not be determined, the output shall indicate that the file was
       processed, but that its type could not be determined.

       If <i>file</i> is a symbolic link, by default the link shall be resolved
       and <i>file</i> shall test the type of file referenced by the symbolic
       link.
