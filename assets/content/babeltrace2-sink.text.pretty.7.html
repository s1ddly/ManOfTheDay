       A Babeltrace 2 <b>sink.text.pretty </b>component pretty-prints the
       events, discarded events, and discarded packets messages it
       consumes to the standard output or to a file.

                       +------------------+
                       | sink.text.pretty |
                       |                  +--&gt; Pretty-printed messages to
           Messages --&gt;@ in               |    the standard output or a file and
                       +------------------+    to the standard error

       See <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/babeltrace2-intro.7.html">babeltrace2-intro(7)</a> to learn more about the Babeltrace 2
       project and its core concepts.

       By default, a <b>sink.text.pretty </b>component pretty-prints to the
       standard output. You can use the <b>path </b>parameter to make the
       component write to a file instead.

       The component prints warnings on the standard error stream when
       it consumes a discarded events or discarded packets message.

       If you don’t use the <b>path </b>parameter and the application’s
       standard output is connected to a color-capable terminal, the
       component emits terminal color codes to enhance the text output.
       You can use the <b>color </b>parameter to force the color support or to
       disable it.

       This component class is equivalent to the <b>text </b>output format of
       <b>babeltrace</b>(1) (Babeltrace 1 command-line tool).
