       <i>lookbib</i> prints a prompt on the standard error (unless the
       standard input is not a terminal), reads from the standard input
       a line containing a set of keywords, searches the bibliographic
       databases <i>filename</i> ... for references containing those keywords,
       prints any references found on the standard output, and repeats
       this process until the end of input.  For each database <i>filename</i>
       to be searched, if an index filename<i>.i</i> created by <i>indxbib</i>(1)
       exists, then it will be searched instead; each index can cover
       multiple databases.
