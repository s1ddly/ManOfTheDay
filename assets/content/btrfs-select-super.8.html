       Destructively overwrite all copies of the superblock with a
       specified copy. This helps in certain cases, for example when
       write barriers were disabled during a power failure and not all
       superblocks were written, or if the primary superblock is
       damaged, eg. accidentally overwritten.

       The filesystem specified by <i>device</i> must not be mounted.

           <b>Note</b>
           <b>Prior to overwriting the primary superblock, please make sure</b>
           <b>that the backup copies are valid!</b>

       To dump a superblock use the <b>btrfs inspect-internal dump-super</b>
       command.

       Then run the check (in the non-repair mode) using the command
       <b>btrfs check -s </b>where <i>-s</i> specifies the superblock copy to use.

       Superblock copies exist in the following offsets on the device:

       •   primary: <i>64KiB</i> (65536)

       •   1st copy: <i>64MiB</i> (67108864)

       •   2nd copy: <i>256GiB</i> (274877906944)

       A superblock size is <i>4KiB</i> (4096).
