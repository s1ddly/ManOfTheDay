       NSA Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) is an implementation of a
       flexible mandatory access control architecture in the Linux
       operating system.  The SELinux architecture provides general
       support for the enforcement of many kinds of mandatory access
       control policies, including those based on the concepts of Type
       EnforcementÂ®, Role- Based Access Control, and Multi-Level
       Security.  Background information and technical documentation
       about SELinux can be found at <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pagestps://github.com/SELinuxProject">https://github.com/SELinuxProject</a>.

       The <i>/etc/selinux/config</i> configuration file controls whether
       SELinux is enabled or disabled, and if enabled, whether SELinux
       operates in permissive mode or enforcing mode.  The <b>SELINUX</b>
       variable may be set to any one of <i>disabled</i>, <i>permissive</i>, or
       <i>enforcing</i> to select one of these options.  The <i>disabled</i> disables
       most of the SELinux kernel and application code, leaving the
       system running without any SELinux protection.  The <i>permissive</i>
       option enables the SELinux code, but causes it to operate in a
       mode where accesses that would be denied by policy are permitted
       but audited.  The <i>enforcing</i> option enables the SELinux code and
       causes it to enforce access denials as well as auditing them.
       <i>permissive</i> mode may yield a different set of denials than
       enforcing mode, both because enforcing mode will prevent an
       operation from proceeding past the first denial and because some
       application code will fall back to a less privileged mode of
       operation if denied access.

       <b>NOTE: </b>Disabling SELinux by setting <b>SELINUX=disabled </b>in
       <i>/etc/selinux/config</i> is deprecated and depending on kernel version
       and configuration it might not lead to SELinux being completely
       disabled.  Specifically, the SELinux hooks will still be executed
       internally, but the SELinux policy will not be loaded and no
       operation will be denied.  In such state, the system will act as
       if SELinux was disabled, although some operations might behave
       slightly differently.  To properly disable SELinux, it is
       recommended to use the <b>selinux=0 </b>kernel boot option instead.  In
       that case SELinux will be disabled regardless of what is set in
       the <i>/etc/selinux/config</i> file.

       The <i>/etc/selinux/config</i> configuration file also controls what
       policy is active on the system.  SELinux allows for multiple
       policies to be installed on the system, but only one policy may
       be active at any given time.  At present, multiple kinds of
       SELinux policy exist: targeted, mls for example.  The targeted
       policy is designed as a policy where most user processes operate
       without restrictions, and only specific services are placed into
       distinct security domains that are confined by the policy.  For
       example, the user would run in a completely unconfined domain
       while the named daemon or apache daemon would run in a specific
       domain tailored to its operation.  The MLS (Multi-Level Security)
       policy is designed as a policy where all processes are
       partitioned into fine-grained security domains and confined by
       policy.  MLS also supports the Bell And LaPadula model, where
       processes are not only confined by the type but also the level of
       the data.

       You can define which policy you will run by setting the
       <b>SELINUXTYPE </b>environment variable within <i>/etc/selinux/config</i>.  You
       must reboot and possibly relabel if you change the policy type to
       have it take effect on the system.  The corresponding policy
       configuration for each such policy must be installed in the
       <i>/etc/selinux/{SELINUXTYPE}/</i> directories.

       A given SELinux policy can be customized further based on a set
       of compile-time tunable options and a set of runtime policy
       booleans.  <b>system-config-selinux </b>allows customization of these
       booleans and tunables.

       Many domains that are protected by SELinux also include SELinux
       man pages explaining how to customize their policy.
