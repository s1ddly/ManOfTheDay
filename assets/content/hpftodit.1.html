       <i>hpftodit</i> creates a font file for use with a Hewlett-Packard
       LaserJet 4-series (or newer) printer with the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/grolj4.1.html">grolj4(1)</a>, output
       driver of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/groff.1.html">groff(1)</a>, using data from an HP tagged font metric
       (TFM) file.  <i>tfm-file</i> is the name of the TFM file for the font;
       Intellifont and TrueType TFM files are supported, but symbol set
       TFM files are not.  <i>map-file</i> is a file giving the <i>groff</i> names for
       characters in the font; this file should consist of a sequence of
       lines of the form
              <i>m u c1 c2</i> ... [# <i>comment</i>]
       where <i>m</i> is a decimal integer giving the MSL (Master Symbol List)
       number of the character, <i>u</i> is a hexadecimal integer giving the
       Unicode value of the character, and <i>c1</i>, <i>c2</i>, ...  are the <i>groff</i>
       names of the character (see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/groff_char.7.html">groff_char(7)</a> for a list).  The
       values can be separated by any whitespace; the Unicode value must
       use uppercase digits A–F, and must be without a leading “<b>0x</b>”,
       “<b>u</b>”, or “<b>U+</b>”.  Unicode values corresponding to composite glyphs
       are decomposed; e.g., “<b>u00C0</b>” becomes “<b>u0041_0300</b>”.  The name for
       a glyph without a <i>groff</i> name may be given as <b>u</b><i>XXXX</i> if the glyph
       corresponds to a Unicode value, or as an unnamed glyph “<b>---</b>”.  If
       the given Unicode value is in the Private Use Area
       (0xE000–0xF8FF), the glyph is included as an unnamed glyph.
       Refer to <b>groff_diff</b>(1) for additional information about unnamed
       glyphs and how to access them.

       Blank lines and lines beginning with “<b>#</b>” are ignored.  A “<b>#</b>”
       following one or more <i>groff</i> names begins a comment.  Because “<b>#</b>”
       is a valid <i>groff</i> name, it must appear first in a list of <i>groff</i>
       names if a comment is included, e.g.,
              3   0023   #   # number sign
       or
              3   0023   # sh   # number sign
       rather than
              3   0023   sh #   # number sign
       which will treat the first “<b>#</b>” as the beginning of the comment.

       The <i>groff</i> font file is written to the specified <i>output-font</i>; if
       this operand is “<b>-</b>”, the font file is written to the standard
       output stream.

       The <b>-s </b>option should be given if the font is special (a font is
       “special” if <i>groff</i> should search it whenever a character is not
       found in the current font).  If the font is special, it should be
       listed in the <b>fonts </b>command in the <i>DESC</i> file; if it is not
       special, there is no need to list it, since <i>groff</i> can
       automatically mount it when it's first used.

       If the <b>-i </b>option is used, <i>hpftodit</i> automatically will generate an
       italic correction, a left italic correction and a subscript
       correction for each character (the significance of these
       parameters is explained in <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/groff_font.5.html">groff_font(5)</a>).
