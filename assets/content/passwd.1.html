       The <b>passwd </b>command changes passwords for user accounts. A normal
       user may only change the password for their own account, while
       the superuser may change the password for any account.  <b>passwd</b>
       also changes the account or associated password validity period.

   <b>Password Changes</b>
       The user is first prompted for their old password, if one is
       present. This password is then encrypted and compared against the
       stored password. The user has only one chance to enter the
       correct password. The superuser is permitted to bypass this step
       so that forgotten passwords may be changed.

       After the password has been entered, password aging information
       is checked to see if the user is permitted to change the password
       at this time. If not, <b>passwd </b>refuses to change the password and
       exits.

       The user is then prompted twice for a replacement password. The
       second entry is compared against the first and both are required
       to match in order for the password to be changed.

       Then, the password is tested for complexity. As a general
       guideline, passwords should consist of 6 to 8 characters
       including one or more characters from each of the following sets:

       •   lower case alphabetics

       •   digits 0 thru 9

       •   punctuation marks

       Care must be taken not to include the system default erase or
       kill characters.  <b>passwd </b>will reject any password which is not
       suitably complex.

   <b>Hints for user passwords</b>
       The security of a password depends upon the strength of the
       encryption algorithm and the size of the key space. The legacy
       <i>UNIX</i> System encryption method is based on the NBS DES algorithm.
       More recent methods are now recommended (see <b>ENCRYPT_METHOD</b>). The
       size of the key space depends upon the randomness of the password
       which is selected.

       Compromises in password security normally result from careless
       password selection or handling. For this reason, you should not
       select a password which appears in a dictionary or which must be
       written down. The password should also not be a proper name, your
       license number, birth date, or street address. Any of these may
       be used as guesses to violate system security.
