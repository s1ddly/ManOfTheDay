       The Universal/Ugly 32bit filter allows to match arbitrary
       bitfields in the packet. Due to breaking everything down to
       values, masks and offsets, It is equally powerful and hard to
       use. Luckily many abstracting directives are present which allow
       defining rules on a higher level and therefore free the user from
       having to fiddle with bits and masks in many cases.

       There are two general modes of invocation: The first mode creates
       a new filter to delegate packets to different destinations. Apart
       from the obvious ones, namely classifying the packet by
       specifying a <i>CLASSID</i> or calling an <b>action</b>, one may <b>link </b>one
       filter to another one (or even a list of them), effectively
       organizing filters into a tree-like hierarchy.

       Typically filter delegation is done by means of a hash table,
       which leads to the second mode of invocation: it merely serves to
       set up these hash tables. Filters can select a hash table and
       provide a key selector from which a hash is to be computed and
       used as key to lookup the table's bucket which contains filters
       for further processing. This is useful if a high number of
       filters is in use, as the overhead of performing the hash
       operation and table lookup becomes negligible in that case. Using
       hashtables with <b>u32 </b>basically involves the following pattern:

       (1) Creating a new hash table, specifying it's size using the
           <b>divisor </b>parameter and ideally a handle by which the table can
           be identified. If the latter is not given, the kernel chooses
           one on it's own, which has to be guessed later.

       (2) Creating filters which link to the created table in <i>(1)</i> using
           the <b>link </b>parameter and defining the packet data which the
           kernel will use to calculate the <b>hashkey</b>.

       (3) Adding filters to buckets in the hash table from <i>(1)</i>.  In
           order to avoid having to know how exactly the kernel creates
           the hash key, there is the <b>sample </b>parameter, which gives
           sample data to hash and thereby define the table bucket the
           filter should be added to.

       In fact, even if not explicitly requested <b>u32 </b>creates a hash
       table for every <b>priority </b>a filter is being added with. The
       table's size is 1 though, so it is in fact merely a linked list.
