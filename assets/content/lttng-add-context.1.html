       The <b>lttng add-context </b>command adds one or more context fields to
       a channel.

       Channels are created with the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/lttng-enable-channel.1.html">lttng-enable-channel(1)</a> command.

       When context fields are added to a channel, all the events
       emitted within this channel contain the dynamic values of those
       context fields.

       If the <b>--session </b>option is omitted, the current tracing session
       is used. If the <b>--channel </b>option is omitted, the context fields
       are added to all the selected tracing session’s channels.

       Many context fields can be added to a channel at once by
       repeating the <b>--type </b>option.

       perf counters are available as per-CPU (<b>perf:cpu: </b>prefix) as well
       as per-thread (<b>perf:thread: </b>prefix) counters. Currently, per-CPU
       counters can only be used in the Linux kernel tracing domain,
       while per-thread counters can only be used in the user space
       tracing domain.

       It is also possible to enable PMU counters by raw ID using the
       <b>perf:cpu:raw:rN:NAME </b>(Linux kernel tracing domain) or
       <b>perf:thread:raw:rN:NAME </b>(user space tracing domain), with:

       <b>N</b>
           A hexadecimal event descriptor which is the same format as
           used by <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/perf-record.1.html">perf-record(1)</a>: a concatenation of the event number
           and umask value provided by the processor’s manufacturer. The
           possible values for this field are processor-specific.

       <b>NAME</b>
           Custom name to easily recognize the counter.

       Application-specific context fields can be added to a channel
       using the following syntax:

           $app.<i>PROVIDER</i>:<i>TYPE</i>

       with:

       <i>PROVIDER</i>
           Provider name.

       <i>TYPE</i>
           Context type name.

           <b>Note</b>
           Make sure to <b>single-quote </b>the type when running the command
           from a shell, as <b>$ </b>is a special character for variable
           substitution in most shells.

       Use the <b>--list </b>option without other arguments to list the
       available context field names.

       See the <i>LIMITATIONS</i> section below for a list of limitations to
       consider.
