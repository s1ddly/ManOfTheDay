       systemd-cryptsetup@.service is a service responsible for setting
       up encrypted block devices. It is instantiated for each device
       that requires decryption for access.

       systemd-cryptsetup@.service instances are part of the
       system-systemd\x2dcryptsetup.slice slice, which is destroyed only
       very late in the shutdown procedure. This allows the encrypted
       devices to remain up until filesystems have been unmounted.

       systemd-cryptsetup@.service will ask for hard disk passwords via
       the <b>password agent logic</b><b></b>[1], in order to query the user for the
       password using the right mechanism at boot and during runtime.

       At early boot and when the system manager configuration is
       reloaded, /etc/crypttab is translated into
       systemd-cryptsetup@.service units by
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/systemd-cryptsetup-generator.8.html">systemd-cryptsetup-generator(8)</a>.

       In order to unlock a volume a password or binary key is required.
       systemd-cryptsetup@.service tries to acquire a suitable password
       or binary key via the following mechanisms, tried in order:

        1. If a key file is explicitly configured (via the third column
           in /etc/crypttab), a key read from it is used. If a PKCS#11
           token, FIDO2 token or TPM2 device is configured (using the
           <i>pkcs11-uri=</i>, <i>fido2-device=</i>, <i>tpm2-device=</i> options) the key is
           decrypted before use.

        2. If no key file is configured explicitly this way, a key file
           is automatically loaded from
           /etc/cryptsetup-keys.d/<i>volume</i>.key and
           /run/cryptsetup-keys.d/<i>volume</i>.key, if present. Here too, if a
           PKCS#11/FIDO2/TPM2 token/device is configured, any key found
           this way is decrypted before use.

        3. If the <i>try-empty-password</i> option is specified it is then
           attempted to unlock the volume with an empty password.

        4. The kernel keyring is then checked for a suitable cached
           password from previous attempts.

        5. Finally, the user is queried for a password, possibly
           multiple times, unless the <i>headless</i> option is set.

       If no suitable key may be acquired via any of the mechanisms
       describes above, volume activation fails.
