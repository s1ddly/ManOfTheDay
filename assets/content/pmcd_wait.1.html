<pre>
       <b>pmcd_wait </b>waits for the Performance Metrics Collector Daemon
       (PMCD) to be running and accepting client connections.

       Unless directed to another host by the <b>-h </b>option, <b>pmcd_wait </b>will
       try to contact <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> on the local host.

       <b>pmcd_wait </b>will timeout and abandon the attempt to connect to <b>pmcd</b>
       after 60 seconds.  This default timeout interval may be changed
       using the <b>-t </b>option, where the <i>interval</i> argument follows the
       syntax described in <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/PCPIntro.1.html">PCPIntro(1)</a> and in the simplest form may be
       an unsigned integer (the implied units in this case are seconds).

       On successful connection to <b>pmcd </b>an exit status of zero is
       returned.

       If an error or timeout occurs, then a non-zero exit status is
       returned as described below.
