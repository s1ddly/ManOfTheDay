       Adds a <i>replace</i> reference in <b>refs/replace/ </b>namespace.

       The name of the <i>replace</i> reference is the SHA-1 of the object that
       is replaced. The content of the <i>replace</i> reference is the SHA-1 of
       the replacement object.

       The replaced object and the replacement object must be of the
       same type. This restriction can be bypassed using <b>-f</b>.

       Unless <b>-f </b>is given, the <i>replace</i> reference must not yet exist.

       There is no other restriction on the replaced and replacement
       objects. Merge commits can be replaced by non-merge commits and
       vice versa.

       Replacement references will be used by default by all Git
       commands except those doing reachability traversal (prune, pack
       transfer and fsck).

       It is possible to disable use of replacement references for any
       command using the <b>--no-replace-objects </b>option just after <i>git</i>.

       For example if commit <i>foo</i> has been replaced by commit <i>bar</i>:

           $ git --no-replace-objects cat-file commit foo

       shows information about commit <i>foo</i>, while:

           $ git cat-file commit foo

       shows information about commit <i>bar</i>.

       The <b>GIT_NO_REPLACE_OBJECTS </b>environment variable can be set to
       achieve the same effect as the <b>--no-replace-objects </b>option.
