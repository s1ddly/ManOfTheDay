       vgcreate creates a new VG on block devices. If the devices were
       not previously initialized as PVs with <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/pvcreate.8.html">pvcreate(8)</a>, vgcreate will
       inititialize them, making them PVs. The pvcreate options for
       initializing devices are also available with vgcreate.

       When vgcreate uses an existing PV, that PV's existing values for
       metadata size, PE start, etc, are used, even if different values
       are specified in the vgcreate command.  To change these values,
       first use pvremove on the device.
