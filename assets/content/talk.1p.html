       The <i>talk</i> utility is a two-way, screen-oriented communication
       program.

       When first invoked, <i>talk</i> shall send a message similar to:

           Message from &lt;<i>unspecified string</i>&gt;
           talk: connection requested by <i>your_address</i>
           talk: respond with: talk <i>your_address</i>

       to the specified <i>address</i>.  At this point, the recipient of the
       message can reply by typing:

           talk <i>your_address</i>

       Once communication is established, the two parties can type
       simultaneously, with their output displayed in separate regions
       of the screen. Characters shall be processed as follows:

        *  Typing the &lt;alert&gt; character shall alert the recipient's
           terminal.

        *  Typing &lt;control&gt;‐L shall cause the sender's screen regions to
           be refreshed.

        *  Typing the erase and kill characters shall affect the
           sender's terminal in the manner described by the <b>termios</b>
           interface in the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017,
           <i>Chapter 11</i>, <i>General Terminal Interface</i>.

        *  Typing the interrupt or end-of-file characters shall
           terminate the local <i>talk</i> utility. Once the <i>talk</i> session has
           been terminated on one side, the other side of the <i>talk</i>
           session shall be notified that the <i>talk</i> session has been
           terminated and shall be able to do nothing except exit.

        *  Typing characters from <i>LC_CTYPE</i> classifications <b>print </b>or
           <b>space </b>shall cause those characters to be sent to the
           recipient's terminal.

        *  When and only when the <i>stty</i> <b>iexten </b>local mode is enabled, the
           existence and processing of additional special control
           characters and multi-byte or single-byte functions shall be
           implementation-defined.

        *  Typing other non-printable characters shall cause
           implementation-defined sequences of printable characters to
           be sent to the recipient's terminal.

       Permission to be a recipient of a <i>talk</i> message can be denied or
       granted by use of the <i>mesg</i> utility. However, a user's privilege
       may further constrain the domain of accessibility of other users'
       terminals. The <i>talk</i> utility shall fail when the user lacks
       appropriate privileges to perform the requested action.

       Certain block-mode terminals do not have all the capabilities
       necessary to support the simultaneous exchange of messages
       required for <i>talk</i>.  When this type of exchange cannot be
       supported on such terminals, the implementation may support an
       exchange with reduced levels of simultaneous interaction or it
       may report an error describing the terminal-related deficiency.
