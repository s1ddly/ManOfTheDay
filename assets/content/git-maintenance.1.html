       Run tasks to optimize Git repository data, speeding up other Git
       commands and reducing storage requirements for the repository.

       Git commands that add repository data, such as <b>git add </b>or <b>git</b>
       <b>fetch</b>, are optimized for a responsive user experience. These
       commands do not take time to optimize the Git data, since such
       optimizations scale with the full size of the repository while
       these user commands each perform a relatively small action.

       The <b>git maintenance </b>command provides flexibility for how to
       optimize the Git repository.
