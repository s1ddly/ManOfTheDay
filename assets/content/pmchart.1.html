       <b>pmchart </b>is a graphical utility that plots performance metrics
       values available through the facilities of the Performance Co-
       Pilot (PCP).  Multiple charts can be displayed simultaneously,
       either aligned on the unified time axis (X-axis), and through the
       use of multiple interface Tabs.

       Metric values can be sourced from one or more live hosts
       (simultaneously).  Alternatively, one or more sets of PCP
       archives can be used as a source of historical data.  See
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/PCPIntro.1.html">PCPIntro(1)</a> for an in-depth discussion of the capabilities of the
       PCP framework, many of which are used by <b>pmchart.</b>

       Many aspects of the behaviour of <b>pmchart </b>can be customised
       through the interface.  In particular, the use of "views" (refer
       to the section describing VIEWS later in this document) allows
       predefined sets of metrics and charting parameters like colors,
       scaling, titles, legends, and so on to be stored for later use,
       or use with different hosts and sets of archives.  In addition,
       the Preferences dialog allows customisations to the rest of the
       <b>pmchart </b>user interface to be saved and restored between different
       invocations of the tool.  This allows the default background
       color, highlight color, contents and location of the toolbar, and
       many other aspects to be configured.

       <b>pmchart </b>makes extensive use of the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmtime.1.html">pmtime(1)</a> utility for time
       control, refer to the <b>pmtime </b>manual page for further details of
       its operation.
