<pre>
       This PMDA extracts performance data from sending the INFO command
       to a Redis (redis.io) server, which includes:

       • General information about the Redis server

       • Client connections

       • Memory consumption

       • Persistence statistics

       • Replication statistics

       • CPU consumption statistics

       • Redis command statistics

       • Redis Cluster statistics

       • Database related statistics

       The hostname (localhost), port (6379 by default) and other
       configuration information must be specified in the
       $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/redis/redis.conf file.

           <b># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/redis</b>
           <b># [ edit redis.conf ]</b>
             <b>host=localhost.localdomain:6379</b>

       To uninstall, the following must be done as root:

           <b># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/redis</b>
           <b># ./Remove</b>

       Once this is setup, you can access the names and values for the
       redis performance metrics by doing the following as root:

           <b># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/redis</b>
           <b># ./Install</b>

       To uninstall, the following must be done as root:

           <b># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/redis</b>
           <b># ./Remove</b>

       <b>pmdaredis </b>is launched by <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> and should never be executed
       directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> when the
       agent is installed or removed.
