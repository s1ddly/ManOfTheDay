       <b>mandb </b>is used to initialise or manually update <b>index </b>database
       caches.  The caches contain information relevant to the current
       state of the manual page system and the information stored within
       them is used by the man-db utilities to enhance their speed and
       functionality.

       When creating or updating an <b>index</b>, <b>mandb </b>will warn of bad ROFF
       .so requests, bogus manual page filenames and manual pages from
       which the <b>whatis </b>cannot be parsed.

       Supplying <b>mandb </b>with an optional colon-delimited path will
       override the internal system manual page hierarchy search path,
       determined from information found within the man-db configuration
       file.
