       <b>dh_installxfonts </b>is a debhelper program that is responsible for
       registering X fonts, so their corresponding <i>fonts.dir</i>,
       <i>fonts.alias</i>, and <i>fonts.scale</i> be rebuilt properly at install time.

       Before calling this program, you should have installed any X
       fonts provided by your package into the appropriate location in
       the package build directory, and if you have <i>fonts.alias</i> or
       <i>fonts.scale</i> files, you should install them into the correct
       location under <i>etc/X11/fonts</i> in your package build directory.

       Your package should depend on <b>xfonts-utils </b>so that the
       <b>update-fonts-</b><i>*</i> commands are available. (This program adds that
       dependency to <b>${misc:Depends}</b>.)

       This program automatically generates the <i>postinst</i> and <i>postrm</i>
       commands needed to register X fonts. These commands are inserted
       into the maintainer scripts by <b>dh_installdeb</b>. See
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dh_installdeb.1.html">dh_installdeb(1)</a> for an explanation of how this works.
