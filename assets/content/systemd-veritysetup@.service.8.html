       systemd-veritysetup@.service is a service responsible for setting
       up integrity protection (verity) block devices. It should be
       instantiated for each device that requires integrity protection.

       reloaded kernel command line configuration for integrity
       protected block devices is translated into
       systemd-veritysetup@.service units by
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/systemd-veritysetup-generator.8.html">systemd-veritysetup-generator(8)</a>.

       systemd-veritysetup@.service calls <b>systemd-veritysetup</b>.
