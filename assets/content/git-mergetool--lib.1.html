       This is not a command the end user would want to run. Ever. This
       documentation is meant for people who are studying the
       Porcelain-ish scripts and/or are writing new ones.

       The <i>git-mergetool--lib</i> scriptlet is designed to be sourced (using
       <b>.</b>) by other shell scripts to set up functions for working with
       Git merge tools.

       Before sourcing <i>git-mergetool--lib</i>, your script must set
       <b>TOOL_MODE </b>to define the operation mode for the functions listed
       below. <i>diff</i> and <i>merge</i> are valid values.
