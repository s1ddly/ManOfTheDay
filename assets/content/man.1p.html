<pre>
       The <i>man</i> utility shall write information about each of the <i>name</i>
       operands. If <i>name</i> is the name of a standard utility, <i>man</i> at a
       minimum shall write a message describing the syntax used by the
       standard utility, its options, and operands. If more information
       is available, the <i>man</i> utility shall provide it in an
       implementation-defined manner.

       An implementation may provide information for values of <i>name</i>
       other than the standard utilities. Standard utilities that are
       listed as optional and that are not supported by the
       implementation either shall cause a brief message indicating that
       fact to be displayed or shall cause a full display of information
       as described previously.
