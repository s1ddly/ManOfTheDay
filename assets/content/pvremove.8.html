       pvremove wipes the label on a device so that LVM will no longer
       recognise it as a PV.

       A PV cannot be removed from a VG while it is used by an active
       LV.

       Repeat the force option (<b>-ff</b>) to forcibly remove a PV belonging
       to an existing VG. Normally, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/vgreduce.8.html">vgreduce(8)</a> should be used instead.
