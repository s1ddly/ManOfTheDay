       <b>memusagestat </b>creates a PNG file containing a graphical
       representation of the memory profiling data in the file <i>datafile</i>;
       that file is generated via the <i>-d</i> (or <i>--data</i>) option of
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/memusage.1.html">memusage(1)</a>.

       The red line in the graph shows the heap usage (allocated memory)
       and the green line shows the stack usage.  The x-scale is either
       the number of memory-handling function calls or (if the <i>-t</i> option
       is specified) time.
