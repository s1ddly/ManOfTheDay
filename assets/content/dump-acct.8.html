       The dump-acct command transforms the output <b>file </b>from the accton
       format to the human-readable format: one record per line.  Each
       record consists of severald fields which are separated by
       character "|" (the meaning of concreate field depends on the
       version of kernel package - with which the accton file was
       created).
