       Generate core dumps of one or more running programs with process
       IDs <i>pid1</i>, <i>pid2</i>, etc.  A core file produced by <b>gcore </b>is equivalent
       to one produced by the kernel when the process crashes (and when
       "ulimit -c" was used to set up an appropriate core dump limit).
       However, unlike after a crash, after <b>gcore </b>finishes its job the
       program remains running without any change.
