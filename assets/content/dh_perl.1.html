       <b>dh_perl </b>is a debhelper program that is responsible for generating
       the <b>${perl:Depends} </b>substitutions and adding them to substvars
       files.

       The program will look at Perl scripts and modules in your
       package, and will use this information to generate a dependency
       on <b>perl </b>or <b>perlapi</b>. The dependency will be substituted into your
       package's <i>control</i> file wherever you place the token
       <b>${perl:Depends}</b>.

       <b>dh_perl </b>also cleans up empty directories that MakeMaker can
       generate when installing Perl modules.
