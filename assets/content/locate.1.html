       This manual page documents the GNU version of <b>locate</b>.  For each
       given pattern, <b>locate </b>searches one or more databases of file
       names and displays the file names that contain the pattern.
       Patterns can contain shell-style metacharacters: `*', `?', and
       `[]'.  The metacharacters do not treat `/' or `.'  specially.
       Therefore, a pattern `foo*bar' can match a file name that
       contains `foo3/bar', and a pattern `*duck*' can match a file name
       that contains `lake/.ducky'.  Patterns that contain
       metacharacters should be quoted to protect them from expansion by
       the shell.

       If a pattern is a plain string — it contains no metacharacters —
       <b>locate </b>displays all file names in the database that contain that
       string anywhere.  If a pattern does contain metacharacters,
       <b>locate </b>only displays file names that match the pattern exactly.
       As a result, patterns that contain metacharacters should usually
       begin with a `*', and will most often end with one as well.  The
       exceptions are patterns that are intended to explicitly match the
       beginning or end of a file name.

       The file name databases contain lists of files that were on the
       system when the databases were last updated.  The system
       administrator can choose the file name of the default database,
       the frequency with which the databases are updated, and the
       directories for which they contain entries; see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/updatedb.1.html">updatedb(1)</a>.

       If <b>locate</b>'s output is going to a terminal, unusual characters in
       the output are escaped in the same way as for the -print action
       of the <b>find </b>command.  If the output is not going to a terminal,
       file names are printed exactly as-is.
