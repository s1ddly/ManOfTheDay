       The variable <i>environ</i> points to an array of pointers to strings
       called the "environment".  The last pointer in this array has the
       value NULL.  This array of strings is made available to the
       process by the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/execve.2.html">execve(2)</a> call when a new program is started.
       When a child process is created via <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fork.2.html">fork(2)</a>, it inherits a <i>copy</i>
       of its parent's environment.

       By convention, the strings in <i>environ</i> have the form "<i>name</i><b>=</b><i>value</i>".
       The name is case-sensitive and may not contain the character "<b>=</b>".
       The value can be anything that can be represented as a string.
       The name and the value may not contain an embedded null byte
       ('\0'), since this is assumed to terminate the string.

       Environment variables may be placed in the shell's environment by
       the <i>export</i> command in <b>sh</b>(1), or by the <i>setenv</i> command if you use
       <b>csh</b>(1).

       The initial environment of the shell is populated in various
       ways, such as definitions from <i>/etc/environment</i> that are
       processed by <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/pam_env.8.html">pam_env(8)</a> for all users at login time (on systems
       that employ <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/pam.8.html">pam(8)</a>).  In addition, various shell initialization
       scripts, such as the system-wide <i>/etc/profile</i> script and per-user
       initializations script may include commands that add variables to
       the shell's environment; see the manual page of your preferred
       shell for details.

       Bourne-style shells support the syntax

           NAME=value command

       to create an environment variable definition only in the scope of
       the process that executes <i>command</i>.  Multiple variable
       definitions, separated by white space, may precede <i>command</i>.

       Arguments may also be placed in the environment at the point of
       an <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/exec.3.html">exec(3)</a>.  A C program can manipulate its environment using the
       functions <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/getenv.3.html">getenv(3)</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/putenv.3.html">putenv(3)</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/setenv.3.html">setenv(3)</a>, and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/unsetenv.3.html">unsetenv(3)</a>.

       What follows is a list of environment variables typically seen on
       a system.  This list is incomplete and includes only common
       variables seen by average users in their day-to-day routine.
       Environment variables specific to a particular program or library
       function are documented in the ENVIRONMENT section of the
       appropriate manual page.

       <b>USER   </b>The name of the logged-in user (used by some BSD-derived
              programs).  Set at login time, see section NOTES below.

       <b>LOGNAME</b>
              The name of the logged-in user (used by some System-V
              derived programs).  Set at login time, see section NOTES
              below.

       <b>HOME   </b>A user's login directory.  Set at login time, see section
              NOTES below.

       <b>LANG   </b>The name of a locale to use for locale categories when not
              overridden by <b>LC_ALL </b>or more specific environment
              variables such as <b>LC_COLLATE</b>, <b>LC_CTYPE</b>, <b>LC_MESSAGES</b>,
              <b>LC_MONETARY</b>, <b>LC_NUMERIC</b>, and <b>LC_TIME </b>(see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/locale.7.html">locale(7)</a> for
              further details of the <b>LC_* </b>environment variables).

       <b>PATH   </b>The sequence of directory prefixes that <b>sh</b>(1) and many
              other programs employ when searching for an executable
              file that is specified as a simple filename (i.a., a
              pathname that contains no slashes).  The prefixes are
              separated by colons (<b>:</b>).  The list of prefixes is searched
              from beginning to end, by checking the pathname formed by
              concatenating a prefix, a slash, and the filename, until a
              file with execute permission is found.

              As a legacy feature, a zero-length prefix (specified as
              two adjacent colons, or an initial or terminating colon)
              is interpreted to mean the current working directory.
              However, use of this feature is deprecated, and POSIX
              notes that a conforming application shall use an explicit
              pathname (e.g., <i>.</i>)  to specify the current working
              directory.

              Analogously to <b>PATH</b>, one has <b>CDPATH </b>used by some shells to
              find the target of a change directory command, <b>MANPATH</b>
              used by <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/man.1.html">man(1)</a> to find manual pages, and so on.

       <b>PWD    </b>The current working directory.  Set by some shells.

       <b>SHELL  </b>The absolute pathname of the user's login shell.  Set at
              login time, see section NOTES below.

       <b>TERM   </b>The terminal type for which output is to be prepared.

       <b>PAGER  </b>The user's preferred utility to display text files.  Any
              string acceptable as a command-string operand to the <i>sh -c</i>
              command shall be valid.  If <b>PAGER </b>is null or is not set,
              then applications that launch a pager will default to a
              program such as <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/less.1.html">less(1)</a> or <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/more.1.html">more(1)</a>.

       <b>EDITOR</b>/<b>VISUAL</b>
              The user's preferred utility to edit text files.  Any
              string acceptable as a command_string operand to the <i>sh -c</i>
              command shall be valid.

       Note that the behavior of many programs and library routines is
       influenced by the presence or value of certain environment
       variables.  Examples include the following:

       *  The variables <b>LANG</b>, <b>LANGUAGE</b>, <b>NLSPATH</b>, <b>LOCPATH</b>, <b>LC_ALL</b>,
          <b>LC_MESSAGES</b>, and so on influence locale handling; see
          <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/catopen.3.html">catopen(3)</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/gettext.3.html">gettext(3)</a>, and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/locale.7.html">locale(7)</a>.

       *  <b>TMPDIR </b>influences the path prefix of names created by
          <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/tempnam.3.html">tempnam(3)</a> and other routines, and the temporary directory
          used by <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/sort.1.html">sort(1)</a> and other programs.

       *  <b>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</b>, <b>LD_PRELOAD</b>, and other <b>LD_* </b>variables
          influence the behavior of the dynamic loader/linker.  See also
          <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ld.so.8.html">ld.so(8)</a>.

       *  <b>POSIXLY_CORRECT </b>makes certain programs and library routines
          follow the prescriptions of POSIX.

       *  The behavior of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/malloc.3.html">malloc(3)</a> is influenced by <b>MALLOC_* </b>variables.

       *  The variable <b>HOSTALIASES </b>gives the name of a file containing
          aliases to be used with <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/gethostbyname.3.html">gethostbyname(3)</a>.

       *  <b>TZ </b>and <b>TZDIR </b>give timezone information used by <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/tzset.3.html">tzset(3)</a> and
          through that by functions like <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/ctime.3.html">ctime(3)</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/localtime.3.html">localtime(3)</a>,
          <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/mktime.3.html">mktime(3)</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/strftime.3.html">strftime(3)</a>.  See also <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/tzselect.8.html">tzselect(8)</a>.

       *  <b>TERMCAP </b>gives information on how to address a given terminal
          (or gives the name of a file containing such information).

       *  <b>COLUMNS </b>and <b>LINES </b>tell applications about the window size,
          possibly overriding the actual size.

       *  <b>PRINTER </b>or <b>LPDEST </b>may specify the desired printer to use.  See
          <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/lpr.1.html">lpr(1)</a>.
