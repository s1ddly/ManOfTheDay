       Read the <b>.idx </b>file for a Git packfile (created with
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/git-pack-objects.1.html">git-pack-objects(1)</a> or <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/git-index-pack.1.html">git-index-pack(1)</a>) from the standard
       input, and dump its contents. The output consists of one object
       per line, with each line containing two or three space-separated
       columns:

       •   the first column is the offset in bytes of the object within
           the corresponding packfile

       •   the second column is the object id of the object

       •   if the index version is 2 or higher, the third column
           contains the CRC32 of the object data

       The objects are output in the order in which they are found in
       the index file, which should be (in a correctly constructed file)
       sorted by object id.

       Note that you can get more information on a packfile by calling
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/git-verify-pack.1.html">git-verify-pack(1)</a>. However, as this command considers only the
       index file itself, it’s both faster and more flexible.
