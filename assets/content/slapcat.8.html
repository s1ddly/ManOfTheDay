       <b>Slapcat </b>is used to generate an LDAP Directory Interchange Format
       (LDIF) output based upon the contents of a <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/slapd.8.html">slapd(8)</a> database.  It
       opens the given database determined by the database number or
       suffix and writes the corresponding LDIF to standard output or
       the specified file.  Databases configured as <b>subordinate </b>of this
       one are also output, unless <b>-g </b>is specified.

       The entry records are presented in database order, not superior
       first order.  The entry records will include all (user and
       operational) attributes stored in the database.  The entry
       records will not include dynamically generated attributes (such
       as subschemaSubentry).

       The output of slapcat is intended to be used as input to
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/slapadd.8.html">slapadd(8)</a>.  The output of slapcat cannot generally be used as
       input to <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ldapadd.1.html">ldapadd(1)</a> or other LDAP clients without first editing
       the output.  This editing would normally include reordering the
       records into superior first order and removing no-user-
       modification operational attributes.
