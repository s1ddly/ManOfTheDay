       The <i>pathchk</i> utility shall check that one or more pathnames are
       valid (that is, they could be used to access or create a file
       without causing syntax errors) and portable (that is, no filename
       truncation results). More extensive portability checks are
       provided by the <b>-p </b>and <b>-P </b>options.

       By default, the <i>pathchk</i> utility shall check each component of
       each <i>pathname</i> operand based on the underlying file system. A
       diagnostic shall be written for each <i>pathname</i> operand that:

        *  Is longer than {PATH_MAX} bytes (see <b>Pathname Variable Values</b>
           in the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‚Äê2017, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man0/limits.h.0p.html">limits.h(0p)</a>)

        *  Contains any component longer than {NAME_MAX} bytes in its
           containing directory

        *  Contains any component in a directory that is not searchable

        *  Contains any byte sequence that is not valid in its
           containing directory

       The format of the diagnostic message is not specified, but shall
       indicate the error detected and the corresponding <i>pathname</i>
       operand.

       It shall not be considered an error if one or more components of
       a <i>pathname</i> operand do not exist as long as a file matching the
       pathname specified by the missing components could be created
       that does not violate any of the checks specified above.
