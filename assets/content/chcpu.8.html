       <b>chcpu </b>can modify the state of CPUs. It can enable or disable
       CPUs, scan for new CPUs, change the CPU dispatching <i>mode</i> of the
       underlying hypervisor, and request CPUs from the hypervisor
       (configure) or return CPUs to the hypervisor (deconfigure).

       Some options have a <i>cpu-list</i> argument. Use this argument to
       specify a comma-separated list of CPUs. The list can contain
       individual CPU addresses or ranges of addresses. For example,
       <b>0,5,7,9-11 </b>makes the command applicable to the CPUs with the
       addresses 0, 5, 7, 9, 10, and 11.
