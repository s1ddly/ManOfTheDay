       <b>dh_installman </b>is a debhelper program that handles installing man
       pages into the correct locations in package build directories.

       In compat 10 and earlier, this program was primarily for when
       upstream's build system does not properly install them as a part
       of its install step (or it does not have an install step).  In
       compat 11 and later, it also supports the default searchdir plus
       --sourcedir like <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dh_install.1.html">dh_install(1)</a> and has the advantage that it
       respects the nodoc build profile (unlike <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dh_install.1.html">dh_install(1)</a>).

       Even if you prefer to use <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dh_install.1.html">dh_install(1)</a> for installing the
       manpages, <b>dh_installman </b>can still be useful for converting the
       manpage encoding to UTF-8 and for converting <i>.so</i> links (as
       described below).  However, that part happens automatically
       without any explicit configuration.

       You tell <b>dh_installman </b>what man pages go in your packages, and it
       figures out where to install them based on the section field in
       their <b>.TH </b>or <b>.Dt </b>line. If you have a properly formatted <b>.TH </b>or
       <b>.Dt </b>line, your man page will be installed into the right
       directory, with the right name (this includes proper handling of
       pages with a subsection, like <b>3perl</b>, which are placed in <i>man3</i>,
       and given an extension of <i>.3perl</i>). If your <b>.TH </b>or <b>.Dt </b>line is
       incorrect or missing, the program may guess wrong based on the
       file extension.

       It also supports translated man pages, by looking for extensions
       like <i>.ll.8</i> and <i>.ll_LL.8</i>, or by use of the <b>--language </b>switch.

       If <b>dh_installman </b>seems to install a man page into the wrong
       section or with the wrong extension, this is because the man page
       has the wrong section listed in its <b>.TH </b>or <b>.Dt </b>line. Edit the man
       page and correct the section, and <b>dh_installman </b>will follow suit.
       See <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/man.7.html">man(7)</a> for details about the <b>.TH </b>section, and <b>mdoc</b>(7) for the
       <b>.Dt </b>section. If <b>dh_installman </b>seems to install a man page into a
       directory like <i>/usr/share/man/pl/man1/</i>, that is because your
       program has a name like <i>foo.pl</i>, and <b>dh_installman </b>assumes that
       means it is translated into Polish. Use <b>--language=C </b>to avoid
       this.

       After the man page installation step, <b>dh_installman </b>will check to
       see if any of the man pages in the temporary directories of any
       of the packages it is acting on contain <i>.so</i> links. If so, it
       changes them to symlinks.

       Also, <b>dh_installman </b>will use man to guess the character encoding
       of each manual page and convert it to UTF-8. If the guesswork
       fails for some reason, you can override it using an encoding
       declaration. See <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/manconv.1.html">manconv(1)</a> for details.

       From debhelper compatibility level 11 on, <b>dh_install </b>will fall
       back to looking in <i>debian/tmp</i> for files, if it does not find them
       in the current directory (or wherever you've told it to look
       using <b>--sourcedir</b>).
