       This looks up the &lt;file&gt;(s) in the index and, if there are any
       merge entries, passes the SHA-1 hash for those files as arguments
       1, 2, 3 (empty argument if no file), and &lt;file&gt; as argument 4.
       File modes for the three files are passed as arguments 5, 6 and
       7.
