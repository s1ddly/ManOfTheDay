       <b>pmclient </b>and <b>pmclient_fg </b>are simple clients that use the
       Performance Metrics Application Programming Interface (PMAPI) to
       report some high-level system performance metrics.

       The real value of these tools is as sample clients using the
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/PMAPI.3.html">PMAPI(3)</a>, interfaces and to this end the source code is included
       with the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) package (see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/PCPIntro.1.html">PCPIntro(1)</a>),
       and is typically installed in <i>/usr/share/pcp/demos/pmclient</i>.

       The <b>pmclient_fg </b>program differs to <b>pmclient </b>in that it uses the
       fetchgroup API extension to the PMAPI, see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/pmFetchGroup.3.html">pmFetchGroup(3)</a>.

       Normally <b>pmclient </b>operates on the distributed Performance Metrics
       Name Space (PMNS), however if the <b>-n </b>option is specified an
       alternative local PMNS is loaded from the file <i>pmnsfile</i>.

       Unless directed to another host by the <b>-h </b>option, or to an
       archive by the <b>-a </b>option, <b>pmclient </b>will contact the Performance
       Metrics Collector Daemon (PMCD) on the local host to obtain the
       required information.  The argument to <b>-a </b>is a comma-separated
       list of names, each of which may be the base name of an archive
       or the name of a directory containing one or more archives.  The
       <b>-a </b>and <b>-h </b>options are mutually exclusive.

       By default, <b>pmclient </b>reports the time of day according to the
       local timezone on the system where <b>pmclient </b>is run.  The <b>-Z</b>
       option changes the timezone to <i>timezone</i> in the format of the
       environment variable <b>TZ </b>as described in <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/environ.7.html">environ(7)</a>.  The <b>-z</b>
       option changes the timezone to the local timezone at the host
       that is the source of the performance metrics, as identified via
       either the <b>-h </b>or <b>-a </b>options.

       The output from <b>pmclient </b>is directed to standard output, and
       lists

       +  Aggregate CPU utilization, in the range 0 to 1.

       +  If the system has more than 1 CPU, the ordinal number of the
          busiest CPU, in the range 0 to ...

       +  If the system has more than 1 CPU, the CPU utilization for the
          busiest CPU.

       +  Real free memory in Mbytes.

       +  Aggregate physical disk I/O operations per second (IOPS).

       +  Load average over the last 1 minute and over the last 15
          minutes.
