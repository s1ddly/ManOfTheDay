       The <b>e2image </b>program will save critical ext2, ext3, or ext4 file
       system metadata located on <i>device</i> to a file specified by <i>image-</i>
       <i>file</i>.  The image file may be examined by <b>dumpe2fs </b>and <b>debugfs</b>, by
       using the <b>-i </b>option to those programs.  This can assist an expert
       in recovering catastrophically corrupted file systems.

       It is a very good idea to create image files for all file systems
       on a system and save the partition layout (which can be generated
       using the <b>fdisk -l </b>command) at regular intervals --- at boot
       time, and/or every week or so.  The image file should be stored
       on some file system other than the file system whose data it
       contains, to ensure that this data is accessible in the case
       where the file system has been badly damaged.

       To save disk space, <b>e2image </b>creates the image file as a sparse
       file, or in QCOW2 format.  Hence, if the sparse image file needs
       to be copied to another location, it should either be compressed
       first or copied using the <b>--sparse=always </b>option to the GNU
       version of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/cp.1.html">cp(1)</a>.  This does not apply to the QCOW2 image, which
       is not sparse.

       The size of an ext2 image file depends primarily on the size of
       the file systems and how many inodes are in use.  For a typical
       10 Gigabyte file system, with 200,000 inodes in use out of 1.2
       million inodes, the image file will be approximately 35
       Megabytes; a 4 Gigabyte file system with 15,000 inodes in use out
       of 550,000 inodes will result in a 3 Megabyte image file.  Image
       files tend to be quite compressible; an image file taking up 32
       Megabytes of space on disk will generally compress down to 3 or 4
       Megabytes.

       If <i>image-file</i> is <b>-</b>, then the output of <b>e2image </b>will be sent to
       standard output, so that the output can be piped to another
       program, such as <b>gzip</b>(1).  (Note that this is currently only
       supported when creating a raw image file using the <b>-r </b>option,
       since the process of creating a normal image file, or QCOW2 image
       currently requires random access to the file, which cannot be
       done using a pipe.
