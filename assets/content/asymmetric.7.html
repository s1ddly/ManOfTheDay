       The asymmetric-type key can be viewed as a container that
       comprises of a number of components:

       Parsers
              The asymmetric key parsers attempt to identify the content
              of the payload blob and extract useful data from it with
              which to instantiate the key.  The parser is only used
              when adding, instantiating or updating a key and isn't
              thereafter associated with the key.

              Available parsers include ones that can deal with DER-
              encoded <b>X.509</b>, DER-encoded <b>PKCS#8 </b>and DER-encoded <b>TPM</b>-
              wrapped blobs.

       Public and private keys
              These are the cryptographic components of the key pair.
              The public half should always be available, but the
              private half might not be.  What operations are available
              can be queried, as can the size of the key.  The key
              material may or may not actually reside in the kernel.

       Identifiers
              In addition to the normal key description (which can be
              generated by the parser), a number of supplementary
              identifiers may be available that can be searched for.
              These may be obtained, for example, by hashing the public
              key material or from the subjectKeyIdentifier in an X.509
              certificate.

              Identifier-based searches are selected by passing as the
              description to <b>keyctl_search</b>() a string constructed of hex
              characters prefixed with either "id:" or "ex:".  The "id:"
              prefix indicates that a partial tail match is permissible
              whereas "ex:" requires an exact match on the full string.
              The hex characters indicate the data to match.

       Subtype
              This is the driver inside the kernel that accesses the key
              material and performs operations on it.  It might be
              entirely software-based or it may offload the operations
              to a hardware key store, such as a <b>TPM</b>.

       Note that expiry times from the payload are ignored as these
       patches may be used during boot before the system clock is set.
