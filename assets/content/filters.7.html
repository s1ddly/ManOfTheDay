     The smtpd(8) daemon provides a Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
     implementation that allows an ordinary machine to become Mail
     eXchangers (MX).  Many features that are commonly used by MX, such
     as delivery reporting or Spam filtering, are outside the scope of
     SMTP and too complex to fit in smtpd(8).

     Because an MX needs to provide these features, smtpd(8) provides an
     API to extend its behavior through pluggable <b>filters</b>.

     At runtime, smtpd(8) can report events to <b>filters </b>and query what it
     should answer to these events.  This allows the decision logic to
     rely on third-party programs.
