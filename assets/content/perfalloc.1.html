       <b>perfalloc </b>is a command that notifies the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmdaperfevent.1.html">pmdaperfevent(1)</a> to
       disable hardware counter event collection.  This allow
       unprivileged processes to use the hardware counters.

       If the reservation request fails, then perfalloc exits
       immediately with exit code EXIT_FAILURE.  If successful, the
       perfalloc will run until a kill signal is received.  The
       reservation request persists while perfalloc is running.

       Note that <b>pmdaperfevent </b>is affected by the value of the
       <i>kernel.perf_event_paranoid</i> setting, which can be adjusted by
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/sysctl.8.html">sysctl(8)</a>.

       If a commandline is given, this is executed as a subprocess of
       the agent.  When the command dies, so does the agent.

       A brief description of the command line options follows:

       <b>-D   </b>run in the foreground (the default)

       <b>-d   </b>run in the background

       <b>-f FILE</b>
            use FILE as the lock file (default
            $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/perfevent/perflock)

       <b>-h   </b>display a help message and exit

       <b>-v   </b>output version number and exit
