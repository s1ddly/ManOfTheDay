       “<b>stat overrides</b>” are a way to tell <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dpkg.1.html">dpkg(1)</a> to use a different
       owner or mode for a path when a package is installed (this
       applies to any filesystem object that <b>dpkg </b>handles, including
       directories, devices, etc.). This can be used to force programs
       that are normally setuid to be install without a setuid flag, or
       only executable by a certain group.

       <b>dpkg-statoverride </b>is a utility to manage the list of stat
       overrides. It has three basic functions: adding, removing and
       listing overrides.
