       <b>dh_installdebconf </b>is a debhelper program that is responsible for
       installing files used by debconf into package build directories.

       It also automatically generates the <i>postrm</i> commands needed to
       interface with debconf. The commands are added to the maintainer
       scripts by <b>dh_installdeb</b>. See <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dh_installdeb.1.html">dh_installdeb(1)</a> for an explanation
       of how that works.

       Note that if you use debconf, your package probably needs to
       depend on it (it will be added to <b>${misc:Depends} </b>by this
       program).

       Note that for your config script to be called by <b>dpkg</b>, your
       <i>postinst</i> needs to source debconf's confmodule. <b>dh_installdebconf</b>
       does not install this statement into the <i>postinst</i> automatically
       as it is too hard to do it right.
