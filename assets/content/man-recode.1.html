       <b>man-recode </b>converts multiple manual pages from one encoding to
       another, guessing the appropriate input encoding for each one.
       It is useful when permanently recoding pages written in legacy
       character sets, or in build systems that need to recode a set of
       pages to a single common encoding (usually UTF-8) for
       installation.  When converting many manual pages, this program is
       much faster than running <b>man --recode </b>or <b>manconv </b>on each page.

       If an encoding declaration is found on the first line of a manual
       page, then that declaration is used as the input encoding for
       that page.  Failing that, the input encoding is guessed based on
       the file name.

       Encoding declarations have the following form:

              '\" -*- coding: UTF-8 -*-

       or (if manual page preprocessors are also to be declared):

              '\" t -*- coding: ISO-8859-1 -*-
