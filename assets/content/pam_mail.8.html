       The pam_mail PAM module provides the "you have new mail" service
       to the user. It can be plugged into any application that has
       credential or session hooks. It gives a single message indicating
       the <i>newness</i> of any mail it finds in the user's mail folder. This
       module also sets the PAM environment variable, <b>MAIL</b>, to the
       user's mail directory.

       If the mail spool file (be it /var/mail/$USER or a pathname given
       with the <b>dir= </b>parameter) is a directory then pam_mail assumes it
       is in the <i>Maildir</i> format.
