       <b>nitrocli </b>provides access to Nitrokey devices.  It supports the
       Nitrokey Pro, the Nitrokey Storage, and the Librem Key.  It can
       be used to access the encrypted volume, the one-time password
       generator, and the password safe.

   <b>Device selection</b>
       Per default, <b>nitrocli </b>connects to any attached Nitrokey device.
       You can use the <b>--model</b>, <b>--serial-number </b>and <b>--usb-path </b>options
       to select the device to connect to.  <b>nitrocli </b>fails if more than
       one attached Nitrokey device matches this filter or if multiple
       Nitrokey devices are attached and none of the filter options is
       set.  Use the <b>list </b>command to list all attached devices with
       their USB path, model, and serial number (if available).
