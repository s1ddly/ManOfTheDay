       <b>pmdaweblog </b>is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/PMDA.3.html">PMDA(3)</a>) that
       scans Web server logs to extract metrics characterizing Web
       server activity.  These performance metrics are then made
       available through the infrastructure of the Performance Co-Pilot
       (PCP).

       The <i>configfile</i> specifies which Web servers are to be monitored,
       their associated access logs and error logs, and a regular-
       expression based scheme for extracting detailed information about
       each Web access.  This file is maintained as part of the PMDA
       installation and/or de-installation by the scripts <b>Install </b>and
       <b>Remove </b>in the directory <b>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/weblog</b>.  For more details,
       refer to the section below covering installation.

       Once started, <b>pmdaweblog </b>monitors a set of log files and in
       response to a request for information, will process any new
       information that has been appended to the log files, similar to a
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/tail.1.html">tail(1)</a>.  There is also periodic "catch up" to process new
       information from all log files, and a scheme to detect the
       rotation of log files.

       Like all other PMDAs, <b>pmdaweblog </b>is launched by <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> using
       command line options specified in <i>$PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH</i> - the
       <b>Install </b>script will prompt for appropriate values for the command
       line options, and update <i>$PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH</i>.

       A brief description of the <b>pmdaweblog </b>command line options
       follows:

       <b>-C     </b>Check the configuration and exit.

       <b>-d </b><i>domain</i>
              Specify the <i>domain</i> number.  It is absolutely crucial that
              the performance metrics <i>domain</i> number specified here is
              unique and consistent.  That is, <i>domain</i> should be
              different for every PMDA on the one host, and the same
              <i>domain</i> number should be used for the <b>pmdaweblog </b>PMDA on
              all hosts.

              For most installations, the default <i>domain</i> as encapsulated
              in the file <b>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/weblog/domain.h </b>will suffice.
              For alternate values, check <i>$PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH</i> for the
              <i>domain</i> values already in use on this host, and the file
              <b>$PCP_VAR_DIR/pmns/stdpmid </b>contains a repository of ``well
              known'' <i>domain</i> assignments that probably should be
              avoided.

       <b>-h </b><i>helpfile</i>
              Get the help text from the supplied <i>helpfile</i> rather than
              from the default location.

       <b>-i </b><i>port</i>
              Communicate with <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> on the specified Internet <i>port</i>
              (which may be a number or a name).

       <b>-l </b><i>logfile</i>
              Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
              <i>weblog.log</i> is written in the current directory of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a>
              when <b>pmdaweblog </b>is started, i.e.  <b>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd</b>.  If
              the log file cannot be created or is not writable, output
              is written to the standard error instead.

       <b>-n </b><i>idlesec</i>
              If a Web server log file has not been modified for <i>idlesec</i>
              seconds, then the file will be closed and re-opened.  This
              is the only way <b>pmdaweblog </b>can detect any asynchronous
              rotation of the logs by Web server administrative scripts.
              The default period is 20 seconds.  This value may be
              changed dynamically using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmstore.1.html">pmstore(1)</a> to modify the value
              of the performance metric <b>web.config.check</b>.

       <b>-p     </b>Communicate with <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> via a pipe.

       <b>-S </b><i>num</i> Specify the maximum number of Web servers per <i>sproc</i>.  It
              may be desirable (from a latency and load balancing
              perspective) or necessary (due to file descriptor limits)
              to delegate responsibility for scanning the Web server log
              files to several <i>sprocs</i>.  <b>pmdaweblog </b>will ensure that each
              <i>sproc</i> handles the log files for at most <i>num</i> Web servers.
              The default value is 80 Web servers per <i>sproc</i>.

       <b>-t </b><i>delay</i>
              To avoid the need to scan a lot of information from the
              Web server logs in response to a single request for
              performance metrics, all log files will be checked at
              least once every <i>delay</i> seconds.  The default is 15
              seconds.  This value may by changed dynamically using
              <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmstore.1.html">pmstore(1)</a> to modify the value of the performance metric
              <b>web.config.catchup</b>.

       <b>-u </b><i>socket</i>
              Communicate with <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> via the given Unix domain <i>socket</i>.

       <b>-U     </b>User account under which to run the agent.  The default is
              the unprivileged "pcp" account in current versions of PCP,
              but in older versions the superuser account ("root") was
              used by default.
