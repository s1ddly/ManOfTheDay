       The programs <b>ld.so </b>and <b>ld-linux.so* </b>find and load the shared
       objects (shared libraries) needed by a program, prepare the
       program to run, and then run it.

       Linux binaries require dynamic linking (linking at run time)
       unless the <b>-static </b>option was given to <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ld.1.html">ld(1)</a> during compilation.

       The program <b>ld.so </b>handles a.out binaries, a binary format used
       long ago.  The program <b>ld-linux.so* </b>(<i>/lib/ld-linux.so.1</i> for
       libc5, <i>/lib/ld-linux.so.2</i> for glibc2) handles binaries that are
       in the more modern ELF format.  Both programs have the same
       behavior, and use the same support files and programs (<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ldd.1.html">ldd(1)</a>,
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ldconfig.8.html">ldconfig(8)</a>, and <i>/etc/ld.so.conf</i>).

       When resolving shared object dependencies, the dynamic linker
       first inspects each dependency string to see if it contains a
       slash (this can occur if a shared object pathname containing
       slashes was specified at link time).  If a slash is found, then
       the dependency string is interpreted as a (relative or absolute)
       pathname, and the shared object is loaded using that pathname.

       If a shared object dependency does not contain a slash, then it
       is searched for in the following order:

       o  Using the directories specified in the DT_RPATH dynamic
          section attribute of the binary if present and DT_RUNPATH
          attribute does not exist.  Use of DT_RPATH is deprecated.

       o  Using the environment variable <b>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</b>, unless the
          executable is being run in secure-execution mode (see below),
          in which case this variable is ignored.

       o  Using the directories specified in the DT_RUNPATH dynamic
          section attribute of the binary if present.  Such directories
          are searched only to find those objects required by DT_NEEDED
          (direct dependencies) entries and do not apply to those
          objects' children, which must themselves have their own
          DT_RUNPATH entries.  This is unlike DT_RPATH, which is applied
          to searches for all children in the dependency tree.

       o  From the cache file <i>/etc/ld.so.cache</i>, which contains a
          compiled list of candidate shared objects previously found in
          the augmented library path.  If, however, the binary was
          linked with the <b>-z nodeflib </b>linker option, shared objects in
          the default paths are skipped.  Shared objects installed in
          hardware capability directories (see below) are preferred to
          other shared objects.

       o  In the default path <i>/lib</i>, and then <i>/usr/lib</i>.  (On some 64-bit
          architectures, the default paths for 64-bit shared objects are
          <i>/lib64</i>, and then <i>/usr/lib64</i>.)  If the binary was linked with
          the <b>-z nodeflib </b>linker option, this step is skipped.

   <b>Dynamic string tokens</b>
       In several places, the dynamic linker expands dynamic string
       tokens:

       o  In the environment variables <b>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</b>, <b>LD_PRELOAD</b>, and
          <b>LD_AUDIT</b>,

       o  inside the values of the dynamic section tags <b>DT_NEEDED</b>,
          <b>DT_RPATH</b>, <b>DT_RUNPATH</b>, <b>DT_AUDIT</b>, and <b>DT_DEPAUDIT </b>of ELF
          binaries,

       o  in the arguments to the <b>ld.so </b>command line options <b>--audit</b>,
          <b>--library-path</b>, and <b>--preload </b>(see below), and

       o  in the filename arguments to the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/dlopen.3.html">dlopen(3)</a> and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/dlmopen.3.html">dlmopen(3)</a>
          functions.

       The substituted tokens are as follows:

       <i>$ORIGIN</i> (or equivalently <i>${ORIGIN}</i>)
              This expands to the directory containing the program or
              shared object.  Thus, an application located in
              <i>somedir/app</i> could be compiled with

                  gcc -Wl,-rpath,'$ORIGIN/../lib'

              so that it finds an associated shared object in
              <i>somedir/lib</i> no matter where <i>somedir</i> is located in the
              directory hierarchy.  This facilitates the creation of
              "turn-key" applications that do not need to be installed
              into special directories, but can instead be unpacked into
              any directory and still find their own shared objects.

       <i>$LIB</i> (or equivalently <i>${LIB}</i>)
              This expands to <i>lib</i> or <i>lib64</i> depending on the architecture
              (e.g., on x86-64, it expands to <i>lib64</i> and on x86-32, it
              expands to <i>lib</i>).

       <i>$PLATFORM</i> (or equivalently <i>${PLATFORM}</i>)
              This expands to a string corresponding to the processor
              type of the host system (e.g., "x86_64").  On some
              architectures, the Linux kernel doesn't provide a platform
              string to the dynamic linker.  The value of this string is
              taken from the <b>AT_PLATFORM </b>value in the auxiliary vector
              (see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/getauxval.3.html">getauxval(3)</a>).

       Note that the dynamic string tokens have to be quoted properly
       when set from a shell, to prevent their expansion as shell or
       environment variables.
