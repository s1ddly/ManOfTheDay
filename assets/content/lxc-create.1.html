       <b>lxc-create </b>creates a system object where is stored the
       configuration information and where can be stored user
       information. The identifier <i>name</i> is used to specify the container
       to be used with the different lxc commands.

       The object is a directory created in <i>/usr/local/var/lib/lxc</i> and
       identified by its name.

       The object is the definition of the different resources an
       application can use or can see. The more the configuration file
       contains information, the more the container is isolated and the
       more the application is jailed.

       If the configuration file <i>config_file</i> is not specified, the
       container will be created with the default isolation: processes,
       sysv ipc and mount points.
