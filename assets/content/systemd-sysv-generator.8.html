       systemd-sysv-generator is a generator that creates wrapper
       .service units for <b>SysV init</b><b></b>[1] scripts in /etc/init.d/* at boot
       and when configuration of the system manager is reloaded. This
       will allow <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/systemd.1.html">systemd(1)</a> to support them similarly to native units.

       <b>LSB headers</b><b></b>[2] in SysV init scripts are interpreted, and the
       ordering specified in the header is turned into dependencies
       between the generated unit and other units. The LSB facilities
       "$remote_fs", "$network", "$named", "$portmap", "$time" are
       supported and will be turned into dependencies on specific native
       systemd targets. See <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/systemd.special.7.html">systemd.special(7)</a> for more details.

       SysV runlevels have corresponding systemd targets
       (runlevel<i>X</i>.target). The wrapper unit that is generated will be
       wanted by those targets which correspond to runlevels for which
       the script is enabled.

       <b>systemd </b>does not support SysV scripts as part of early boot, so
       all wrapper units are ordered after basic.target.

       systemd-sysv-generator implements <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/systemd.generator.7.html">systemd.generator(7)</a>.
