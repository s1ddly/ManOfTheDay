       This is usually not what an end user wants to run directly. See
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/git-commit.1.html">git-commit(1)</a> instead.

       Creates a new commit object based on the provided tree object and
       emits the new commit object id on stdout. The log message is read
       from the standard input, unless <b>-m </b>or <b>-F </b>options are given.

       The <b>-m </b>and <b>-F </b>options can be given any number of times, in any
       order. The commit log message will be composed in the order in
       which the options are given.

       A commit object may have any number of parents. With exactly one
       parent, it is an ordinary commit. Having more than one parent
       makes the commit a merge between several lines of history.
       Initial (root) commits have no parents.

       While a tree represents a particular directory state of a working
       directory, a commit represents that state in "time", and explains
       how to get there.

       Normally a commit would identify a new "HEAD" state, and while
       Git doesnâ€™t care where you save the note about that state, in
       practice we tend to just write the result to the file that is
       pointed at by <b>.git/HEAD</b>, so that we can always see what the last
       committed state was.
