       Based on examination of the <i>linux/kernel/reboot.c</i> code, it is
       clear that there are two supported functions that the
       &lt;Ctrl-Alt-Del&gt; sequence can perform.

       <b>hard</b>
           Immediately reboot the computer without calling <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sync.2.html">sync(2)</a> and
           without any other preparation. This is the default.

       <b>soft</b>
           Make the kernel send the <b>SIGINT </b>(interrupt) signal to the
           <b>init </b>process (this is always the process with PID 1). If this
           option is used, the <b>init</b>(8) program must support this
           feature. Since there are now several <b>init</b>(8) programs in the
           Linux community, please consult the documentation for the
           version that you are currently using.

       When the command is run without any argument, it will display the
       current setting.

       The function of <b>ctrlaltdel </b>is usually set in the <i>/etc/rc.local</i>
       file.
