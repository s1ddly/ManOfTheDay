       Display file or file system status.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short
       options too.

       <b>-L</b>, <b>--dereference</b>
              follow links

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--file-system</b>
              display file system status instead of file status

       <b>--cached</b>=<i>MODE</i>
              specify how to use cached attributes; useful on remote
              file systems. See MODE below

       <b>-c  --format</b>=<i>FORMAT</i>
              use the specified FORMAT instead of the default; output a
              newline after each use of FORMAT

       <b>--printf</b>=<i>FORMAT</i>
              like <b>--format</b>, but interpret backslash escapes, and do not
              output a mandatory trailing newline; if you want a
              newline, include \n in FORMAT

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--terse</b>
              print the information in terse form

       <b>--help </b>display this help and exit

       <b>--version</b>
              output version information and exit

       The <b>--cached </b>MODE argument can be; always, never, or default.
       `always` will use cached attributes if available, while `never`
       will try to synchronize with the latest attributes, and `default`
       will leave it up to the underlying file system.

       The valid format sequences for files (without <b>--file-system</b>):

       %a     permission bits in octal (note '#' and '0' printf flags)

       %A     permission bits and file type in human readable form

       %b     number of blocks allocated (see %B)

       %B     the size in bytes of each block reported by %b

       %C     SELinux security context string

       %d     device number in decimal

       %D     device number in hex

       %f     raw mode in hex

       %F     file type

       %g     group ID of owner

       %G     group name of owner

       %h     number of hard links

       %i     inode number

       %m     mount point

       %n     file name

       %N     quoted file name with dereference if symbolic link

       %o     optimal I/O transfer size hint

       %s     total size, in bytes

       %t     major device type in hex, for character/block device
              special files

       %T     minor device type in hex, for character/block device
              special files

       %u     user ID of owner

       %U     user name of owner

       %w     time of file birth, human-readable; - if unknown

       %W     time of file birth, seconds since Epoch; 0 if unknown

       %x     time of last access, human-readable

       %X     time of last access, seconds since Epoch

       %y     time of last data modification, human-readable

       %Y     time of last data modification, seconds since Epoch

       %z     time of last status change, human-readable

       %Z     time of last status change, seconds since Epoch

       Valid format sequences for file systems:

       %a     free blocks available to non-superuser

       %b     total data blocks in file system

       %c     total file nodes in file system

       %d     free file nodes in file system

       %f     free blocks in file system

       %i     file system ID in hex

       %l     maximum length of filenames

       %n     file name

       %s     block size (for faster transfers)

       %S     fundamental block size (for block counts)

       %t     file system type in hex

       %T     file system type in human readable form

   <b>--terse is equivalent to the following FORMAT:</b>
              %n %s %b %f %u %g %D %i %h %t %T %X %Y %Z %W %o %C

   <b>--terse --file-system is equivalent to the following FORMAT:</b>
              %n %i %l %t %s %S %b %f %a %c %d

       NOTE: your shell may have its own version of stat, which usually
       supersedes the version described here.  Please refer to your
       shell's documentation for details about the options it supports.
