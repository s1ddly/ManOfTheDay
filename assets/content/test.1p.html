<pre>
       The <i>test</i> utility shall evaluate the <i>expression</i> and indicate the
       result of the evaluation by its exit status. An exit status of
       zero indicates that the expression evaluated as true and an exit
       status of 1 indicates that the expression evaluated as false.

       In the second form of the utility, where the utility name used is
       <i>[</i> rather than <i>test</i>, the application shall ensure that the closing
       square bracket is a separate argument. The <i>test</i> and <i>[</i> utilities
       may be implemented as a single linked utility which examines the
       basename of the zeroth command line argument to determine whether
       to behave as the <i>test</i> or <i>[</i> variant. Applications using the <i>exec</i>()
       family of functions to execute these utilities shall ensure that
       the argument passed in <i>arg0</i> or <i>argv</i>[0] is <b>'[' </b>when executing the
       <i>[</i> utility and has a basename of <b>"test" </b>when executing the <i>test</i>
       utility.
