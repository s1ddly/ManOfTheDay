       A batch job is deleted by sending a request to the batch server
       that manages the batch job. A batch job that has been deleted is
       no longer subject to management by batch services.

       The <i>qdel</i> utility is a user-accessible client of batch services
       that requests the deletion of one or more batch jobs.

       The <i>qdel</i> utility shall request a batch server to delete those
       batch jobs for which a batch <i>job_identifier</i> is presented to the
       utility.

       The <i>qdel</i> utility shall delete batch jobs in the order in which
       their batch <i>job_identifier</i>s are presented to the utility.

       If the <i>qdel</i> utility fails to process any batch <i>job_identifier</i>
       successfully, the utility shall proceed to process the remaining
       batch <i>job_identifier</i>s, if any.

       The <i>qdel</i> utility shall delete each batch job by sending a <i>Delete</i>
       <i>Job Request</i> to the batch server that manages the batch job.

       The <i>qdel</i> utility shall not exit until the batch job corresponding
       to each successfully processed batch <i>job_identifier</i> has been
       deleted.
