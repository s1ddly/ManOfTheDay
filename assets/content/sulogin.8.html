       <b>sulogin </b>is invoked by <b>init </b>when the system goes into single-user
       mode.

       The user is prompted:

       Give root password for system maintenance (or type Control-D for
       normal startup):

       If the root account is locked and <b>--force </b>is specified, no
       password is required.

       <b>sulogin </b>will be connected to the current terminal, or to the
       optional <i>tty</i> device that can be specified on the command line
       (typically <i>/dev/console</i>).

       When the user exits from the single-user shell, or presses
       control-D at the prompt, the system will continue to boot.
