       <b>lsblk </b>lists information about all available or the specified
       block devices. The <b>lsblk </b>command reads the <b>sysfs </b>filesystem and
       <b>udev db </b>to gather information. If the udev db is not available or
       <b>lsblk </b>is compiled without udev support, then it tries to read
       LABELs, UUIDs and filesystem types from the block device. In this
       case root permissions are necessary.

       The command prints all block devices (except RAM disks) in a
       tree-like format by default. Use <b>lsblk --help </b>to get a list of
       all available columns.

       The default output, as well as the default output from options
       like <b>--fs </b>and <b>--topology</b>, is subject to change. So whenever
       possible, you should avoid using default outputs in your scripts.
       Always explicitly define expected columns by using <b>--output</b>
       <i>columns-list</i> and <b>--list </b>in environments where a stable output is
       required.

       Note that <b>lsblk </b>might be executed in time when <b>udev </b>does not have
       all information about recently added or modified devices yet. In
       this case it is recommended to use <b>udevadm settle </b>before <b>lsblk </b>to
       synchronize with udev.

       The relationship between block devices and filesystems is not
       always one-to-one. The filesystem may use more block devices, or
       the same filesystem may be accessible by more paths. This is the
       reason why <b>lsblk </b>provides MOUNTPOINT and MOUNTPOINTS (pl.)
       columns. The column MOUNTPOINT displays only one mount point
       (usually the last mounted instance of the filesystem), and the
       column MOUNTPOINTS displays by multi-line cell all mount points
       associated with the device.
