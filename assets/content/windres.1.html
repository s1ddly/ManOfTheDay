       <b>windres </b>reads resources from an input file and copies them into
       an output file.  Either file may be in one of three formats:

       "rc"
           A text format read by the Resource Compiler.

       "res"
           A binary format generated by the Resource Compiler.

       "coff"
           A COFF object or executable.

       The exact description of these different formats is available in
       documentation from Microsoft.

       When <b>windres </b>converts from the "rc" format to the "res" format,
       it is acting like the Windows Resource Compiler.  When <b>windres</b>
       converts from the "res" format to the "coff" format, it is acting
       like the Windows "CVTRES" program.

       When <b>windres </b>generates an "rc" file, the output is similar but
       not identical to the format expected for the input.  When an
       input "rc" file refers to an external filename, an output "rc"
       file will instead include the file contents.

       If the input or output format is not specified, <b>windres </b>will
       guess based on the file name, or, for the input file, the file
       contents.  A file with an extension of <i>.rc</i> will be treated as an
       "rc" file, a file with an extension of <i>.res</i> will be treated as a
       "res" file, and a file with an extension of <i>.o</i> or <i>.exe</i> will be
       treated as a "coff" file.

       If no output file is specified, <b>windres </b>will print the resources
       in "rc" format to standard output.

       The normal use is for you to write an "rc" file, use <b>windres </b>to
       convert it to a COFF object file, and then link the COFF file
       into your application.  This will make the resources described in
       the "rc" file available to Windows.
