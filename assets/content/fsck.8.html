       <b>fsck </b>is used to check and optionally repair one or more Linux
       filesystems. <i>filesystem</i> can be a device name (e.g., <i>/dev/hdc1</i>,
       <i>/dev/sdb2</i>), a mount point (e.g., <i>/</i>, <i>/usr</i>, <i>/home</i>), or an
       filesystem label or UUID specifier (e.g.,
       UUID=8868abf6-88c5-4a83-98b8-bfc24057f7bd or LABEL=root).
       Normally, the <b>fsck </b>program will try to handle filesystems on
       different physical disk drives in parallel to reduce the total
       amount of time needed to check all of them.

       If no filesystems are specified on the command line, and the <b>-A</b>
       option is not specified, <b>fsck </b>will default to checking
       filesystems in <i>/etc/fstab</i> serially. This is equivalent to the <b>-As</b>
       options.

       The exit status returned by <b>fsck </b>is the sum of the following
       conditions:

       <b>0</b>
           No errors

       <b>1</b>
           Filesystem errors corrected

       <b>2</b>
           System should be rebooted

       <b>4</b>
           Filesystem errors left uncorrected

       <b>8</b>
           Operational error

       <b>16</b>
           Usage or syntax error

       <b>32</b>
           Checking canceled by user request

       <b>128</b>
           Shared-library error

       The exit status returned when multiple filesystems are checked is
       the bit-wise OR of the exit statuses for each filesystem that is
       checked.

       In actuality, <b>fsck </b>is simply a front-end for the various
       filesystem checkers (<b>fsck</b>.<i>fstype</i>) available under Linux. The
       filesystem-specific checker is searched for in the <b>PATH</b>
       environment variable. If the <b>PATH </b>is undefined then fallback to
       <i>/sbin</i>.

       Please see the filesystem-specific checker manual pages for
       further details.
