       A collection of one or more Performance Co-Pilot (see
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/PCPIntro.1.html">PCPIntro(1)</a>) archive logs may be combined with <b>mkaf </b>to produce a
       PCP archive folio and the associated archive folio control file.
       Some PCP tools use <b>mkaf </b>to create archive folios, e.g. the
       ``record'' facility in the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmchart.1.html">pmchart(1)</a> and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmview.1.html">pmview(1)</a> tools, to
       facilitate playback with <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmafm.1.html">pmafm(1)</a>.

       <b>mkaf </b>processes each <i>filename</i> argument, and if this is a component
       file from a PCP archive that archive is added to the folio.

       If <i>filename</i> is a directory, then this is searched recursively
       using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/find.1.html">find(1)</a>.  Any <i>filename</i> argument beginning with a ``-'' is
       assumed to be a <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/find.1.html">find(1)</a> command line option (<i>findopts</i>); the
       default is <b>-follow </b>if no <i>findopts</i> are specified.

       The first named archive in the folio is assumed to be associated
       with the default host for any tool that tries to replay multiple
       archives from the folio.

       The folio control file is written to standard output, and has the
       following format.

       1. The first line contains the word <b>PCPFolio</b>.

       2. The second line contains the tag <b>Version: </b>followed by the
          format version number (currently 1).

       3. For subsequent lines, blank lines and lines beginning with
          ``#'' are ignored.

       4. The line beginning with the tag <b>Created: </b>documents where and
          when the folio was created.

       5. The line beginning with the tag <b>Creator: </b>identifies the tool
          which created the folio (and is assumed to know how to replay
          the archive folio).  If present, the second argument is the
          name of a configuration file that the creator tool could use
          to replay the archive folio, e.g. with the <b>replay </b>command for
          <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmafm.1.html">pmafm(1)</a>.  In the case of <b>mkaf </b>(unlike <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmchart.1.html">pmchart(1)</a> or
          <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmview.1.html">pmview(1)</a>) there is no knowledge of the contents of the
          archives, so the ``creator'' cannot replay the archive,
          however <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmchart.1.html">pmchart(1)</a> is able to replay any archive, and so this
          tool is identified as the <b>Creator: </b>for archive folios created
          by <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/mkaf.1.html">mkaf(1)</a>.

       6. This is then followed by one or more lines beginning with the
          tag <b>Archive: </b>followed by the hostname and base name of the
          archive.

       For example
            $ mkaf mydir/gonzo
       might produce the following folio control file.

       PCPFolio
       Version: 1
       # use pmafm(1) to process this PCP archive folio
