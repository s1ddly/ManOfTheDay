       The <i>make</i> utility shall update files that are derived from other
       files. A typical case is one where object files are derived from
       the corresponding source files. The <i>make</i> utility examines time
       relationships and shall update those derived files (called
       targets) that have modified times earlier than the modified times
       of the files (called prerequisites) from which they are derived.
       A description file (makefile) contains a description of the
       relationships between files, and the commands that need to be
       executed to update the targets to reflect changes in their
       prerequisites. Each specification, or rule, shall consist of a
       target, optional prerequisites, and optional commands to be
       executed when a prerequisite is newer than the target. There are
       two types of rule:

        1. <i>Inference rules</i>, which have one target name with at least one
           &lt;period&gt; (<b>'.'</b>)  and no &lt;slash&gt; (<b>'/'</b>)

        2. <i>Target rules</i>, which can have more than one target name

       In addition, <i>make</i> shall have a collection of built-in macros and
       inference rules that infer prerequisite relationships to simplify
       maintenance of programs.

       To receive exactly the behavior described in this section, the
       user shall ensure that a portable makefile shall:

        *  Include the special target <b>.POSIX</b>

        *  Omit any special target reserved for implementations (a
           leading period followed by uppercase letters) that has not
           been specified by this section

       The behavior of <i>make</i> is unspecified if either or both of these
       conditions are not met.
