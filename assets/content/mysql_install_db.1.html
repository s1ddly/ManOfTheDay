       <b>mysql_install_db </b>initializes the MariaDB data directory and
       creates the system tables that it contains, if they do not exist.

       To invoke <b>mysql_install_db</b>, use the following syntax:

           shell&gt; <b>mysql_install_db [</b><i>options</i><b>]</b>

       Because the MariaDB server, <b>mysqld</b>, needs to access the data
       directory when it runs later, you should either run
       <b>mysql_install_db </b>from the same account that will be used for
       running <b>mysqld </b>or run it as root and use the <b>--user </b>option to
       indicate the user name that <b>mysqld </b>will run as. It might be
       necessary to specify other options such as <b>--basedir </b>or <b>--datadir</b>
       if <b>mysql_install_db </b>does not use the correct locations for the
       installation directory or data directory. For example:

           shell&gt; <b>bin/mysql_install_db --user=mysql \</b>
                    <b>--basedir=/opt/mysql/mysql \</b>
                    <b>--datadir=/opt/mysql/mysql/data</b>

       <b>mysql_install_db </b>needs to invoke <b>mysqld </b>with the <b>--bootstrap </b>and
       <b>--skip-grant-tables </b>options (see Section 2.3.2, “Typical
       configure Options”). If MariaDB was configured with the
       <b>--disable-grant-options </b>option, <b>--bootstrap </b>and
       <b>--skip-grant-tables </b>will be disabled. To handle this, set the
       MYSQLD_BOOTSTRAP environment variable to the full path name of a
       server that has all options enabled.  <b>mysql_install_db </b>will use
       that server.

       <b>mysql_install_db </b>supports the following options, which can be
       specified on the command line or in the [mysql_install_db] and
       (if they are common to <b>mysqld</b>) [mysqld] option file groups.

       •   <b>--basedir=</b><i>path</i>

           The path to the MariaDB installation directory.

       •   <b>--builddir=</b><i>path</i>

           If using <b>--srcdir </b>with out-of-directory builds, you will need
           to set this to the location of the build directory where
           built files reside..

       •   <b>--cross-bootstrap</b>

           For internal use. Used when building the MariaDB system
           tables on a different host than the target..

       •   <b>--datadir=</b><i>path</i>, <b>--ldata=</b><i>path</i>

           The path to the MariaDB data directory.

       •   <b>--defaults-extra-file=</b><i>filename</i>

           Set <i>filename</i> as the file to read default options from after
           the global defaults files has been read.  Must be given as
           first option.

       •   <b>--defaults-file=</b><i>filename</i>

           Set <i>filename</i> as the file to read default options from,
           override global defaults files.  Must be given as first
           option.

       •   <b>--defaults-group-suffix=</b><i>name</i>

           In addition to the given groups, also read groups with this
           suffix.

       •   <b>--force</b>

           Cause <b>mysql_install_db </b>to run even if DNS does not work. In
           that case, grant table entries that normally use host names
           will use IP addresses.

       •   <b>--help</b>

           Display a help message and exit.

       •   <b>--no-defaults</b>

           Do not read default options from any option file. This must
           be given as the first argument.

       •   <b>--print-defaults</b>

           Print the program argument list and exit.  This must be given
           as the first argument.

       •   <b>--rpm</b>

           For internal use. This option is used by RPM files during the
           MariaDB installation process.

       •   <b>--skip-name-resolve</b>

           Use IP addresses rather than host names when creating grant
           table entries. This option can be useful if your DNS does not
           work.

       •   <b>--srcdir=</b><i>path</i>

           For internal use. The directory under which <b>mysql_install_db</b>
           looks for support files such as the error message file and
           the file for populating the help tables.4.

       •   <b>--user=</b><i>user_name</i>

           The login user name to use for running <b>mysqld</b>. Files and
           directories created by <b>mysqld </b>will be owned by this user. You
           must be root to use this option. By default, <b>mysqld </b>runs
           using your current login name and files and directories that
           it creates will be owned by you.

       •   <b>--verbose</b>

           Verbose mode. Print more information about what the program
           does.

       •   <b>--windows</b>

           For internal use. This option is used for creating Windows
           distributions.
