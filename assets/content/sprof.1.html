       The <b>sprof </b>command displays a profiling summary for the shared
       object (shared library) specified as its first command-line
       argument.  The profiling summary is created using previously
       generated profiling data in the (optional) second command-line
       argument.  If the profiling data pathname is omitted, then <b>sprof</b>
       will attempt to deduce it using the soname of the shared object,
       looking for a file with the name <i>&lt;soname&gt;.profile</i> in the current
       directory.
