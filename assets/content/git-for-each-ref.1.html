       Iterate over all refs that match <b>&lt;pattern&gt; </b>and show them
       according to the given <b>&lt;format&gt;</b>, after sorting them according to
       the given set of <b>&lt;key&gt;</b>. If <b>&lt;count&gt; </b>is given, stop after showing
       that many refs. The interpolated values in <b>&lt;format&gt; </b>can
       optionally be quoted as string literals in the specified host
       language allowing their direct evaluation in that language.
