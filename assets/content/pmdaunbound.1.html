       <b>pmdaunbound </b>is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
       exports metric values about the Unbound DNS resolver using the
       <b>unbound-control</b>(8) <b>stats_noreset </b>command.

       This gives lots of insight into query types, response time, cache
       hits/misses, etc. Please see the <b>unbound-control</b>(8) man page for
       explanation about each statistics counter.

       Further details on the Unbound DNS resolver can be found at
       <b><a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pagestps://unbound.net/">https://unbound.net/</a> </b>.
