       Backends are a special type of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/filter.7.html">filter(7)</a> which is used to send
       print data to and discover different devices on the system.

       Like filters, backends must be capable of reading from a filename
       on the command-line or from the standard input, copying the
       standard input to a temporary file as required by the physical
       interface.

       The command name (<i>argv[0]</i>) is set to the device URI of the
       destination printer.  Authentication information in <i>argv[0]</i> is
       removed, so backend developers are urged to use the <b>DEVICE_URI</b>
       environment variable whenever authentication information is
       required. The <b>cupsBackendDeviceURI</b>() function may be used to
       retrieve the correct device URI.

       Back-channel data from the device should be relayed to the job
       filters using the <i>cupsBackChannelWrite</i> function.

       Backends are responsible for reading side-channel requests using
       the <b>cupsSideChannelRead</b>() function and responding with the
       <b>cupsSideChannelWrite</b>() function. The <b>CUPS_SC_FD </b>constant defines
       the file descriptor that should be monitored for incoming
       requests.

   <b>DEVICE DISCOVERY</b>
       When run with no arguments, the backend should list the devices
       and schemes it supports or is advertising to the standard output.
       The output consists of zero or more lines consisting of any of
       the following forms:

           device-class scheme "Unknown" "device-info"
           device-class device-uri "device-make-and-model" "device-info"
           device-class device-uri "device-make-and-model" "device-info" "device-id"
           device-class device-uri "device-make-and-model" "device-info" "device-id" "device-location"

       The <b>cupsBackendReport</b>() function can be used to generate these
       lines and handle any necessary escaping of characters in the
       various strings.

       The <i>device-class</i> field is one of the following values:

       <b>direct</b>
            The device-uri refers to a specific direct-access device
            with no options, such as a parallel, USB, or SCSI device.

       <b>file </b>The device-uri refers to a file on disk.

       <b>network</b>
            The device-uri refers to a networked device and conforms to
            the general form for network URIs.

       <b>serial</b>
            The device-uri refers to a serial device with configurable
            baud rate and other options.  If the device-uri contains a
            baud value, it represents the maximum baud rate supported by
            the device.

       The <i>scheme</i> field provides the URI scheme that is supported by the
       backend.  Backends should use this form only when the backend
       supports any URI using that scheme.  The <i>device-uri</i> field
       specifies the full URI to use when communicating with the device.

       The <i>device-make-and-model</i> field specifies the make and model of
       the device, e.g. "Example Foojet 2000".  If the make and model is
       not known, you must report "Unknown".

       The <i>device-info</i> field specifies additional information about the
       device.  Typically this includes the make and model along with
       the port number or network address, e.g. "Example Foojet 2000 USB
       #1".

       The optional <i>device-id</i> field specifies the IEEE-1284 device ID
       string for the device, which is used to select a matching driver.

       The optional <i>device-location</i> field specifies the physical
       location of the device, which is often used to pre-populate the
       printer-location attribute when adding a printer.

   <b>PERMISSIONS</b>
       Backends without world read and execute permissions are run as
       the root user.  Otherwise, the backend is run using an
       unprivileged user account, typically "lp".
