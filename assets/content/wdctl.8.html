       Show hardware watchdog status. The default device is
       <i>/dev/watchdog</i>. If more than one device is specified then the
       output is separated by one blank line.

       If the device is already used or user has no permissions to read
       from the device, then <b>wdctl </b>reads data from sysfs. In this case
       information about supported features (flags) might be missing.

       Note that the number of supported watchdog features is hardware
       specific.
