       <b>lxc-cgroup </b>gets or sets the value of a <i>state-object</i> (e.g.,
       'cpuset.cpus') in the container's cgroup for the corresponding
       subsystem (e.g., 'cpuset'). If no [value] is specified, the
       current value of the <i>state-object</i> is displayed; otherwise it is
       set.

       Note that <b>lxc-cgroup </b>does not check that the <i>state-object</i> is
       valid for the running kernel, or that the corresponding subsystem
       is contained in any mounted cgroup hierarchy.
