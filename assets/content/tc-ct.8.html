       The ct action is a tc action for sending packets and interacting
       with the netfilter conntrack module.

       It can (as shown in the synopsis, in order):

       Send the packet to conntrack, and commit the connection, while
       configuring a 32bit mark, 128bit label, and src/dst nat.

       Send the packet to conntrack, which will mark the packet with the
       connection's state and configured metadata (mark/label), and
       execute previous configured nat.

       Clear the packet's of previous connection tracking state.
