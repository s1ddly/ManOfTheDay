       Help parsing or adding <i>trailers</i> lines, that look similar to RFC
       822 e-mail headers, at the end of the otherwise free-form part of
       a commit message.

       This command reads some patches or commit messages from either
       the &lt;file&gt; arguments or the standard input if no &lt;file&gt; is
       specified. If <b>--parse </b>is specified, the output consists of the
       parsed trailers.

       Otherwise, this command applies the arguments passed using the
       <b>--trailer </b>option, if any, to the commit message part of each
       input file. The result is emitted on the standard output.

       Some configuration variables control the way the <b>--trailer</b>
       arguments are applied to each commit message and the way any
       existing trailer in the commit message is changed. They also make
       it possible to automatically add some trailers.

       By default, a <i>&lt;token&gt;=&lt;value&gt;</i> or <i>&lt;token&gt;:&lt;value&gt;</i> argument given
       using <b>--trailer </b>will be appended after the existing trailers only
       if the last trailer has a different (&lt;token&gt;, &lt;value&gt;) pair (or
       if there is no existing trailer). The &lt;token&gt; and &lt;value&gt; parts
       will be trimmed to remove starting and trailing whitespace, and
       the resulting trimmed &lt;token&gt; and &lt;value&gt; will appear in the
       message like this:

           token: value

       This means that the trimmed &lt;token&gt; and &lt;value&gt; will be separated
       by <b>': ' </b>(one colon followed by one space).

       By default the new trailer will appear at the end of all the
       existing trailers. If there is no existing trailer, the new
       trailer will appear after the commit message part of the output,
       and, if there is no line with only spaces at the end of the
       commit message part, one blank line will be added before the new
       trailer.

       Existing trailers are extracted from the input message by looking
       for a group of one or more lines that (i) is all trailers, or
       (ii) contains at least one Git-generated or user-configured
       trailer and consists of at least 25% trailers. The group must be
       preceded by one or more empty (or whitespace-only) lines. The
       group must either be at the end of the message or be the last
       non-whitespace lines before a line that starts with <i>---</i> (followed
       by a space or the end of the line). Such three minus signs start
       the patch part of the message. See also <b>--no-divider </b>below.

       When reading trailers, there can be whitespaces after the token,
       the separator and the value. There can also be whitespaces inside
       the token and the value. The value may be split over multiple
       lines with each subsequent line starting with whitespace, like
       the "folding" in RFC 822.

       Note that <i>trailers</i> do not follow and are not intended to follow
       many rules for RFC 822 headers. For example they do not follow
       the encoding rules and probably many other rules.
