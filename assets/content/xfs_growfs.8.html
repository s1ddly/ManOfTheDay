       <b>xfs_growfs </b>expands an existing XFS filesystem (see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/xfs.5.html">xfs(5)</a>).  The
       <i>mount-point</i> argument is the pathname of the directory where the
       filesystem is mounted. The <i>block-device</i> argument is the device
       name of a mounted XFS filesystem.  The filesystem must be mounted
       to be grown (see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/mount.8.html">mount(8)</a>).  The existing contents of the
       filesystem are undisturbed, and the added space becomes available
       for additional file storage.
