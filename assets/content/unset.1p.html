       Each variable or function specified by <i>name</i> shall be unset.

       If <b>-v </b>is specified, <i>name</i> refers to a variable name and the shell
       shall unset it and remove it from the environment. Read-only
       variables cannot be unset.

       If <b>-f </b>is specified, <i>name</i> refers to a function and the shell shall
       unset the function definition.

       If neither <b>-f </b>nor <b>-v </b>is specified, <i>name</i> refers to a variable; if
       a variable by that name does not exist, it is unspecified whether
       a function by that name, if any, shall be unset.

       Unsetting a variable or function that was not previously set
       shall not be considered an error and does not cause the shell to
       abort.

       The <i>unset</i> special built-in shall support the Base Definitions
       volume of POSIX.1‚Äê2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>.

       Note that:

           VARIABLE=

       is not equivalent to an <i>unset</i> of <b>VARIABLE</b>; in the example,
       <b>VARIABLE </b>is set to <b>""</b>.  Also, the variables that can be <i>unset</i>
       should not be misinterpreted to include the special parameters
       (see <i>Section 2.5.2</i>, <i>Special Parameters</i>).
