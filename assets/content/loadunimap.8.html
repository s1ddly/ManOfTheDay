       The <b>loadunimap </b>command is obsolete - its function is now built-in
       into <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/setfont.8.html">setfont(8)</a>.  However, for backwards compatibility it is
       still available as a separate command.

       The program <b>loadunimap </b>loads the specified map in the kernel
       unicode-to-font mapping table.  If no map is given <i>def</i> mapping
       table is assumed.  The default extension (that can be omitted) is
       <i>.uni</i>.

       If the <b>-o </b><i>oldmap</i> option is given, the old map is saved in the
       file specified.

       On Linux 2.6.1 and later one can specify the console device using
       the <b>-C </b>option.

       Usually one does not call <b>loadunimap </b>directly - its function is
       also built into <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/setfont.8.html">setfont(8)</a>.
