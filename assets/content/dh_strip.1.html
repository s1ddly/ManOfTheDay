       <b>dh_strip </b>is a debhelper program that is responsible for stripping
       out debug symbols in executables, shared libraries, and static
       libraries that are not needed during execution.

       This program examines your package build directories and works
       out what to strip on its own. It uses <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/file.1.html">file(1)</a> and file
       permissions and filenames to figure out what files are shared
       libraries (<i>*.so</i>), executable binaries, and static (<i>lib*.a</i>) and
       debugging libraries (<i>lib*_g.a</i>, <i>debug/*.so</i>), and strips each as
       much as is possible. (Which is not at all for debugging
       libraries.) In general it seems to make very good guesses, and
       will do the right thing in almost all cases.

       Since it is very hard to automatically guess if a file is a
       module, and hard to determine how to strip a module, <b>dh_strip</b>
       does not currently deal with stripping binary modules such as <i>.o</i>
       files.
