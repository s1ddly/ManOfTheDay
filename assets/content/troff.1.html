       The GNU version of <i>troff</i> is the heart of the <i>groff</i> document
       formatting system.  <i>troff</i> is the <i>groff</i> system's formatter, the
       program that transforms <i>roff</i> language input into a device-
       independent output format.  It is functionally compatible with
       the AT&amp;T <i>troff</i> typesetter and features numerous extensions.  Many
       people prefer to use the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/groff.1.html">groff(1)</a> command, a front end which also
       runs preprocessors and output drivers in the appropriate order
       and with appropriate options.
