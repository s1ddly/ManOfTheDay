       <b>ps </b>displays information about a selection of the active
       processes.  If you want a repetitive update of the selection and
       the displayed information, use <b>top </b>instead.

       This version of <b>ps </b>accepts several kinds of options:

       1   UNIX options, which may be grouped and must be preceded by a
           dash.
       2   BSD options, which may be grouped and must not be used with a
           dash.
       3   GNU long options, which are preceded by two dashes.

       Options of different types may be freely mixed, but conflicts can
       appear.  There are some synonymous options, which are
       functionally identical, due to the many standards and <b>ps</b>
       implementations that this <b>ps </b>is compatible with.

       Note that <b>ps -aux </b>is distinct from <b>ps aux</b>.  The POSIX and UNIX
       standards require that <b>ps -aux </b>print all processes owned by a
       user named <i>x</i>, as well as printing all processes that would be
       selected by the <b>-a </b>option.  If the user named <i>x</i> does not exist,
       this <b>ps </b>may interpret the command as <b>ps aux </b>instead and print a
       warning.  This behavior is intended to aid in transitioning old
       scripts and habits.  It is fragile, subject to change, and thus
       should not be relied upon.

       By default, <b>ps </b>selects all processes with the same effective user
       ID (euid=EUID) as the current user and associated with the same
       terminal as the invoker.  It displays the process ID (pid=PID),
       the terminal associated with the process (tname=TTY), the
       cumulated CPU time in [DD-]hh:mm:ss format (time=TIME), and the
       executable name (ucmd=CMD).  Output is unsorted by default.

       The use of BSD-style options will add process state (stat=STAT)
       to the default display and show the command args (args=COMMAND)
       instead of the executable name.  You can override this with the
       <b>PS_FORMAT </b>environment variable.  The use of BSD-style options
       will also change the process selection to include processes on
       other terminals (TTYs) that are owned by you; alternately, this
       may be described as setting the selection to be the set of all
       processes filtered to exclude processes owned by other users or
       not on a terminal.  These effects are not considered when options
       are described as being "identical" below, so <b>-M </b>will be
       considered identical to <b>Z </b>and so on.

       Except as described below, process selection options are
       additive.  The default selection is discarded, and then the
       selected processes are added to the set of processes to be
       displayed.  A process will thus be shown if it meets any of the
       given selection criteria.
