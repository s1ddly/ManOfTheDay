       The <b>nat </b>action allows to perform NAT without the overhead of
       conntrack, which is desirable if the number of flows or addresses
       to perform NAT on is large. This action is best used in
       combination with the <b>u32 </b>filter to allow for efficient lookups of
       a large number of stateless NAT rules in constant time.
