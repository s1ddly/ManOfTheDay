       Incorporates changes from a remote repository into the current
       branch. In its default mode, <b>git pull </b>is shorthand for <b>git fetch</b>
       followed by <b>git merge FETCH_HEAD</b>.

       More precisely, <i>git pull</i> runs <i>git fetch</i> with the given parameters
       and calls <i>git merge</i> to merge the retrieved branch heads into the
       current branch. With <b>--rebase</b>, it runs <i>git rebase</i> instead of <i>git</i>
       <i>merge</i>.

       &lt;repository&gt; should be the name of a remote repository as passed
       to <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/git-fetch.1.html">git-fetch(1)</a>. &lt;refspec&gt; can name an arbitrary remote ref (for
       example, the name of a tag) or even a collection of refs with
       corresponding remote-tracking branches (e.g.,
       refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*), but usually it is the name
       of a branch in the remote repository.

       Default values for &lt;repository&gt; and &lt;branch&gt; are read from the
       "remote" and "merge" configuration for the current branch as set
       by <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/git-branch.1.html">git-branch(1)</a> <b>--track</b>.

       Assume the following history exists and the current branch is
       "<b>master</b>":

                     A---B---C master on origin
                    /
               D---E---F---G master
                   ^
                   origin/master in your repository

       Then "<b>git pull</b>" will fetch and replay the changes from the remote
       <b>master </b>branch since it diverged from the local <b>master </b>(i.e., <b>E</b>)
       until its current commit (<b>C</b>) on top of <b>master </b>and record the
       result in a new commit along with the names of the two parent
       commits and a log message from the user describing the changes.

                     A---B---C origin/master
                    /         \
               D---E---F---G---H master

       See <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/git-merge.1.html">git-merge(1)</a> for details, including how conflicts are
       presented and handled.

       In Git 1.7.0 or later, to cancel a conflicting merge, use <b>git</b>
       <b>reset --merge</b>. <b>Warning</b>: In older versions of Git, running <i>git</i>
       <i>pull</i> with uncommitted changes is discouraged: while possible, it
       leaves you in a state that may be hard to back out of in the case
       of a conflict.

       If any of the remote changes overlap with local uncommitted
       changes, the merge will be automatically canceled and the work
       tree untouched. It is generally best to get any local changes in
       working order before pulling or stash them away with
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/git-stash.1.html">git-stash(1)</a>.
