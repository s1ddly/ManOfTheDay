       A daemon that manages and controls any number of Open vSwitch
       switches on the local machine.

       The <i>database</i> argument specifies how <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>connects to
       <b>ovsdb-server</b>.  <i>database</i> may be an OVSDB active or passive
       connection method, as described in <b>ovsdb</b>(7).  The default is
       <b>unix:/usr/local/var/run/openvswitch/db.sock</b>.

       <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>retrieves its configuration from <i>database</i> at
       startup.  It sets up Open vSwitch datapaths and then operates
       switching across each bridge described in its configuration
       files.  As the database changes, <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>automatically
       updates its configuration to match.

       <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>switches may be configured with any of the following
       features:

       •      L2 switching with MAC learning.

       •      NIC bonding with automatic fail-over and source MAC-based
              TX load balancing ("SLB").

       •      802.1Q VLAN support.

       •      Port mirroring, with optional VLAN tagging.

       •      NetFlow v5 flow logging.

       •      sFlow(R) monitoring.

       •      Connectivity to an external OpenFlow controller, such as
              NOX.

       Only a single instance of <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>is intended to run at a
       time.  A single <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>can manage any number of switch
       instances, up to the maximum number of supported Open vSwitch
       datapaths.

       <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>does all the necessary management of Open vSwitch
       datapaths itself.  Thus, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ovs-dpctl.8.html">ovs-dpctl(8)</a> (and its userspace datapath
       counterparts accessible via <b>ovs-appctl dpctl/</b><i>command</i>) are not
       needed with <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>and should not be used because they can
       interfere with its operation.  These tools are still useful for
       diagnostics.

       An Open vSwitch datapath kernel module must be loaded for
       <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>to be useful.  Refer to the documentation for
       instructions on how to build and load the Open vSwitch kernel
       module.
