       <b>pmtime </b>is a graphical user interface for performance monitoring
       applications using the PCP infrastructure and requiring
       interactive time control.

       <b>pmtime </b>is not normally invoked directly by users.  Rather, it is
       more typical for it to be started by client applications (e.g.
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmchart.1.html">pmchart(1)</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmstat.1.html">pmstat(1)</a> or <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmval.1.html">pmval(1)</a>).

       There are two modes of interacting with a <b>pmtime </b>process - live
       host mode, and historical archive mode.  In archive mode the
       window presents time controls suitable for manipulating the
       archive position, allowing full VCR control to move forwards and
       backwards in time at configurable rates and intervals.  In live
       mode the <b>pmtime </b>window contains the simpler time controls
       suitable for live monitoring.

       Note that the <b>pmtime </b>window is only made visible when explicitly
       requested.  Multiple client applications can be connected to a
       single <b>pmtime </b>server - when the final client application exits,
       <b>pmtime </b>will also exit.
