       <b>ganglia2pcp </b>is intended to read a set of ganglia files stored in
       the rrd format and translate them into a Performance Co-Pilot
       (PCP) archive with the basename <i>outfile</i>.

       The intent of this converter is to take all of the rrd files
       found in the input_dir and generate a single pcp archive file.
       The mapping of ganglia metrics to pcp metrics is defined
       internally.

       The resultant PCP achive may be used with all the PCP client
       tools to graph subsets of the data using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmchart.1.html">pmchart(1)</a>, perform data
       reduction and reporting, filter with the PCP inference engine
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmie.1.html">pmie(1)</a>, etc.

       A series of physical files will be created with the prefix
       <i>outfile</i>.  These are <i>outfile</i><b>.0 </b>(the performance data),
       <i>outfile</i><b>.meta </b>(the metadata that describes the performance data)
       and <i>outfile</i><b>.index </b>(a temporal index to improve efficiency of
       replay operations for the archive).  If any of these files exists
       already, then <b>sar2pcp </b>will <b>not </b>overwrite them and will exit with
       an error message of the form

       __pmLogNewFile: ``blah.0'' already exists, not over-written

       <b>ganglia2pcp </b>is a Perl script that uses the PCP::LogImport Perl
       wrapper around the PCP <i>libpcp_import</i> library, and as such could
       be used as an example to develop new tools to import other types
       of performance data and create PCP archives.  The RRDs Perl
       wrapper is used to parse the raw rrd format files.
