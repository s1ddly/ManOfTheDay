       This manual page documents the GNU version of <b>xargs</b>.  <b>xargs </b>reads
       items from the standard input, delimited by blanks (which can be
       protected with double or single quotes or a backslash) or
       newlines, and executes the <i>command</i> (default is <i>echo</i>) one or more
       times with any <i>initial-arguments</i> followed by items read from
       standard input.  Blank lines on the standard input are ignored.

       The command line for <i>command</i> is built up until it reaches a
       system-defined limit (unless the <b>-n </b>and <b>-L </b>options are used).
       The specified <i>command</i> will be invoked as many times as necessary
       to use up the list of input items.  In general, there will be
       many fewer invocations of <i>command</i> than there were items in the
       input.  This will normally have significant performance benefits.
       Some commands can usefully be executed in parallel too; see the
       <b>-P </b>option.

       Because Unix filenames can contain blanks and newlines, this
       default behaviour is often problematic; filenames containing
       blanks and/or newlines are incorrectly processed by <b>xargs</b>.  In
       these situations it is better to use the <b>-0 </b>option, which
       prevents such problems.   When using this option you will need to
       ensure that the program which produces the input for <b>xargs </b>also
       uses a null character as a separator.  If that program is GNU
       <b>find </b>for example, the <b>-print0 </b>option does this for you.

       If any invocation of the command exits with a status of 255,
       <b>xargs </b>will stop immediately without reading any further input.
       An error message is issued on stderr when this happens.
