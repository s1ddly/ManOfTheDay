       <b>lxc-execute </b>runs the specified <i>command</i> inside the container
       specified by <i>name</i>.

       It will setup the container according to the configuration
       previously defined with the lxc-create command or with the
       configuration file parameter.  If no configuration is defined,
       the default isolation is used.

       This command is mainly used when you want to quickly launch an
       application in an isolated environment.

       <b>lxc-execute </b>command will run the specified command into the
       container via an intermediate process, <b>lxc-init</b>.  This lxc-init
       after launching the specified command, will wait for its end and
       all other reparented processes.  (to support daemons in the
       container).  In other words, in the container, <b>lxc-init </b>has the
       pid 1 and the first process of the application has the pid 2.

       The above <b>lxc-init </b>is designed to forward received signals to the
       started command.
