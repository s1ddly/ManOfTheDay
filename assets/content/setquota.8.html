       <b>setquota </b>is a command line quota editor.  The filesystem,
       user/group/project name and new quotas for this filesystem can be
       specified on the command line. Note that if a number is given in
       the place of a user/group/project name it is treated as an
       UID/GID/project ID.

       <b>-r, --remote</b>
              Edit also remote quota use rpc.rquotad on remote server to
              set quota. This option is available only if quota tools
              were compiled with enabled support for setting quotas over
              RPC.

       <b>-m, --no-mixed-pathnames</b>
              Currently, pathnames of NFSv4 mountpoints are sent without
              leading slash in the path.  <b>rpc.rquotad </b>uses this to
              recognize NFSv4 mounts and properly prepend pseudoroot of
              NFS filesystem to the path. If you specify this option,
              <b>setquota </b>will always send paths with a leading slash. This
              can be useful for legacy reasons but be aware that quota
              over RPC will stop working if you are using new
              <b>rpc.rquotad</b>.

       <b>-F, --format=</b><i>quotaformat</i>
              Perform setting for specified format (ie. don't perform
              format autodetection).  Possible format names are: <b>vfsold</b>
              Original quota format with 16-bit UIDs / GIDs, <b>vfsv0 </b>Quota
              format with 32-bit UIDs / GIDs, 64-bit space usage, 32-bit
              inode usage and limits, <b>vfsv1 </b>Quota format with 64-bit
              quota limits and usage, <b>rpc </b>(quota over NFS), <b>xfs </b>(quota
              on XFS filesystem)

       <b>-u, --user</b>
              Set user quotas for named user. This is the default.

       <b>-g, --group</b>
              Set group quotas for named group.

       <b>-P, --project</b>
              Set project quotas for named project.

       <b>-p, --prototype=</b><i>protoname</i>
              Use quota settings of user, group or project <i>protoname</i> to
              set the quota for the named user, group or project.

       <b>--always-resolve</b>
              Always try to translate user / group / project name to uid
              / gid / project ID even if the name is composed of digits
              only.

       <b>-b, --batch</b>
              Read information to set from stdin (input format is <i>name</i>
              <i>block-softlimit block-hardlimit inode-softlimit inode-</i>
              <i>hardlimit</i> ). Empty lines and lines starting with # are
              ignored.

       <b>-c, --continue-batch</b>
              If parsing of an input line in batch mode fails, continue
              with processing the next line.

       <b>-t, --edit-period</b>
              Set grace times for users/groups/projects. Times <b>block-</b>
              <b>grace </b>and <b>inode-grace </b>are specified in seconds.

       <b>-T, --edit-times</b>
              Alter times for individual user/group/project when
              softlimit is enforced. Times <b>block-grace </b>and <b>inode-grace</b>
              are specified in seconds or can be string 'unset'.

       <b>-a, --all</b>
              Go through all filesystems with quota in <b>/etc/mtab </b>and
              perform setting.

       <i>block-softlimit</i> and <i>block-hardlimit</i> are interpreted as multiples
       of kibibyte (1024 bytes) blocks by default.  Symbols K, M, G, and
       T can be appended to numeric value to express kibibytes,
       mebibytes, gibibytes, and tebibytes.

       <i>inode-softlimit</i> and <i>inode-hardlimit</i> are interpreted literally.
       Symbols k, m, g, and t can be appended to numeric value to
       express multiples of 10^3, 10^6, 10^9, and 10^12 inodes.

       To disable a quota, set the corresponding parameter to 0. To
       change quotas for several filesystems, invoke once for each
       filesystem.

       Only the super-user may edit quotas.
