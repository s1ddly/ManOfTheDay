       Overrides the application specified runtime requirements. This
       can be used to grant a sandboxed application more or less
       resources than it requested.

       By default the application gets access to the resources it
       requested when it is started. But the user can override it on a
       particular instance by specifying extra arguments to flatpak run,
       or every time by using flatpak override.

       If the application id is not specified then the overrides affect
       all applications, but the per-application overrides can override
       the global overrides.

       Unless overridden with the <b>--user </b>or <b>--installation </b>options, this
       command changes the default system-wide installation.
