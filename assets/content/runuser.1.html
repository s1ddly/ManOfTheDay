       <b>runuser </b>can be used to run commands with a substitute user and
       group ID. If the option <b>-u </b>is not given, <b>runuser </b>falls back to
       <b>su</b>-compatible semantics and a shell is executed. The difference
       between the commands <b>runuser </b>and <b>su </b>is that <b>runuser </b>does not ask
       for a password (because it may be executed by the root user only)
       and it uses a different PAM configuration. The command <b>runuser</b>
       does not have to be installed with set-user-ID permissions.

       If the PAM session is not required, then the recommended solution
       is to use the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/setpriv.1.html">setpriv(1)</a> command.

       When called without arguments, <b>runuser </b>defaults to running an
       interactive shell as <i>root</i>.

       For backward compatibility, <b>runuser </b>defaults to not changing the
       current directory and to setting only the environment variables
       <b>HOME </b>and <b>SHELL </b>(plus <b>USER </b>and <b>LOGNAME </b>if the target <i>user</i> is not
       root). This version of <b>runuser </b>uses PAM for session management.

       Note that <b>runuser </b>in all cases use PAM (pam_getenvlist()) to do
       the final environment modification. Command-line options such as
       <b>--login </b>and <b>--preserve-environment </b>affect the environment before
       it is modified by PAM.
