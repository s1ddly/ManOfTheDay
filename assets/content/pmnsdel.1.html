       <b>pmnsdel </b>removes subtrees of names from a Performance Metrics Name
       Space (PMNS), as used by the components of the Performance Co-
       Pilot (PCP).

       Normally <b>pmnsdel </b>operates on the default Performance Metrics Name
       Space (PMNS), however if the <b>-n </b>option is specified an
       alternative namespace is used from the file <i>namespace</i>.

       The default PMNS is found in the file <i>$PCP_VAR_DIR/pmns/root</i>
       unless the environment variable <b>PMNS_DEFAULT </b>is set, in which
       case the value is assumed to be the pathname to the file
       containing the default PMNS.

       The metric names to be deleted are all those for which one of the
       <i>metricpath</i> arguments is a prefix in the PMNS, see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/PMNS.5.html">PMNS(5)</a>.

       All of the files defining the PMNS must be located within the
       directory that contains the root of the PMNS, and this would
       typically be <b>$PCP_VAR_DIR/pmns </b>for the default PMNS, and this
       would typically imply running <b>pmnsdel </b>as root.

       Provided some initial integrity checks are satisfied, <b>pmnsdel</b>
       will update the necessary PMNS files.  Should an error be
       encountered the original namespace is restored.  Note that any
       PMNS files that are no longer referenced by the modified
       namespace will not be removed, even though their contents are not
       part of the new namespace.
