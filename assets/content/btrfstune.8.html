       <b>btrfstune </b>can be used to enable, disable, or set various
       filesystem parameters. The filesystem must be unmounted.

       The common usecase is to enable features that were not enabled at
       mkfs time. Please make sure that you have kernel support for the
       features. You can find a complete list of features and kernel
       version of their introduction at
       <b>https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Changelog#By_feature </b><b></b>.
       Also, the manual page <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/mkfs.btrfs.8.html">mkfs.btrfs(8)</a> contains more details about
       the features.

       Some of the features could be also enabled on a mounted
       filesystem by other means. Please refer to the <i>FILESYSTEM</i>
       <i>FEATURES</i> in <b>btrfs</b>(5).
