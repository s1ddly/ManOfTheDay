       <b>ipptool </b>sends IPP requests to the specified <i>printer-uri</i> and tests
       and/or displays the results.  Each named <i>testfile</i> defines one or
       more requests, including the expected response status,
       attributes, and values.  Output is either a plain text, formatted
       text, CSV, or XML report on the standard output, with a non-zero
       exit status indicating that one or more tests have failed.  The
       <i>testfile</i> format is described in <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/ipptoolfile.5.html">ipptoolfile(5)</a>.
