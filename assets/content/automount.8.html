       The <b>automount </b>program is used to manage mount points for autofs,
       the inlined Linux automounter.  <b>automount </b>works by reading the
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/auto.master.5.html">auto.master(5)</a> map and sets up mount points for each entry in the
       master map allowing them to be automatically mounted when
       accessed. The file systems are then automatically umounted after
       a period of inactivity.
