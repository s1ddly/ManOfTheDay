       Linux implements the AppleTalk protocols described in <i>Inside</i>
       <i>AppleTalk</i>.  Only the DDP layer and AARP are present in the
       kernel.  They are designed to be used via the <b>netatalk </b>protocol
       libraries.  This page documents the interface for those who wish
       or need to use the DDP layer directly.

       The communication between AppleTalk and the user program works
       using a BSD-compatible socket interface.  For more information on
       sockets, see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/socket.7.html">socket(7)</a>.

       An AppleTalk socket is created by calling the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/socket.2.html">socket(2)</a> function
       with a <b>AF_APPLETALK </b>socket family argument.  Valid socket types
       are <b>SOCK_DGRAM </b>to open a <b>ddp </b>socket or <b>SOCK_RAW </b>to open a <b>raw</b>
       socket.  <i>protocol</i> is the AppleTalk protocol to be received or
       sent.  For <b>SOCK_RAW </b>you must specify <b>ATPROTO_DDP</b>.

       Raw sockets may be opened only by a process with effective user
       ID 0 or when the process has the <b>CAP_NET_RAW </b>capability.

   <b>Address format</b>
       An AppleTalk socket address is defined as a combination of a
       network number, a node number, and a port number.

           struct at_addr {
               unsigned short s_net;
               unsigned char  s_node;
           };

           struct sockaddr_atalk {
               sa_family_t    sat_family;    /* address family */
               unsigned char  sat_port;      /* port */
               struct at_addr sat_addr;      /* net/node */
           };

       <i>sat_family</i> is always set to <b>AF_APPLETALK</b>.  <i>sat_port</i> contains the
       port.  The port numbers below 129 are known as <i>reserved ports</i>.
       Only processes with the effective user ID 0 or the
       <b>CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE </b>capability may <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/bind.2.html">bind(2)</a> to these sockets.
       <i>sat_addr</i> is the host address.  The <i>net</i> member of <i>struct at_addr</i>
       contains the host network in network byte order.  The value of
       <b>AT_ANYNET </b>is a wildcard and also implies “this network.”  The
       <i>node</i> member of <i>struct at_addr</i> contains the host node number.  The
       value of <b>AT_ANYNODE </b>is a wildcard and also implies “this node.”
       The value of <b>ATADDR_BCAST </b>is a link local broadcast address.

   <b>Socket options</b>
       No protocol-specific socket options are supported.

   <b>/proc interfaces</b>
       IP supports a set of <i>/proc</i> interfaces to configure some global
       AppleTalk parameters.  The parameters can be accessed by reading
       or writing files in the directory <i>/proc/sys/net/atalk/</i>.

       <i>aarp-expiry-time</i>
              The time interval (in seconds) before an AARP cache entry
              expires.

       <i>aarp-resolve-time</i>
              The time interval (in seconds) before an AARP cache entry
              is resolved.

       <i>aarp-retransmit-limit</i>
              The number of retransmissions of an AARP query before the
              node is declared dead.

       <i>aarp-tick-time</i>
              The timer rate (in seconds) for the timer driving AARP.

       The default values match the specification and should never need
       to be changed.

   <b>Ioctls</b>
       All ioctls described in <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/socket.7.html">socket(7)</a> apply to DDP.
