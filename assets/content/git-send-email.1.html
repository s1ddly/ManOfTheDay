       Takes the patches given on the command line and emails them out.
       Patches can be specified as files, directories (which will send
       all files in the directory), or directly as a revision list. In
       the last case, any format accepted by <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/git-format-patch.1.html">git-format-patch(1)</a> can be
       passed to git send-email.

       The header of the email is configurable via command-line options.
       If not specified on the command line, the user will be prompted
       with a ReadLine enabled interface to provide the necessary
       information.

       There are two formats accepted for patch files:

        1. mbox format files

           This is what <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/git-format-patch.1.html">git-format-patch(1)</a> generates. Most headers and
           MIME formatting are ignored.

        2. The original format used by Greg Kroah-Hartmanâ€™s
           <i>send_lots_of_email.pl</i> script

           This format expects the first line of the file to contain the
           "Cc:" value and the "Subject:" of the message as the second
           line.
