       This command reads the input file and displays the trace
       recorded.

       There are several variants of perf script:

           'perf script' to see a detailed trace of the workload that was
           recorded.

           You can also run a set of pre-canned scripts that aggregate and
           summarize the raw trace data in various ways (the list of scripts is
           available via 'perf script -l').  The following variants allow you to
           record and run those scripts:

           'perf script record &lt;script&gt; &lt;command&gt;' to record the events required
           for 'perf script report'.  &lt;script&gt; is the name displayed in the
           output of 'perf script --list' i.e. the actual script name minus any
           language extension.  If &lt;command&gt; is not specified, the events are
           recorded using the -a (system-wide) 'perf record' option.

           'perf script report &lt;script&gt; [args]' to run and display the results
           of &lt;script&gt;.  &lt;script&gt; is the name displayed in the output of 'perf
           script --list' i.e. the actual script name minus any language
           extension.  The perf.data output from a previous run of 'perf script
           record &lt;script&gt;' is used and should be present for this command to
           succeed.  [args] refers to the (mainly optional) args expected by
           the script.

           'perf script &lt;script&gt; &lt;required-script-args&gt; &lt;command&gt;' to both
           record the events required for &lt;script&gt; and to run the &lt;script&gt;
           using 'live-mode' i.e. without writing anything to disk.  &lt;script&gt;
           is the name displayed in the output of 'perf script --list' i.e. the
           actual script name minus any language extension.  If &lt;command&gt; is
           not specified, the events are recorded using the -a (system-wide)
           'perf record' option.  If &lt;script&gt; has any required args, they
           should be specified before &lt;command&gt;.  This mode doesn't allow for
           optional script args to be specified; if optional script args are
           desired, they can be specified using separate 'perf script record'
           and 'perf script report' commands, with the stdout of the record step
           piped to the stdin of the report script, using the '-o -' and '-i -'
           options of the corresponding commands.

           'perf script &lt;top-script&gt;' to both record the events required for
           &lt;top-script&gt; and to run the &lt;top-script&gt; using 'live-mode'
           i.e. without writing anything to disk.  &lt;top-script&gt; is the name
           displayed in the output of 'perf script --list' i.e. the actual
           script name minus any language extension; a &lt;top-script&gt; is defined
           as any script name ending with the string 'top'.

           [&lt;record-options&gt;] can be passed to the record steps of 'perf script
           record' and 'live-mode' variants; this isn't possible however for
           &lt;top-script&gt; 'live-mode' or 'perf script report' variants.

           information on how to write and run your own trace scripts.
