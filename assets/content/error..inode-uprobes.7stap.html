       The uprobes kernel facility introduced in Linux 3.5 aims to
       supplant the earlier out-of-tree utrace patch to enable user-
       space probing.  There have been some functional limitations in
       inode-uprobes that preclude some systemtap constructs.  Over
       time, we hope these regressions will be corrected.

       function.return probes
              <i>process.function().return</i> probes require "return-probes"
              or "uretprobes" functionality, which was not implemented
              in the builtin inode-uprobes until kernel 3.10.  If you
              cannot upgrade your kernel, consider using
              <i>process.statement()</i> probes placed on source line numbers
              at the function's return statements.

       function.statement.absolute probes
              In utrace-equipped kernels, systemtap made it possible to
              address probes by literal addresses in the process virtual
              memory address space.  The new inode-uprobes does not have
              this capability.
