       The <i>stty</i> utility shall set or report on terminal I/O
       characteristics for the device that is its standard input.
       Without options or operands specified, it shall report the
       settings of certain characteristics, usually those that differ
       from implementation-defined defaults.  Otherwise, it shall modify
       the terminal state according to the specified operands. Detailed
       information about the modes listed in the first five groups below
       are described in the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017,
       <i>Chapter 11</i>, <i>General Terminal Interface</i>.  Operands in the
       Combination Modes group (see <i>Combination Modes</i>) are implemented
       using operands in the previous groups. Some combinations of
       operands are mutually-exclusive on some terminal types; the
       results of using such combinations are unspecified.

       Typical implementations of this utility require a communications
       line configured to use the <b>termios </b>interface defined in the
       System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017. On systems where none
       of these lines are available, and on lines not currently
       configured to support the <b>termios </b>interface, some of the operands
       need not affect terminal characteristics.
