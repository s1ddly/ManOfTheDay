       <b>dh_gencontrol </b>is a debhelper program that is responsible for
       generating control files, and installing them into the <i>DEBIAN</i>
       directory with the proper permissions.

       This program is merely a wrapper around <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dpkg-gencontrol.1.html">dpkg-gencontrol(1)</a>, which
       calls it once for each package being acted on (plus related
       dbgsym packages), and passes in some additional useful flags.

       <b>Note </b>that if you use <b>dh_gencontrol</b>, you must also use
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dh_builddeb.1.html">dh_builddeb(1)</a> to build the packages.  Otherwise, your build may
       fail to build as <b>dh_gencontrol </b>(via <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dpkg-gencontrol.1.html">dpkg-gencontrol(1)</a>) declares
       which packages are built.  As debhelper automatically generates
       dbgsym packages, it some times adds additional packages, which
       will be built by <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dh_builddeb.1.html">dh_builddeb(1)</a>.
