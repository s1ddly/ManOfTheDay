<pre>
       The <i>c99</i> utility is an interface to the standard C compilation
       system; it shall accept source code conforming to the ISO C
       standard. The system conceptually consists of a compiler and link
       editor. The input files referenced by <i>pathname</i> operands and <b>-l</b>
       option-arguments shall be compiled and linked to produce an
       executable file. (It is unspecified whether the linking occurs
       entirely within the operation of <i>c99</i>; some implementations may
       produce objects that are not fully resolved until the file is
       executed.)

       If the <b>-c </b>option is specified, for all pathname operands of the
       form <i>file</i><b>.c</b>, the files:

           $(basename <i>pathname</i> .c).o

       shall be created as the result of successful compilation. If the
       <b>-c </b>option is not specified, it is unspecified whether such <b>.o</b>
       files are created or deleted for the <i>file</i><b>.c </b>operands.

       If there are no options that prevent link editing (such as <b>-c </b>or
       <b>-E</b>), and all input files compile and link without error, the
       resulting executable file shall be written according to the <b>-o</b>
       <i>outfile</i> option (if present) or to the file <b>a.out</b>.

       The executable file shall be created as specified in <i>Section</i>
       <i>1.1.1.4</i>, <i>File Read</i>, <i>Write</i>, <i>and Creation</i>, except that the file
       permission bits shall be set to: S_IRWXO | S_IRWXG | S_IRWXU

       and the bits specified by the <i>umask</i> of the process shall be
       cleared.
