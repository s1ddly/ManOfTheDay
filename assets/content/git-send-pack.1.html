       Usually you would want to use <i>git push</i>, which is a higher-level
       wrapper of this command, instead. See <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/git-push.1.html">git-push(1)</a>.

       Invokes <i>git-receive-pack</i> on a possibly remote repository, and
       updates it from the current repository, sending named refs.
