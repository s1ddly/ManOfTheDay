       Cryptsetup-reencrypt can be used to change reencryption
       parameters which otherwise require full on-disk data change (re-
       encryption).

       You can regenerate <b>volume key </b>(the real key used in on-disk
       encryption unclocked by passphrase), <b>cipher</b>, <b>cipher mode</b>.

       Cryptsetup-reencrypt reencrypts data on LUKS device in-place.
       During reencryption process the LUKS device is marked
       unavailable.

       <i>NOTE</i>: If you're looking for LUKS2 online reencryption manual
       please read cryptsetup(8) man page instead (see reencrypt
       action). This page is for legacy offline reencryption utility
       only.

       <i>WARNING</i>: The cryptsetup-reencrypt program is not resistant to
       hardware or kernel failures during reencryption (you can lose
       your data in this case).

       <i>ALWAYS BE SURE YOU HAVE RELIABLE BACKUP BEFORE USING THIS TOOL.</i>
       The reencryption can be temporarily suspended (by TERM signal or
       by using ctrl+c) but you need to retain temporary files named
       LUKS-&lt;uuid&gt;.[log|org|new].  LUKS device is unavailable until
       reencryption is finished though.

       Current working directory must be writable and temporary files
       created during reencryption must be present.

       For more info about LUKS see cryptsetup(8).
