     <b>rpc.idmapd </b>is the NFSv4 ID &lt;-&gt; name mapping daemon.  It provides
     functionality to the NFSv4 kernel client and server, to which it
     communicates via upcalls, by translating user and group IDs to
     names, and vice versa.

     The system derives the part of the string by performing a password
     or group lookup.  The lookup mechanism is configured in
     <i>/etc/idmapd.conf</i>

     By default, the part of the string is the system's DNS domain name.
     It can also be specified in <i>/etc/idmapd.conf</i> if the system is
     multi-homed, or if the system's DNS domain name does not match the
     name of the system's Kerberos realm.

     When the domain is not specified in /etc/idmapd.conf the local DNS
     server will be queried for the <b>_nfsv4idmapdomain </b>text record. If
     the record exists that will be used as the domain. When the record
     does not exist, the domain part of the DNS domain will used.

     Note that on more recent kernels only the NFSv4 server uses
     <b>rpc.idmapd</b>.  The NFSv4 client instead uses nfsidmap(8), and only
     falls back to <b>rpc.idmapd </b>if there was a problem running the
     nfsidmap(8) program.

     The options are as follows:

     <b>-h           </b>Display usage message.

     <b>-v           </b>Increases the verbosity level (can be specified
                  multiple times).

     <b>-f           </b>Runs <b>rpc.idmapd </b>in the foreground and prints all
                  output to the terminal.

     <b>-p </b><i>path</i>      Specifies the location of the RPC pipefs to be <i>path</i>.
                  The default value is "/var/lib/nfs/rpc_pipefs".

     <b>-c </b><i>path</i>      Use configuration file <i>path</i>.  This option is
                  deprecated.

     <b>-C           </b>Client-only: perform no idmapping for any NFS server,
                  even if one is detected.

     <b>-S           </b>Server-only: perform no idmapping for any NFS client,
                  even if one is detected.
