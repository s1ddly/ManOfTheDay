       netsniff-ng is a fast, minimal tool to analyze network packets,
       capture pcap files, replay pcap files, and redirect traffic
       between interfaces with the help of zero-copy packet(7) sockets.
       netsniff-ng uses both Linux specific RX_RING and TX_RING
       interfaces to perform zero-copy. This is to avoid copy and system
       call overhead between kernel and user address space. When we
       started working on netsniff-ng, the pcap(3) library did not use
       this zero-copy facility.

       netsniff-ng is Linux specific, meaning there is no support for
       other operating systems. Therefore we can keep the code footprint
       quite minimal and to the point. Linux packet(7) sockets and its
       RX_RING and TX_RING interfaces bypass the normal packet
       processing path through the networking stack.  This is the
       fastest capturing or transmission performance one can get from
       user space out of the box, without having to load unsupported or
       non-mainline third-party kernel modules. We explicitly refuse to
       build netsniff-ng on top of ntop/PF_RING. Not because we do not
       like it (we do find it interesting), but because of the fact that
       it is not part of the mainline kernel. Therefore, the ntop
       project has to maintain and sync out-of-tree drivers to adapt
       them to their DNA. Eventually, we went for untainted Linux
       kernel, since its code has a higher rate of review, maintenance,
       security and bug fixes.

       netsniff-ng also supports early packet filtering in the kernel.
       It has support for low-level and high-level packet filters that
       are translated into Berkeley Packet Filter instructions.

       netsniff-ng can capture pcap files in several different pcap
       formats that are interoperable with other tools. The following
       pcap I/O methods are supported for efficient to-disc capturing:
       scatter-gather, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html">mmap(2)</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/read.2.html">read(2)</a>, and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/write.2.html">write(2)</a>.  netsniff-ng is
       also able to rotate pcap files based on data size or time
       intervals, thus, making it a useful backend tool for subsequent
       traffic analysis.

       netsniff-ng itself also supports analysis, replaying, and dumping
       of raw 802.11 frames. For online or offline analysis, netsniff-ng
       has a built-in packet dissector for the current 802.3 (Ethernet),
       802.11* (WLAN), ARP, MPLS, 802.1Q (VLAN), 802.1QinQ, LLDP, IPv4,
       IPv6, ICMPv4, ICMPv6, IGMP, TCP and UDP, including GeoIP location
       analysis. Since netsniff-ng does not establish any state or
       perform reassembly during packet dissection, its memory footprint
       is quite low, thus, making netsniff-ng quite efficient for
       offline analysis of large pcap files as well.

       Note that netsniff-ng is currently not multithreaded. However,
       this does not prevent you from starting multiple netsniff-ng
       instances that are pinned to different, non-overlapping CPUs and
       f.e. have different BPF filters attached.  Likely that at some
       point in time your harddisc might become a bottleneck assuming
       you do not rotate such pcaps in ram (and from there periodically
       scheduled move to slower medias). You can then use <b>mergecap</b>(1) to
       transform all pcap files into a single large pcap file. Thus,
       netsniff-ng then works multithreaded eventually.

       netsniff-ng can also be used to debug netlink traffic.
