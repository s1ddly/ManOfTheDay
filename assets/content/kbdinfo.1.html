       The utility allows you to read and check various parameters of
       the keyboard and virtual console.

       <b>getmode  </b>Get or check virtual console mode.

       <b>gkbmode  </b>Gets current keyboard mode.

              <b>raw    </b>Raw (scancode) mode. These are the raw codes
                     generated by the keyboard.

              <b>mediumraw</b>
                     Medium raw (scancode) mode. This is extended medium
                     raw mode, with keys above 127 encoded as 0, high 7
                     bits, low 7 bits, with the 0 bearing the 'up' flag
                     if needed. 0 is reserved, so this shouldn't
                     interfere with anything else. The two bytes after 0
                     will always have the up flag set not to interfere
                     with older applications. This allows for 16384
                     different keycodes, which should be enough.

              <b>xlate  </b>Translate keycodes using keymap. These are the
                     codes generated via the current keysym mapping.

              <b>unicode</b>
                     Unicode mode.

       <b>gkbmeta  </b>Gets meta key handling mode.

              <b>escprefix</b>
                     Specifies if pressing the meta (alt) key generates
                     an ESC (\033) prefix followed by the keysym.

              <b>metabit</b>
                     The keysym marked with the high bit set.

       <b>gkbled   </b>Get keyboard flags CapsLock, NumLock, ScrollLock (not
                lights).

              <b>scrolllock</b>
                     The scroll lock is down.

              <b>numlock</b>
                     The num lock is down.

              <b>capslock</b>
                     The caps lock is down.
