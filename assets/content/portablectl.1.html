       <b>portablectl </b>may be used to attach, detach or inspect portable
       service images. It's primarily a command interfacing with
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/systemd-portabled.service.8.html">systemd-portabled.service(8)</a>.

       Portable service images contain an OS file system tree along with
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/systemd.1.html">systemd(1)</a> unit file information. A service image may be
       "attached" to the local system. If attached, a set of unit files
       are copied from the image to the host, and extended with
       <i>RootDirectory=</i> or <i>RootImage=</i> assignments (in case of service
       units) pointing to the image file or directory, ensuring the
       services will run within the file system context of the image.

       Portable service images are an efficient way to bundle multiple
       related services and other units together, and transfer them as a
       whole between systems. When these images are attached the local
       system the contained units may run in most ways like regular
       system-provided units, either with full privileges or inside
       strict sandboxing, depending on the selected configuration.

       Specifically portable service images may be of the following
       kind:

       •   Directory trees containing an OS, including the top-level
           directories /usr/, /etc/, and so on.

       •   btrfs subvolumes containing OS trees, similar to normal
           directory trees.

       •   Binary "raw" disk images containing MBR or GPT partition
           tables and Linux file system partitions. (These must be
           regular files, with the .raw suffix.)
