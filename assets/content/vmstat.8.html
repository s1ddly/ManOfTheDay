       <b>vmstat </b>reports information about processes, memory, paging, block
       IO, traps, disks and cpu activity.

       The first report produced gives averages since the last reboot.
       Additional reports give information on a sampling period of
       length <i>delay</i>.  The process and memory reports are instantaneous
       in either case.
