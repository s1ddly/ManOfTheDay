       <b>ebtables </b>is an application program used to set up and maintain
       the tables of rules (inside the Linux kernel) that inspect
       Ethernet frames.  It is analogous to the <b>iptables </b>application,
       but less complicated, due to the fact that the Ethernet protocol
       is much simpler than the IP protocol.

   <b>CHAINS</b>
       There are two ebtables tables with built-in chains in the Linux
       kernel. These tables are used to divide functionality into
       different sets of rules. Each set of rules is called a chain.
       Each chain is an ordered list of rules that can match Ethernet
       frames. If a rule matches an Ethernet frame, then a processing
       specification tells what to do with that matching frame. The
       processing specification is called a 'target'. However, if the
       frame does not match the current rule in the chain, then the next
       rule in the chain is examined and so forth.  The user can create
       new (user-defined) chains that can be used as the 'target' of a
       rule. User-defined chains are very useful to get better
       performance over the linear traversal of the rules and are also
       essential for structuring the filtering rules into well-organized
       and maintainable sets of rules.

   <b>TARGETS</b>
       A firewall rule specifies criteria for an Ethernet frame and a
       frame processing specification called a target.  When a frame
       matches a rule, then the next action performed by the kernel is
       specified by the target.  The target can be one of these values:
       <b>ACCEPT</b>, <b>DROP</b>, <b>CONTINUE</b>, <b>RETURN</b>, an 'extension' (see below) or a
       jump to a user-defined chain.

       <b>ACCEPT </b>means to let the frame through.  <b>DROP </b>means the frame has
       to be dropped.  <b>CONTINUE </b>means the next rule has to be checked.
       This can be handy, f.e., to know how many frames pass a certain
       point in the chain, to log those frames or to apply multiple
       targets on a frame.  <b>RETURN </b>means stop traversing this chain and
       resume at the next rule in the previous (calling) chain.  For the
       extension targets please refer to the <b>TARGET EXTENSIONS </b>section
       of this man page.

   <b>TABLES</b>
       As stated earlier, there are two ebtables tables in the Linux
       kernel.  The table names are <b>filter </b>and <b>nat</b>.  Of these two
       tables, the filter table is the default table that the command
       operates on.  If you are working with the filter table, then you
       can drop the '-t filter' argument to the ebtables command.
       However, you will need to provide the -t argument for <b>nat </b>table.
       Moreover, the -t argument must be the first argument on the
       ebtables command line, if used.

       <b>-t, --table</b>
              <b>filter </b>is the default table and contains three built-in
              chains: <b>INPUT </b>(for frames destined for the bridge itself,
              on the level of the MAC destination address), <b>OUTPUT </b>(for
              locally-generated or (b)routed frames) and <b>FORWARD </b>(for
              frames being forwarded by the bridge).
              <b>nat </b>is mostly used to change the mac addresses and
              contains three built-in chains: <b>PREROUTING </b>(for altering
              frames as soon as they come in), <b>OUTPUT </b>(for altering
              locally generated or (b)routed frames before they are
              bridged) and <b>POSTROUTING </b>(for altering frames as they are
              about to go out). A small note on the naming of chains
              PREROUTING and POSTROUTING: it would be more accurate to
              call them PREFORWARDING and POSTFORWARDING, but for all
              those who come from the iptables world to ebtables it is
              easier to have the same names. Note that you can change
              the name (<b>-E</b>) if you don't like the default.
