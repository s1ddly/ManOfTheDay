       <b>autofs </b>controls the operation of the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/automount.8.html">automount(8)</a> daemon(s)
       running on the Linux system. Usually <b>autofs </b>is invoked at system
       boot time with the <i>start</i> parameter and at shutdown time with the
       <i>stop</i> parameter. Service control actions can also be manually
       invoked by the system administrator to shut down, restart, reload
       or obtain service status.
