       <b>dpkg-architecture </b>provides a facility to determine and set the
       build and host architecture for package building.

       The build architecture is always determined by an external call
       to <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dpkg.1.html">dpkg(1)</a>, and cannot be set at the command line.

       You can specify the host architecture by providing one or both of
       the options <b>--host-arch </b>and <b>--host-type</b>. The default is
       determined by an external call to <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/gcc.1.html">gcc(1)</a>, or the same as the
       build architecture if <b>CC </b>or gcc are both not available. One out
       of <b>--host-arch </b>and <b>--host-type </b>is sufficient, the value of the
       other will be set to a usable default. Indeed, it is often better
       to only specify one, because <b>dpkg-architecture </b>will warn you if
       your choice does not match the default.
