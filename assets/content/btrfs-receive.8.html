<pre>
       Receive a stream of changes and replicate one or more subvolumes
       that were previously generated by <b>btrfs send</b>. The received
       subvolumes are stored to <i>path</i>, unless <i>--dump</i> option is given.

       If <i>--dump</i> option is specified, <b>btrfs receive </b>will only do the
       validation of the stream, and print the stream metadata, one
       operation per line.

       <b>btrfs receive </b>will fail in the following cases:

        1. receiving subvolume already exists

        2. previously received subvolume has been changed after it was
           received

        3. default subvolume has changed or you didnâ€™t mount the
           filesystem at the toplevel subvolume

       A subvolume is made read-only after the receiving process
       finishes successfully (see BUGS below).

       <b>Options</b>

       -f <i>&lt;FILE&gt;</i>
           read the stream from <i>&lt;FILE&gt;</i> instead of stdin,

       -C|--chroot
           confine the process to <i>path</i> using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/chroot.1.html">chroot(1)</a>

       -e
           terminate after receiving an <i>end cmd</i> marker in the stream.

           Without this option the receiver side terminates only in case
           of an error on end of file.

       -E|--max-errors <i>&lt;NERR&gt;</i>
           terminate as soon as NERR errors occur while stream
           processing commands from the stream

           Default value is 1. A value of 0 means no limit.

       -m <i>&lt;ROOTMOUNT&gt;</i>
           the root mount point of the destination filesystem

           By default the mountpoint is searched in <i>/proc/self/mounts</i>.
           If <i>/proc</i> is not accessible, eg. in a chroot environment, use
           this option to tell us where this filesystem is mounted.

       --dump
           dump the stream metadata, one line per operation

           Does not require the <i>path</i> parameter. The filesystem remains
           unchanged.

       -q|--quiet
           (deprecated) alias for global <i>-q</i> option

       -v
           (deprecated) alias for global <i>-v</i> option

       <b>Global options</b>

       -v|--verbose
           increase verbosity about performed actions, print details
           about each operation

       -q|--quiet
           suppress all messages except errors
