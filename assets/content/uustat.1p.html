       The <i>uustat</i> utility shall display the status of, or cancel,
       previously specified <i>uucp</i> requests, or provide general status on
       <i>uucp</i> connections to other systems.

       When no options are given, <i>uustat</i> shall write to standard output
       the status of all <i>uucp</i> requests issued by the current user.

       Typical implementations of this utility require a communications
       line configured to use the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‚Äê2017, <i>Chapter 11</i>, <i>General Terminal Interface</i>, but other
       communications means may be used. On systems where there are no
       available communications means (either temporarily or
       permanently), this utility shall write an error message
       describing the problem and exit with a non-zero exit status.
