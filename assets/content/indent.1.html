       This man page is generated from the file <i>indent.texinfo</i>.  This is
       Edition  of "The <b>indent </b>Manual", for Indent Version , last
       updated .

       The <b>indent </b>program can be used to make code easier to read.  It
       can also convert from one style of writing C to another.

       <b>indent </b>understands a substantial amount about the syntax of C,
       but it also attempts to cope with incomplete and misformed
       syntax.

       In version 1.2 and more recent versions, the GNU style of
       indenting is the default.
