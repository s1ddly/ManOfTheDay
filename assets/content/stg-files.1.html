       List the files modified by the given patch (defaulting to the
       current one). Passing the <i>--stat</i> option shows the diff statistics
       for the given patch. Note that this command doesnâ€™t show the
       files modified in the working tree and not yet included in the
       patch by a <i>refresh</i> command. Use the <i>diff</i> or <i>status</i> commands for
       these files.
