       A systemtap compile server listens for connections from stap
       clients on a secure SSL network port and accepts requests to run
       the <i>stap</i> front end. Each server advertises its presence and
       configuration on the local network using mDNS (<i>avahi</i>) allowing
       for automatic detection by clients.

       The stap-server script aims to provide:

       •   management of systemtap compile servers as a service.

       •   convenient control over configured servers and individual
           (ad-hoc) servers.
