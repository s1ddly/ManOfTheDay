<pre>
       The <i>comm</i> utility shall read <i>file1</i> and <i>file2</i>, which should be
       ordered in the current collating sequence, and produce three text
       columns as output: lines only in <i>file1</i>, lines only in <i>file2</i>, and
       lines in both files.

       If the lines in both files are not ordered according to the
       collating sequence of the current locale, the results are
       unspecified.

       If the collating sequence of the current locale does not have a
       total ordering of all characters (see the Base Definitions volume
       of POSIX.1‚Äê2017, <i>Section 7.3.2</i>, <i>LC_COLLATE</i>) and any lines from
       the input files collate equally but are not identical, <i>comm</i>
       should treat them as different lines but may treat them as being
       the same. If it treats them as different, <i>comm</i> should expect them
       to be ordered according to a further byte-by-byte comparison
       using the collating sequence for the POSIX locale and if they are
       not ordered in this way, the output of <i>comm</i> can identify such
       lines as being both unique to <i>file1</i> and unique to <i>file2</i> instead
       of being in both files.
