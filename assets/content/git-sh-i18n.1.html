       This is not a command the end user would want to run. Ever. This
       documentation is meant for people who are studying the
       Porcelain-ish scripts and/or are writing new ones.

       The 'git sh-i18n scriptlet is designed to be sourced (using <b>.</b>) by
       Gitâ€™s porcelain programs implemented in shell script. It provides
       wrappers for the GNU <b>gettext </b>and <b>eval_gettext </b>functions
       accessible through the <b>gettext.sh </b>script, and provides
       pass-through fallbacks on systems without GNU gettext.
