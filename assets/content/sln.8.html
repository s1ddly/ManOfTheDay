       The <b>sln </b>program creates symbolic links.  Unlike the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ln.1.html">ln(1)</a>
       program, it is statically linked.  This means that if for some
       reason the dynamic linker is not working, <b>sln </b>can be used to make
       symbolic links to dynamic libraries.

       The command line has two forms.  In the first form, it creates
       <i>dest</i> as a new symbolic link to <i>source</i>.

       In the second form, <i>filelist</i> is a list of space-separated
       pathname pairs, and the effect is as if <b>sln </b>was executed once for
       each line of the file, with the two pathnames as the arguments.

       The <b>sln </b>program supports no command-line options.
