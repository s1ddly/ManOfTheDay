       <b>dh_prep </b>is a debhelper program that performs some file cleanups
       in preparation for building a binary package. (This is what
       <b>dh_clean -k </b>used to do.) It removes the package build
       directories, <i>debian/tmp</i>, and some temp files that are generated
       when building a binary package.

       It is typically run at the top of the <b>binary-arch </b>and <b>binary-</b>
       <b>indep </b>targets, or at the top of a target such as install that
       they depend on.
