<pre>
     <b>ssh </b>(SSH client) is a program for logging into a remote machine and
     for executing commands on a remote machine.  It is intended to
     provide secure encrypted communications between two untrusted hosts
     over an insecure network.  X11 connections, arbitrary TCP ports and
     UNIX-domain sockets can also be forwarded over the secure channel.

     <b>ssh </b>connects and logs into the specified <i>destination</i>, which may be
     specified as either [user@]hostname or a URI of the form
     ssh://[user@]hostname[:port].  The user must prove their identity
     to the remote machine using one of several methods (see below).

     If a <i>command</i> is specified, it is executed on the remote host
     instead of a login shell.

     The options are as follows:

     <b>-4      </b>Forces <b>ssh </b>to use IPv4 addresses only.

     <b>-6      </b>Forces <b>ssh </b>to use IPv6 addresses only.

     <b>-A      </b>Enables forwarding of connections from an authentication
             agent such as ssh-agent(1).  This can also be specified on
             a per-host basis in a configuration file.

             Agent forwarding should be enabled with caution.  Users
             with the ability to bypass file permissions on the remote
             host (for the agent's UNIX-domain socket) can access the
             local agent through the forwarded connection.  An attacker
             cannot obtain key material from the agent, however they can
             perform operations on the keys that enable them to
             authenticate using the identities loaded into the agent.  A
             safer alternative may be to use a jump host (see <b>-J</b>).

     <b>-a      </b>Disables forwarding of the authentication agent connection.

     <b>-B </b><i>bind_interface</i>
             Bind to the address of <i>bind_interface</i> before attempting to
             connect to the destination host.  This is only useful on
             systems with more than one address.

     <b>-b </b><i>bind_address</i>
             Use <i>bind_address</i> on the local machine as the source address
             of the connection.  Only useful on systems with more than
             one address.

     <b>-C      </b>Requests compression of all data (including stdin, stdout,
             stderr, and data for forwarded X11, TCP and UNIX-domain
             connections).  The compression algorithm is the same used
             by gzip(1).  Compression is desirable on modem lines and
             other slow connections, but will only slow down things on
             fast networks.  The default value can be set on a host-by-
             host basis in the configuration files; see the <b>Compression</b>
             option.

     <b>-c </b><i>cipher_spec</i>
             Selects the cipher specification for encrypting the
             session.  <i>cipher_spec</i> is a comma-separated list of ciphers
             listed in order of preference.  See the <b>Ciphers </b>keyword in
             ssh_config(5) for more information.

     <b>-D </b>[<i>bind_address</i>:]<i>port</i>
             Specifies a local “dynamic” application-level port
             forwarding.  This works by allocating a socket to listen to
             <i>port</i> on the local side, optionally bound to the specified
             <i>bind_address</i>.  Whenever a connection is made to this port,
             the connection is forwarded over the secure channel, and
             the application protocol is then used to determine where to
             connect to from the remote machine.  Currently the SOCKS4
             and SOCKS5 protocols are supported, and <b>ssh </b>will act as a
             SOCKS server.  Only root can forward privileged ports.
             Dynamic port forwardings can also be specified in the
             configuration file.

             IPv6 addresses can be specified by enclosing the address in
             square brackets.  Only the superuser can forward privileged
             ports.  By default, the local port is bound in accordance
             with the <b>GatewayPorts </b>setting.  However, an explicit
             <i>bind_address</i> may be used to bind the connection to a
             specific address.  The <i>bind_address</i> of “localhost”
             indicates that the listening port be bound for local use
             only, while an empty address or ‘*’ indicates that the port
             should be available from all interfaces.

     <b>-E </b><i>log_file</i>
             Append debug logs to <i>log_file</i> instead of standard error.

     <b>-e </b><i>escape_char</i>
             Sets the escape character for sessions with a pty (default:
             ‘~’).  The escape character is only recognized at the
             beginning of a line.  The escape character followed by a
             dot (‘.’) closes the connection; followed by control-Z
             suspends the connection; and followed by itself sends the
             escape character once.  Setting the character to “none”
             disables any escapes and makes the session fully
             transparent.

     <b>-F </b><i>configfile</i>
             Specifies an alternative per-user configuration file.  If a
             configuration file is given on the command line, the
             system-wide configuration file (<i>/etc/ssh/ssh_config</i>) will
             be ignored.  The default for the per-user configuration
             file is <i>~/.ssh/config</i>.  If set to “none”, no configuration
             files will be read.

     <b>-f      </b>Requests <b>ssh </b>to go to background just before command
             execution.  This is useful if <b>ssh </b>is going to ask for
             passwords or passphrases, but the user wants it in the
             background.  This implies <b>-n</b>.  The recommended way to start
             X11 programs at a remote site is with something like <b>ssh -f</b>
             <b>host xterm</b>.

             If the <b>ExitOnForwardFailure </b>configuration option is set to
             “yes”, then a client started with <b>-f </b>will wait for all
             remote port forwards to be successfully established before
             placing itself in the background.  Refer to the description
             of <b>ForkAfterAuthentication </b>in ssh_config(5) for details.

     <b>-G      </b>Causes <b>ssh </b>to print its configuration after evaluating <b>Host</b>
             and <b>Match </b>blocks and exit.

     <b>-g      </b>Allows remote hosts to connect to local forwarded ports.
             If used on a multiplexed connection, then this option must
             be specified on the master process.

     <b>-I </b><i>pkcs11</i>
             Specify the PKCS#11 shared library <b>ssh </b>should use to
             communicate with a PKCS#11 token providing keys for user
             authentication.

     <b>-i </b><i>identity_file</i>
             Selects a file from which the identity (private key) for
             public key authentication is read.  The default is
             <i>~/.ssh/id_dsa</i>, <i>~/.ssh/id_ecdsa</i>, <i>~/.ssh/id_ecdsa_sk</i>,
             <i>~/.ssh/id_ed25519</i>, <i>~/.ssh/id_ed25519_sk</i> and <i>~/.ssh/id_rsa</i>.
             Identity files may also be specified on a per-host basis in
             the configuration file.  It is possible to have multiple <b>-i</b>
             options (and multiple identities specified in configuration
             files).  If no certificates have been explicitly specified
             by the <b>CertificateFile </b>directive, <b>ssh </b>will also try to load
             certificate information from the filename obtained by
             appending <i>-cert.pub</i> to identity filenames.

     <b>-J </b><i>destination</i>
             Connect to the target host by first making a <b>ssh </b>connection
             to the jump host described by <i>destination</i> and then
             establishing a TCP forwarding to the ultimate destination
             from there.  Multiple jump hops may be specified separated
             by comma characters.  This is a shortcut to specify a
             <b>ProxyJump </b>configuration directive.  Note that configuration
             directives supplied on the command-line generally apply to
             the destination host and not any specified jump hosts.  Use
             <i>~/.ssh/config</i> to specify configuration for jump hosts.

     <b>-K      </b>Enables GSSAPI-based authentication and forwarding
             (delegation) of GSSAPI credentials to the server.

     <b>-k      </b>Disables forwarding (delegation) of GSSAPI credentials to
             the server.

     <b>-L </b>[<i>bind_address</i>:]<i>port</i>:<i>host</i>:<i>hostport</i>
     <b>-L </b>[<i>bind_address</i>:]<i>port</i>:<i>remote_socket</i>
     <b>-L </b><i>local_socket</i>:<i>host</i>:<i>hostport</i>
     <b>-L </b><i>local_socket</i>:<i>remote_socket</i>
             Specifies that connections to the given TCP port or Unix
             socket on the local (client) host are to be forwarded to
             the given host and port, or Unix socket, on the remote
             side.  This works by allocating a socket to listen to
             either a TCP <i>port</i> on the local side, optionally bound to
             the specified <i>bind_address</i>, or to a Unix socket.  Whenever
             a connection is made to the local port or socket, the
             connection is forwarded over the secure channel, and a
             connection is made to either <i>host</i> port <i>hostport</i>, or the
             Unix socket <i>remote_socket</i>, from the remote machine.

             Port forwardings can also be specified in the configuration
             file.  Only the superuser can forward privileged ports.
             IPv6 addresses can be specified by enclosing the address in
             square brackets.

             By default, the local port is bound in accordance with the
             <b>GatewayPorts </b>setting.  However, an explicit <i>bind_address</i>
             may be used to bind the connection to a specific address.
             The <i>bind_address</i> of “localhost” indicates that the
             listening port be bound for local use only, while an empty
             address or ‘*’ indicates that the port should be available
             from all interfaces.

     <b>-l </b><i>login_name</i>
             Specifies the user to log in as on the remote machine.
             This also may be specified on a per-host basis in the
             configuration file.

     <b>-M      </b>Places the <b>ssh </b>client into “master” mode for connection
             sharing.  Multiple <b>-M </b>options places <b>ssh </b>into “master” mode
             but with confirmation required using ssh-askpass(1) before
             each operation that changes the multiplexing state (e.g.
             opening a new session).  Refer to the description of
             <b>ControlMaster </b>in ssh_config(5) for details.

     <b>-m </b><i>mac_spec</i>
             A comma-separated list of MAC (message authentication code)
             algorithms, specified in order of preference.  See the <b>MACs</b>
             keyword for more information.

     <b>-N      </b>Do not execute a remote command.  This is useful for just
             forwarding ports.  Refer to the description of <b>SessionType</b>
             in ssh_config(5) for details.

     <b>-n      </b>Redirects stdin from <i>/dev/null</i> (actually, prevents reading
             from stdin).  This must be used when <b>ssh </b>is run in the
             background.  A common trick is to use this to run X11
             programs on a remote machine.  For example, <b>ssh -n</b>
             <b>shadows.cs.hut.fi emacs &amp; </b>will start an emacs on
             shadows.cs.hut.fi, and the X11 connection will be
             automatically forwarded over an encrypted channel.  The <b>ssh</b>
             program will be put in the background.  (This does not work
             if <b>ssh </b>needs to ask for a password or passphrase; see also
             the <b>-f </b>option.)  Refer to the description of <b>StdinNull </b>in
             ssh_config(5) for details.

     <b>-O </b><i>ctl_cmd</i>
             Control an active connection multiplexing master process.
             When the <b>-O </b>option is specified, the <i>ctl_cmd</i> argument is
             interpreted and passed to the master process.  Valid
             commands are: “check” (check that the master process is
             running), “forward” (request forwardings without command
             execution), “cancel” (cancel forwardings), “exit” (request
             the master to exit), and “stop” (request the master to stop
             accepting further multiplexing requests).

     <b>-o </b><i>option</i>
             Can be used to give options in the format used in the
             configuration file.  This is useful for specifying options
             for which there is no separate command-line flag.  For full
             details of the options listed below, and their possible
             values, see ssh_config(5).

     <b>-Q </b><i>query_option</i>

             <i>cipher-auth</i> (supported symmetric ciphers that support
             authenticated encryption), <i>help</i> (supported query terms for
             use with the <b>-Q </b>flag), <i>mac</i> (supported message integrity
             codes), <i>kex</i> (key exchange algorithms), <i>key</i> (key types),
             <i>key-cert</i> (certificate key types), <i>key-plain</i> (non-
             certificate key types), <i>key-sig</i> (all key types and

             protocol versions), and <i>sig</i> (supported signature
             algorithms).  Alternatively, any keyword from ssh_config(5)
             or sshd_config(5) that takes an algorithm list may be used
             as an alias for the corresponding query_option.

     <b>-q      </b>Quiet mode.  Causes most warning and diagnostic messages to
             be suppressed.

     <b>-R </b><i>remote_socket</i>:<i>local_socket</i>
     <b>-R </b>[<i>bind_address</i>:]<i>port</i>
             Specifies that connections to the given TCP port or Unix
             socket on the remote (server) host are to be forwarded to
             the local side.

             This works by allocating a socket to listen to either a TCP
             <i>port</i> or to a Unix socket on the remote side.  Whenever a
             connection is made to this port or Unix socket, the
             connection is forwarded over the secure channel, and a
             connection is made from the local machine to either an
             explicit destination specified by <i>host</i> port <i>hostport</i>, or
             <i>local_socket</i>, or, if no explicit destination was specified,
             <b>ssh </b>will act as a SOCKS 4/5 proxy and forward connections
             to the destinations requested by the remote SOCKS client.

             Port forwardings can also be specified in the configuration
             file.  Privileged ports can be forwarded only when logging
             in as root on the remote machine.  IPv6 addresses can be
             specified by enclosing the address in square brackets.

             By default, TCP listening sockets on the server will be
             bound to the loopback interface only.  This may be
             overridden by specifying a <i>bind_address</i>.  An empty
             <i>bind_address</i>, or the address ‘*’, indicates that the remote
             socket should listen on all interfaces.  Specifying a
             remote <i>bind_address</i> will only succeed if the server's
             <b>GatewayPorts </b>option is enabled (see sshd_config(5)).

             If the <i>port</i> argument is ‘0’, the listen port will be
             dynamically allocated on the server and reported to the
             client at run time.  When used together with <b>-O forward </b>the
             allocated port will be printed to the standard output.

     <b>-S </b><i>ctl_path</i>
             Specifies the location of a control socket for connection
             sharing, or the string “none” to disable connection
             sharing.  Refer to the description of <b>ControlPath </b>and
             <b>ControlMaster </b>in ssh_config(5) for details.

     <b>-s      </b>May be used to request invocation of a subsystem on the
             remote system.  Subsystems facilitate the use of SSH as a
             secure transport for other applications (e.g. sftp(1)).
             The subsystem is specified as the remote command.  Refer to
             the description of <b>SessionType </b>in ssh_config(5) for
             details.

     <b>-T      </b>Disable pseudo-terminal allocation.

     <b>-t      </b>Force pseudo-terminal allocation.  This can be used to
             execute arbitrary screen-based programs on a remote
             machine, which can be very useful, e.g. when implementing
             menu services.  Multiple <b>-t </b>options force tty allocation,
             even if <b>ssh </b>has no local tty.

     <b>-V      </b>Display the version number and exit.

     <b>-v      </b>Verbose mode.  Causes <b>ssh </b>to print debugging messages about
             its progress.  This is helpful in debugging connection,
             authentication, and configuration problems.  Multiple <b>-v</b>
             options increase the verbosity.  The maximum is 3.

     <b>-W </b><i>host</i>:<i>port</i>
             Requests that standard input and output on the client be
             forwarded to <i>host</i> on <i>port</i> over the secure channel.  Implies
             <b>-N</b>, <b>-T</b>, <b>ExitOnForwardFailure </b>and <b>ClearAllForwardings</b>,
             though these can be overridden in the configuration file or
             using <b>-o </b>command line options.

     <b>-w </b><i>local_tun</i>[:<i>remote_tun</i>]
             Requests tunnel device forwarding with the specified tun(4)
             devices between the client (<i>local_tun</i>) and the server
             (<i>remote_tun</i>).

             The devices may be specified by numerical ID or the keyword
             “any”, which uses the next available tunnel device.  If
             <i>remote_tun</i> is not specified, it defaults to “any”.  See
             also the <b>Tunnel </b>and <b>TunnelDevice </b>directives in
             ssh_config(5).

             If the <b>Tunnel </b>directive is unset, it will be set to the
             default tunnel mode, which is “point-to-point”.  If a
             different <b>Tunnel </b>forwarding mode it desired, then it should
             be specified before <b>-w</b>.

     <b>-X      </b>Enables X11 forwarding.  This can also be specified on a
             per-host basis in a configuration file.

             X11 forwarding should be enabled with caution.  Users with
             the ability to bypass file permissions on the remote host
             (for the user's X authorization database) can access the
             local X11 display through the forwarded connection.  An
             attacker may then be able to perform activities such as
             keystroke monitoring.

             For this reason, X11 forwarding is subjected to X11
             SECURITY extension restrictions by default.  Please refer
             to the <b>ssh -Y </b>option and the <b>ForwardX11Trusted </b>directive in
             ssh_config(5) for more information.

     <b>-x      </b>Disables X11 forwarding.

     <b>-Y      </b>Enables trusted X11 forwarding.  Trusted X11 forwardings
             are not subjected to the X11 SECURITY extension controls.

     <b>-y      </b>Send log information using the syslog(3) system module.  By
             default this information is sent to stderr.

     <b>ssh </b>may additionally obtain configuration data from a per-user
     configuration file and a system-wide configuration file.  The file
     format and configuration options are described in ssh_config(5).
