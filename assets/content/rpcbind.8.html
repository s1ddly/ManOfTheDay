     The <b>rpcbind </b>utility is a server that converts RPC program numbers
     into universal addresses.  It must be running on the host to be
     able to make RPC calls on a server on that machine.

     When an RPC service is started, it tells <b>rpcbind </b>the address at
     which it is listening, and the RPC program numbers it is prepared
     to serve.  When a client wishes to make an RPC call to a given
     program number, it first contacts <b>rpcbind </b>on the server machine to
     determine the address where RPC requests should be sent.

     The <b>rpcbind </b>utility should be started before any other RPC service.
     Normally, standard RPC servers are started by port monitors, so
     <b>rpcbind </b>must be started before port monitors are invoked.

     When <b>rpcbind </b>is started, it checks that certain name-to-address
     translation-calls function correctly.  If they fail, the network
     configuration databases may be corrupt.  Since RPC services cannot
     function correctly in this situation, <b>rpcbind </b>reports the condition
     and terminates.

     The <b>rpcbind </b>utility can only be started by the super-user.
