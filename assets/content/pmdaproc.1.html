       <b>pmdaproc </b>is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
       extracts performance metrics describing the state of the
       individual processes running on a Linux system.

       The <b>proc </b>PMDA exports metrics that measure the memory, processor
       and other resource use of each process, as well as summary
       information collated across all of the running processes.  The
       PMDA uses credentials passed from the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/PMAPI.3.html">PMAPI(3)</a> monitoring tool
       identifying the user requesting the information, to ensure that
       only values the user is allowed to access are returned by the
       PMDA.  This involves the PMDA temporarily changing its effective
       user and group identifiers for the duration of requests for
       instances and values.  In other words, system calls to extract
       information are performed as the user originating the request and
       not as a privileged user.  The mechanisms available for transfer
       of user credentials are described further in the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/PCPIntro.1.html">PCPIntro(1)</a>
       page.

       A brief description of the <b>pmdaproc </b>command line options follows:

       <b>-A   </b>Disables use of the credentials provided by <b>PMAPI </b>client
            tools, and simply runs everything under the "root" account.
            Only enable this option if you understand the risks
            involved, and are sure that all remote accesses will be from
            benevolent users.  If enabled, unauthenticated remote <b>PMAPI</b>
            clients will be able to access potentially sensitive
            performance metric values which an unauthenticated <b>PMAPI</b>
            client usually would not be able to.  Refer to CVE-2012-3419
            for additional details.

       <b>-L   </b>Changes the per-process instance domain used by most
            <b>pmdaproc </b>metrics to include threads as well.

       <b>-d   </b>It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics <i>domain</i>
            number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is,
            <i>domain</i> should be different for every PMDA on the one host,
            and the same <i>domain</i> number should be used for the same PMDA
            on all hosts.

       <b>-l   </b>Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
            <i>proc.log</i> is written in the current directory of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> when
            <b>pmdaproc </b>is started, i.e.  <b>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd</b>.  If the log
            file cannot be created or is not writable, output is written
            to the standard error instead.

       <b>-r   </b>Restrict the set of processes exported in the per-process
            instance domain to only those processes that are contained
            by the specified <i>cgroup</i> resource container.  This option
            provides an optional finer granularity to the monitoring,
            and can also be used to reduce the resources consumed by
            <i>pmdaproc</i> during requests for instances and values.

       <b>-U   </b>User account under which to run the agent.  The default is
            the privileged "root" account, with seteuid (2) and setegid
            (2) switching for accessing most information.
