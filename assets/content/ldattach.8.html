<pre>
       The <b>ldattach </b>daemon opens the specified <i>device</i> file (which should
       refer to a serial device) and attaches the line discipline <i>ldisc</i>
       to it for processing of the sent and/or received data. It then
       goes into the background keeping the device open so that the line
       discipline stays loaded.

       The line discipline <i>ldisc</i> may be specified either by name or by
       number.

       In order to detach the line discipline, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/kill.1.html">kill(1)</a> the <b>ldattach</b>
       process.

       With no arguments, <b>ldattach </b>prints usage information.
