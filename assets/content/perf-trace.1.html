       This command will show the events associated with the target,
       initially syscalls, but other system events like pagefaults, task
       lifetime events, scheduling events, etc.

       This is a live mode tool in addition to working with perf.data
       files like the other perf tools. Files can be generated using the
       <i>perf record</i> command but the session needs to include the
       raw_syscalls events (-e <i>raw_syscalls:*</i>). Alternatively, <i>perf</i>
       <i>trace record</i> can be used as a shortcut to automatically include
       the raw_syscalls events when writing events to a file.

       The following options apply to perf trace; options to perf trace
       record are found in the perf record man page.
