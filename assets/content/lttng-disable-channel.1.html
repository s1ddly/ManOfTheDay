<pre>
       The <b>lttng disable-channel </b>command disables one or more channels
       previously enabled by the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/lttng-enable-channel.1.html">lttng-enable-channel(1)</a> command.

       A channel is always contained in a tracing session (see
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/lttng-create.1.html">lttng-create(1)</a> for creating a tracing session). The session in
       which a channel is disabled using <b>lttng disable-channel </b>can be
       specified using the <b>--session </b>option. If the <b>--session </b>option is
       omitted, the current tracing session is targeted.

       Note that re-enabling a disabled channel once its tracing session
       has been active at least once is currently not supported.
