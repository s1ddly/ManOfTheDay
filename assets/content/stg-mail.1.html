<pre>
       Send a patch or a range of patches by e-mail using the SMTP
       server specified by the <i>stgit.smtpserver</i> configuration option, or
       the <i>--smtp-server</i> command line option. This option can also be an
       absolute path to <i>sendmail</i> followed by command line arguments.

       The From address and the e-mail format are generated from the
       template file passed as argument to <i>--template</i> (defaulting to
       <i>.git/patchmail.tmpl</i> or <i>~/.stgit/templates/patchmail.tmpl</i> or
       <i>/usr/share/stgit/templates/patchmail.tmpl</i>). A patch can be sent
       as attachment using the --attach option in which case the
       <i>mailattch.tmpl</i> template will be used instead of <i>patchmail.tmpl</i>.

       The To/Cc/Bcc addresses can either be added to the template file
       or passed via the corresponding command line options. They can be
       e-mail addresses or aliases which are automatically expanded to
       the values stored in the [mail "alias"] section of GIT
       configuration files.

       A preamble e-mail can be sent using the <i>--cover</i> and/or
       <i>--edit-cover</i> options. The first allows the user to specify a file
       to be used as a template. The latter option will invoke the
       editor on the specified file (defaulting to <i>.git/covermail.tmpl</i>
       or <i>~/.stgit/templates/covermail.tmpl</i> or
       <i>/usr/share/stgit/templates/covermail.tmpl</i>).

       All the subsequent e-mails appear as replies to the first e-mail
       sent (either the preamble or the first patch). E-mails can be
       seen as replies to a different e-mail by using the <i>--in-reply-to</i>
       option.

       SMTP authentication is also possible with <i>--smtp-user</i> and
       <i>--smtp-password</i> options, also available as configuration
       settings: <i>smtpuser</i> and <i>smtppassword</i>. TLS encryption can be
       enabled by <i>--smtp-tls</i> option and <i>smtptls</i> setting.

       The following variables are accepted by both the preamble and the
       patch e-mail templates:

           %(diffstat)s     - diff statistics
           %(number)s       - empty if only one patch is sent or 'patchnr/totalnr'
           %(snumber)s      - stripped version of '%(number)s'
           %(nspace)s       - ' ' if %(number)s is non-empty, otherwise empty string
           %(patchnr)s      - patch number
           %(sender)s       - 'sender'  or 'authname &lt;authemail&gt;' as per the config file
           %(totalnr)s      - total number of patches to be sent
           %(version)s      - 'version' string passed on the command line (or empty)
           %(vspace)s       - ' ' if %(version)s is non-empty, otherwise empty string

       In addition to the common variables, the preamble e-mail template
       accepts the following:

           %(shortlog)s     - first line of each patch description, listed by author

       In addition to the common variables, the patch e-mail template
       accepts the following:

           %(authdate)s     - patch creation date
           %(authemail)s    - author's email
           %(authname)s     - author's name
           %(commemail)s    - committer's e-mail
           %(commname)s     - committer's name
           %(diff)s         - unified diff of the patch
           %(fromauth)s     - 'From: author\n\n' if different from sender
           %(longdescr)s    - the rest of the patch description, after the first line
           %(patch)s        - patch name
           %(prefix)s       - 'prefix' string passed on the command line
           %(pspace)s       - ' ' if %(prefix)s is non-empty, otherwise empty string
           %(shortdescr)s   - the first line of the patch description
