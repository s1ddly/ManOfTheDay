       The <b>gpasswd </b>command is used to administer /etc/group, and
       /etc/gshadow. Every group can have administrators, members and a
       password.

       System administrators can use the <b>-A </b>option to define group
       administrator(s) and the <b>-M </b>option to define members. They have
       all rights of group administrators and members.

       <b>gpasswd </b>called by a group administrator with a group name only
       prompts for the new password of the <i>group</i>.

       If a password is set the members can still use <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/newgrp.1.html">newgrp(1)</a> without
       a password, and non-members must supply the password.

   <b>Notes about group passwords</b>
       Group passwords are an inherent security problem since more than
       one person is permitted to know the password. However, groups are
       a useful tool for permitting co-operation between different
       users.
