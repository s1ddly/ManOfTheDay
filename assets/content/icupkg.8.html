       <b>icupkg </b>reads the input ICU <b>.dat </b>package file, modify it according
       to the options, swap it to the desired platform properties
       (charset &amp; endianness), and optionally write the resulting ICU
       <b>.dat </b>package to the output file.  Items are removed, then added,
       then extracted and listed.  An ICU <b>.dat </b>package is written if
       items are removed or added, or if the input and output filenames
       differ, or if the <b>-w</b>, <b>--writepkg </b>option is set.

       If the input filename is "new" then an empty package is created.
       If the output filename is missing, then it is automatically
       generated from the input filename. If the input filename ends
       with an l, b, or e matching its platform properties, then the
       output filename will contain the letter from the <b>-t</b>, <b>--type</b>
       option.

       This tool can also be used to just swap a single ICU data file,
       replacing the former icuswap tool. For this mode, provide the
       infilename (and optional outfilename) for a non-package ICU data
       file.  Allowed options include <b>-t</b>, <b>-w</b>, <b>-s </b>and <b>-d </b>The filenames
       can be absolute, or relative to the source/dest dir paths.  Other
       options are not allowed in this mode.
