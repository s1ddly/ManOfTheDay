       Each manual page has a short description available within it.
       <b>apropos </b>searches the descriptions for instances of <i>keyword</i>.

       <i>keyword</i> is usually a regular expression, as if (<b>-r</b>) was used, or
       may contain wildcards (<b>-w</b>), or match the exact keyword (<b>-e</b>).
       Using these options, it may be necessary to quote the <i>keyword</i> or
       escape (\) the special characters to stop the shell from
       interpreting them.

       The standard matching rules allow matches to be made against the
       page name and word boundaries in the description.

       The database searched by <b>apropos </b>is updated by the <b>mandb </b>program.
       Depending on your installation, this may be run by a periodic
       cron job, or may need to be run manually after new manual pages
       have been installed.
