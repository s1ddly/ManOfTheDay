       The <i>alias</i> utility shall create or redefine alias definitions or
       write the values of existing alias definitions to standard
       output. An alias definition provides a string value that shall
       replace a command name when it is encountered; see <i>Section 2.3.1</i>,
       <i>Alias Substitution</i>.

       An alias definition shall affect the current shell execution
       environment and the execution environments of the subshells of
       the current shell. When used as specified by this volume of
       POSIX.1‚Äê2017, the alias definition shall not affect the parent
       process of the current shell nor any utility environment invoked
       by the shell; see <i>Section 2.12</i>, <i>Shell Execution Environment</i>.
