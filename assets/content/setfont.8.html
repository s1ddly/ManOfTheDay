       The <b>setfont </b>command reads a font from the file <i>font.new</i> and loads
       it into the EGA/VGA character generator, and optionally outputs
       the previous font.  It can also load various mapping tables and
       output the previous versions.

       If no args are given (or only the option -<i>N</i> for some number <i>N</i>),
       then a default (8x<i>N</i>) font is loaded (see below).  One may give
       several small fonts, all containing a Unicode table, and <b>setfont</b>
       will combine them and load the union.  Typical use:

       <b>setfont</b>
              Load a default font.

       <b>setfont drdos8x16</b>
              Load a given font (here the 448-glyph drdos font).

       <b>setfont cybercafe -u cybercafe</b>
              Load a given font that does not have a Unicode map and
              provide one explicitly.

       <b>setfont LatArCyrHeb-19 -m 8859-2</b>
              Load a given font (here a 512-glyph font combining several
              character sets) and indicate that one's local character
              set is ISO 8859-2.

       Note: if a font has more than 256 glyphs, only 8 out of 16 colors
       can be used simultaneously. It can make console perception worse
       (loss of intensity and even some colors).
