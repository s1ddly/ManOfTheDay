<pre>
       The first synopsis form is denoted by two operands, neither of
       which are existing files of type directory. The <i>cp</i> utility shall
       copy the contents of <i>source_file</i> (or, if <i>source_file</i> is a file of
       type symbolic link, the contents of the file referenced by
       <i>source_file</i>) to the destination path named by <i>target_file.</i>

       The second synopsis form is denoted by two or more operands where
       the <b>-R </b>option is not specified and the first synopsis form is not
       applicable. It shall be an error if any <i>source_file</i> is a file of
       type directory, if <i>target</i> does not exist, or if <i>target</i> does not
       name a directory. The <i>cp</i> utility shall copy the contents of each
       <i>source_file</i> (or, if <i>source_file</i> is a file of type symbolic link,
       the contents of the file referenced by <i>source_file</i>) to the
       destination path named by the concatenation of <i>target</i>, a single
       &lt;slash&gt; character if <i>target</i> did not end in a &lt;slash&gt;, and the
       last component of <i>source_file</i>.

       The third synopsis form is denoted by two or more operands where
       the <b>-R </b>option is specified. The <i>cp</i> utility shall copy each file
       in the file hierarchy rooted in each <i>source_file</i> to a destination
       path named as follows:

        *  If <i>target</i> exists and names an existing directory, the name of
           the corresponding destination path for each file in the file
           hierarchy shall be the concatenation of <i>target</i>, a single
           &lt;slash&gt; character if <i>target</i> did not end in a &lt;slash&gt;, and the
           pathname of the file relative to the directory containing
           <i>source_file</i>.

        *  If <i>target</i> does not exist and two operands are specified, the
           name of the corresponding destination path for <i>source_file</i>
           shall be <i>target</i>; the name of the corresponding destination
           path for all other files in the file hierarchy shall be the
           concatenation of <i>target</i>, a &lt;slash&gt; character, and the
           pathname of the file relative to <i>source_file</i>.

       It shall be an error if <i>target</i> does not exist and more than two
       operands are specified, or if <i>target</i> exists and does not name a
       directory.

       In the following description, the term <i>dest_file</i> refers to the
       file named by the destination path. The term <i>source_file</i> refers
       to the file that is being copied, whether specified as an operand
       or a file in a file hierarchy rooted in a <i>source_file</i> operand. If
       <i>source_file</i> is a file of type symbolic link:

        *  If the <b>-R </b>option was not specified, <i>cp</i> shall take actions
           based on the type and contents of the file referenced by the
           symbolic link, and not by the symbolic link itself, unless
           the <b>-P </b>option was specified.

        *  If the <b>-R </b>option was specified:

           --  If none of the options <b>-H</b>, <b>-L</b>, nor <b>-P </b>were specified, it
               is unspecified which of <b>-H</b>, <b>-L</b>, or <b>-P </b>will be used as a
               default.

           --  If the <b>-H </b>option was specified, <i>cp</i> shall take actions
               based on the type and contents of the file referenced by
               any symbolic link specified as a <i>source_file</i> operand.

           --  If the <b>-L </b>option was specified, <i>cp</i> shall take actions
               based on the type and contents of the file referenced by
               any symbolic link specified as a <i>source_file</i> operand or
               any symbolic links encountered during traversal of a file
               hierarchy.

           --  If the <b>-P </b>option was specified, <i>cp</i> shall copy any
               symbolic link specified as a <i>source_file</i> operand and any
               symbolic links encountered during traversal of a file
               hierarchy, and shall not follow any symbolic links.

       For each <i>source_file</i>, the following steps shall be taken:

        1. If <i>source_file</i> references the same file as <i>dest_file</i>, <i>cp</i> may
           write a diagnostic message to standard error; it shall do
           nothing more with <i>source_file</i> and shall go on to any
           remaining files.

        2. If <i>source_file</i> is of type directory, the following steps
           shall be taken:

            a. If the <b>-R </b>option was not specified, <i>cp</i> shall write a
               diagnostic message to standard error, do nothing more
               with <i>source_file</i>, and go on to any remaining files.

            b. If <i>source_file</i> was not specified as an operand and
               <i>source_file</i> is dot or dot-dot, <i>cp</i> shall do nothing more
               with <i>source_file</i> and go on to any remaining files.

            c. If <i>dest_file</i> exists and it is a file type not specified
               by the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017, the
               behavior is implementation-defined.

            d. If <i>dest_file</i> exists and it is not of type directory, <i>cp</i>
               shall write a diagnostic message to standard error, do
               nothing more with <i>source_file</i> or any files below
               <i>source_file</i> in the file hierarchy, and go on to any
               remaining files.

            e. If the directory <i>dest_file</i> does not exist, it shall be
               created with file permission bits set to the same value
               as those of <i>source_file</i>, modified by the file creation
               mask of the user if the <b>-p </b>option was not specified, and
               then bitwise-inclusively OR'ed with S_IRWXU. If <i>dest_file</i>
               cannot be created, <i>cp</i> shall write a diagnostic message to
               standard error, do nothing more with <i>source_file</i>, and go
               on to any remaining files. It is unspecified if <i>cp</i>
               attempts to copy files in the file hierarchy rooted in
               <i>source_file</i>.

            f. The files in the directory <i>source_file</i> shall be copied to
               the directory <i>dest_file</i>, taking the four steps (1 to 4)
               listed here with the files as <i>source_file</i>s.

            g. If <i>dest_file</i> was created, its file permission bits shall
               be changed (if necessary) to be the same as those of
               <i>source_file</i>, modified by the file creation mask of the
               user if the <b>-p </b>option was not specified.

            h. The <i>cp</i> utility shall do nothing more with <i>source_file</i> and
               go on to any remaining files.

        3. If <i>source_file</i> is of type regular file, the following steps
           shall be taken:

            a. The behavior is unspecified if <i>dest_file</i> exists and was
               written by a previous step. Otherwise, if <i>dest_file</i>
               exists, the following steps shall be taken:

                i.  If the <b>-i </b>option is in effect, the <i>cp</i> utility shall
                    write a prompt to the standard error and read a line
                    from the standard input. If the response is not
                    affirmative, <i>cp</i> shall do nothing more with
                    <i>source_file</i> and go on to any remaining files.

               ii.  A file descriptor for <i>dest_file</i> shall be obtained by
                    performing actions equivalent to the <i>open</i>() function
                    defined in the System Interfaces volume of
                    POSIX.1‐2017 called using <i>dest_file</i> as the <i>path</i>
                    argument, and the bitwise-inclusive OR of O_WRONLY
                    and O_TRUNC as the <i>oflag</i> argument.

               iii. If the attempt to obtain a file descriptor fails and
                    the <b>-f </b>option is in effect, <i>cp</i> shall attempt to
                    remove the file by performing actions equivalent to
                    the <i>unlink</i>() function defined in the System
                    Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017 called using
                    <i>dest_file</i> as the <i>path</i> argument. If this attempt
                    succeeds, <i>cp</i> shall continue with step 3b.

            b. If <i>dest_file</i> does not exist, a file descriptor shall be
               obtained by performing actions equivalent to the <i>open</i>()
               function defined in the System Interfaces volume of
               POSIX.1‐2017 called using <i>dest_file</i> as the <i>path</i> argument,
               and the bitwise-inclusive OR of O_WRONLY and O_CREAT as
               the <i>oflag</i> argument. The file permission bits of
               <i>source_file</i> shall be the <i>mode</i> argument.

            c. If the attempt to obtain a file descriptor fails, <i>cp</i>
               shall write a diagnostic message to standard error, do
               nothing more with <i>source_file</i>, and go on to any remaining
               files.

            d. The contents of <i>source_file</i> shall be written to the file
               descriptor. Any write errors shall cause <i>cp</i> to write a
               diagnostic message to standard error and continue to step
               3e.

            e. The file descriptor shall be closed.

            f. The <i>cp</i> utility shall do nothing more with <i>source_file</i>.
               If a write error occurred in step 3d, it is unspecified
               if <i>cp</i> continues with any remaining files. If no write
               error occurred in step 3d, <i>cp</i> shall go on to any
               remaining files.

        4. Otherwise, the <b>-R </b>option was specified, and the following
           steps shall be taken:

            a. The <i>dest_file</i> shall be created with the same file type as
               <i>source_file</i>.

            b. If <i>source_file</i> is a file of type FIFO, the file
               permission bits shall be the same as those of
               <i>source_file,</i> modified by the file creation mask of the
               user if the <b>-p </b>option was not specified. Otherwise, the
               permissions, owner ID, and group ID of <i>dest_file</i> are
               implementation-defined.

               If this creation fails for any reason, <i>cp</i> shall write a
               diagnostic message to standard error, do nothing more
               with <i>source_file</i>, and go on to any remaining files.

            c. If <i>source_file</i> is a file of type symbolic link, and the
               options require the symbolic link itself to be acted
               upon, the pathname contained in <i>dest_file</i> shall be the
               same as the pathname contained in <i>source_file</i>.

               If this fails for any reason, <i>cp</i> shall write a diagnostic
               message to standard error, do nothing more with
               <i>source_file</i>, and go on to any remaining files.

       If the implementation provides additional or alternate access
       control mechanisms (see the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 4.5</i>, <i>File Access Permissions</i>), their effect
       on copies of files is implementation-defined.
