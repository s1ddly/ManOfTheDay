<pre>
       A simple CGI program to serve the contents of a Git repository to
       Git clients accessing the repository over <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pagestp://">http://</a> and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pagestps://">https://</a>
       protocols. The program supports clients fetching using both the
       smart HTTP protocol and the backwards-compatible dumb HTTP
       protocol, as well as clients pushing using the smart HTTP
       protocol.

       It verifies that the directory has the magic file
       "git-daemon-export-ok", and it will refuse to export any Git
       directory that hasnâ€™t explicitly been marked for export this way
       (unless the <b>GIT_HTTP_EXPORT_ALL </b>environmental variable is set).

       By default, only the <b>upload-pack </b>service is enabled, which serves
       <i>git fetch-pack</i> and <i>git ls-remote</i> clients, which are invoked from
       <i>git fetch</i>, <i>git pull</i>, and <i>git clone</i>. If the client is
       authenticated, the <b>receive-pack </b>service is enabled, which serves
       <i>git send-pack</i> clients, which is invoked from <i>git push</i>.
