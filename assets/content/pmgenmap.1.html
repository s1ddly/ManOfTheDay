       Given one or more lists of metric names in <i>infile</i> or on standard
       input, <b>pmgenmap </b>generates C declarations and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/cpp.1.html">cpp(1)</a> macros
       suitable for use across the Performance Metrics Programming
       Interface (PMAPI) on standard output.

       The declarations produced by <b>pmgenmap </b>simplify the coding for
       client applications using the PMAPI.

       The input should consist of one or more lists of metric names of
       the form

            listname {
                metricname1 symbolname1
                metricname2 symbolname2
                ...
            }

       which will generate C and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/cpp.1.html">cpp(1)</a> declarations of the form

            char *listname[] = {
            #define symbolname1 0
                "metricname1",
            #define symbolname2 1
                "metricname2",
                ...
            };

       The array declarations produced are suitable as parameters to
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/pmLookupName.3.html">pmLookupName(3)</a> and the <b>#define</b>d constants may be used to index
       the <i>vset</i>s in the <i>pmResult</i> structure returned by a <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/pmFetch.3.html">pmFetch(3)</a>
       call.

       Obviously, <i>listname</i> must conform to the C identifier naming
       rules, each <i>symbolname</i> must conform to the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/cpp.1.html">cpp(1)</a> macro naming
       rules, and each <i>metricname</i> is expected to be a valid performance
       metrics name (see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/PMNS.5.html">PMNS(5)</a> for more details).

       The input may include <b>sh</b>-style comment lines, i.e. with a `<b>#</b>' as
       the first non-blank character of a line, and these are translated
       on output to either single line or multi-line C comments in the
       K&amp;R style.  For example, the input:

            # leading block of multi-line comments
            # initialization group
            foo {
                    a.b.c   ONE
                    d.e.f.g TWO
                    # embedded block of multi-lines
                    # comments and boring pad text
                    xx.yy.zz        THREE
            }

            # trailing single line comment

       Produces the output:

            /*
             * leading block of multi-line comments
             * initialization group
             */
            char *foo[] = {
            #define ONE 0
                    "a.b.c",
            #define TWO 1
                    "d.e.f.g",
            /*
             * embedded block of multi-lines
             * comments and boring pad text
             */
            #define THREE 2
                    "xx.yy.zz",

            };

            /* trailing single line comment */
