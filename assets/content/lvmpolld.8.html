       lvmpolld is polling daemon for LVM. The daemon receives requests
       for polling of already initialised operations originating in LVM2
       command line tool.  The requests for polling originate in the
       <b>lvconvert</b>, <b>pvmove</b>, <b>lvchange </b>or <b>vgchange </b>LVM2 commands.

       The purpose of lvmpolld is to reduce the number of spawned
       background processes per otherwise unique polling operation.
       There should be only one. It also eliminates the possibility of
       unsolicited termination of background process by external
       factors.

       lvmpolld is used by LVM only if it is enabled in <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/lvm.conf.5.html">lvm.conf(5)</a> by
       specifying the <b>global/use_lvmpolld </b>setting. If this is not
       defined in the LVM configuration explicitly then default setting
       is used instead (see the output of <b>lvmconfig --type default</b>
       <b>global/use_lvmpolld </b>command).
