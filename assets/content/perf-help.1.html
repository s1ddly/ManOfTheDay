       With no options and no COMMAND given, the synopsis of the <i>perf</i>
       command and a list of the most commonly used perf commands are
       printed on the standard output.

       If the option <i>--all</i> or <i>-a</i> is given, then all available commands
       are printed on the standard output.

       If a perf command is named, a manual page for that command is
       brought up. The <i>man</i> program is used by default for this purpose,
       but this can be overridden by other options or configuration
       variables.

       Note that perf --help ... is identical to perf help ... because
       the former is internally converted into the latter.
