       <b>dpkg-split </b>splits Debian binary package files into smaller parts
       and reassembles them again, to support the storage of large
       package files on small media such as floppy disks.

       It can be operated manually using the <b>--split</b>, <b>--join </b>and <b>--info</b>
       options.

       It also has an automatic mode, invoked using the <b>--auto </b>option,
       where it maintains a queue of parts seen but not yet reassembled
       and reassembles a package file when it has seen all of its parts.
       The <b>--listq </b>and <b>--discard </b>options allow the management of the
       queue.

       All splitting, joining and queueing operations produce
       informative messages on standard output; these may safely be
       ignored.
