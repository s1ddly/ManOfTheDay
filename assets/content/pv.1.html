       <b>pv </b>shows the progress of data through a pipeline by giving
       information such as time elapsed, percentage completed (with
       progress bar), current throughput rate, total data transferred,
       and ETA.

       To use it, insert it in a pipeline between two processes, with
       the appropriate options.  Its standard input will be passed
       through to its standard output and progress will be shown on
       standard error.

       <b>pv </b>will copy each supplied <b>FILE </b>in turn to standard output (<b>-</b>
       means standard input), or if no <b>FILE</b>s are specified just standard
       input is copied. This is the same behaviour as <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/cat.1.html">cat(1)</a>.

       A simple example to watch how quickly a file is transferred using
       <b>nc</b>(1):

              <b>pv file | nc -w 1 somewhere.com 3000</b>

       A similar example, transferring a file from another process and
       passing the expected size to <b>pv</b>:

              <b>cat file | pv -s 12345 | nc -w 1 somewhere.com 3000</b>

       A more complicated example using numeric output to feed into the
       <b>dialog</b>(1) program for a full-screen progress display:

              <b>(tar cf - . \</b>
               <b>| pv -n -s $(du -sb . | awk '{print $1}') \</b>
               <b>| gzip -9 &gt; out.tgz) 2&gt;&amp;1 \</b>
              <b>| dialog --gauge 'Progress' 7 70</b>

       Taking an image of a disk, skipping errors:

              <b>pv -EE /dev/sda &gt; disk-image.img</b>

       Writing an image back to a disk:

              <b>pv disk-image.img &gt; /dev/sda</b>

       Zeroing a disk:

              <b>pv &lt; /dev/zero &gt; /dev/sda</b>

       Note that if the input size cannot be calculated, and the output
       is a block device, then the size of the block device will be used
       and <b>pv </b>will automatically stop at that size as if <b>-S </b>had been
       given.
