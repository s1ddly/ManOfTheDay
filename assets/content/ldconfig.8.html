       <b>ldconfig </b>creates the necessary links and cache to the most recent
       shared libraries found in the directories specified on the
       command line, in the file <i>/etc/ld.so.conf</i>, and in the trusted
       directories, <i>/lib</i> and <i>/usr/lib</i> (on some 64-bit architectures such
       as x86-64, <i>/lib</i> and <i>/usr/lib</i> are the trusted directories for
       32-bit libraries, while <i>/lib64</i> and <i>/usr/lib64</i> are used for 64-bit
       libraries).

       The cache is used by the run-time linker, <i>ld.so</i> or <i>ld-linux.so</i>.
       <b>ldconfig </b>checks the header and filenames of the libraries it
       encounters when determining which versions should have their
       links updated.

       <b>ldconfig </b>will attempt to deduce the type of ELF libraries (i.e.,
       libc5 or libc6/glibc) based on what C libraries, if any, the
       library was linked against.

       Some existing libraries do not contain enough information to
       allow the deduction of their type.  Therefore, the
       <i>/etc/ld.so.conf</i> file format allows the specification of an
       expected type.  This is used <i>only</i> for those ELF libraries which
       we can not work out.  The format is "dirname=TYPE", where TYPE
       can be libc4, libc5, or libc6.  (This syntax also works on the
       command line.)  Spaces are <i>not</i> allowed.  Also see the <b>-p </b>option.
       <b>ldconfig </b>should normally be run by the superuser as it may
       require write permission on some root owned directories and
       files.

       Note that <b>ldconfig </b>will only look at files that are named
       <i>lib*.so*</i> (for regular shared objects) or <i>ld-*.so*</i> (for the
       dynamic loader itself).  Other files will be ignored.  Also,
       <b>ldconfig </b>expects a certain pattern to how the symlinks are set
       up, like this example, where the middle file (<b>libfoo.so.1 </b>here)
       is the SONAME for the library:

           libfoo.so -&gt; libfoo.so.1 -&gt; libfoo.so.1.12

       Failure to follow this pattern may result in compatibility issues
       after an upgrade.
