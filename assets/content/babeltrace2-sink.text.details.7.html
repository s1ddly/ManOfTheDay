       A Babeltrace 2 <b>sink.text.details </b>component deterministically
       prints the messages it consumes, with all the possible details,
       to the standard output.

                       +-------------------+
                       | sink.text.details |
                       |                   +--&gt; Detailed messages to the
           Messages --&gt;@ in                |    standard output
                       +-------------------+

       See <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/babeltrace2-intro.7.html">babeltrace2-intro(7)</a> to learn more about the Babeltrace 2
       project and its core concepts.

       The purpose of a <b>sink.text.details </b>component is to always print
       the same text for the same sequence of consumed messages,
       whatever the build configuration of the Babeltrace 2 project.
       This can be helpful for testing, debugging, and support.

       The output format is optimized for human reading, with colors
       when the terminal supports it. You can control how the component
       prints color codes with the <b>color </b>parameter.

       To achieve a reproducible output, a <b>sink.text.details </b>component
       sorts the members of all unordered sets before it prints them.
       For example, the component sorts enumeration field class mappings
       by label and, for each mapping, sorts the contained ranges.

       In normal mode, each message has at least three lines, the three
       first being:

        1. Timing information (cycles and nanoseconds since origin).

           Example:

               [102,423,274,041,829 cycles, 1,441,852,841,550,867,846 ns from origin]

        2. Unique stream identifier.

           To be able to follow a specific trace object (the name and
           UUID properties of a trace object are optional), the
           component assigns a unique numeric ID to the trace object
           when it first encounters it in a stream beginning message.

           Example:

               {Trace 1, Stream class ID 0, Stream ID 2}

        3. Message type and basic information.

           Examples:

               Packet beginning:

               Event `lttng_ust_statedump:build_id` (Class ID 2):

       What follows depend on the specific message type. The component
       prints all the available properties and fields in a
       human-readable, structured format.

       When a <b>sink.text.details </b>component consumes a stream beginning or
       an event message, it can print a metadata block for all the
       metadata objects which it did not print yet. You can use the
       <b>with-metadata </b>parameter to disable this.

       You can hide specific properties with the <b>with-stream-class-name</b>,
       <b>with-stream-name</b>, <b>with-time</b>, <b>with-trace-name</b>, and <b>with-uuid</b>
       parameters.

       To make the component hide many message details and print a
       single message per line, you can enable the compact mode with the
       <b>compact </b>parameter.
