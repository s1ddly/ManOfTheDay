       This manual page documents briefly the <b>rtmon </b>command.

       <b>rtmon </b>listens on <i>netlink</i> socket and monitors routing table
       changes.

       <i>rtmon</i> can be started before the first network configuration
       command is issued.  For example if you insert:

       <b>rtmon file /var/log/rtmon.log</b>

       in a startup script, you will be able to view the full history
       later.  Certainly, it is possible to start rtmon at any time. It
       prepends the history with the state snapshot dumped at the moment
       of starting.
