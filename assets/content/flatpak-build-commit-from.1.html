<pre>
       Creates new commits on the DST-REF branch in the DST-REPO, with
       the contents (and most of the metadata) taken from another
       branch, either from another repo, or from another branch in the
       same repository.

       The collection ID set on DST-REPO (if set) will be used for the
       newly created commits.

       This command is very useful when you want to maintain a branch
       with a clean history that has no unsigned or broken commits. For
       instance, you can import the head from a different repository
       from an automatic builder when you've verified that it worked.
       The new commit will have no parents or signatures from the
       autobuilder, and can be properly signed with the official key.

       Any deltas that affect the original commit and that match parent
       commits in the destination repository are copied and rewritten
       for the new commit id.
