       This command creates an empty Git repository - basically a <b>.git</b>
       directory with subdirectories for <b>objects</b>, <b>refs/heads</b>, <b>refs/tags</b>,
       and template files. An initial branch without any commits will be
       created (see the <b>--initial-branch </b>option below for its name).

       If the <b>$GIT_DIR </b>environment variable is set then it specifies a
       path to use instead of <b>./.git </b>for the base of the repository.

       If the object storage directory is specified via the
       <b>$GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY </b>environment variable then the sha1
       directories are created underneath - otherwise the default
       <b>$GIT_DIR/objects </b>directory is used.

       Running <i>git init</i> in an existing repository is safe. It will not
       overwrite things that are already there. The primary reason for
       rerunning <i>git init</i> is to pick up newly added templates (or to
       move the repository to another place if --separate-git-dir is
       given).
