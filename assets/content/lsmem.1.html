       The <b>lsmem </b>command lists the ranges of available memory with their
       online status. The listed memory blocks correspond to the memory
       block representation in sysfs. The command also shows the memory
       block size and the amount of memory in online and offline state.

       The default output compatible with original implementation from
       s390-tools, but itâ€™s strongly recommended to avoid using default
       outputs in your scripts. Always explicitly define expected
       columns by using the <b>--output </b>option together with a columns list
       in environments where a stable output is required.

       The <b>lsmem </b>command lists a new memory range always when the
       current memory block distinguish from the previous block by some
       output column. This default behavior is possible to override by
       the <b>--split </b>option (e.g., <b>lsmem --split=ZONES</b>). The special word
       "none" may be used to ignore all differences between memory
       blocks and to create as large as possible continuous ranges. The
       opposite semantic is <b>--all </b>to list individual memory blocks.

       Note that some output columns may provide inaccurate information
       if a split policy forces <b>lsmem </b>to ignore differences in some
       attributes. For example if you merge removable and non-removable
       memory blocks to the one range than all the range will be marked
       as non-removable on <b>lsmem </b>output.

       Not all columns are supported on all systems. If an unsupported
       column is specified, <b>lsmem </b>prints the column but does not provide
       any data for it.

       Use the <b>--help </b>option to see the columns description.
