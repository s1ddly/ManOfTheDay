       GNU <i>soelim</i> is a preprocessor for the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/groff.7.html">groff(7)</a> document formatting
       system.  <i>soelim</i> works as a filter to eliminate source requests in
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/roff.7.html">roff(7)</a> input files; that is, it replaces lines of the form “<b>.so</b>
       <i>macro-file</i>” within each text <i>input-file</i> with the contents of
       <i>macro-file</i>, recursively.  By default, it writes <b>.lf </b>requests as
       well to record the name and line number of each <i>input-file</i> and
       <i>macro-file</i>, so that any diagnostics produced by later processing
       can be accurately traced to the original input.  Options allow
       this information to be suppressed (<b>-r</b>) or supplied in TeX
       comments instead (<b>-t</b>).  In the absence of <i>input-file</i> arguments,
       <i>soelim</i> reads the standard input stream.  Output is written to the
       standard output stream.

       To embed a backslash “<b>\</b>” in the name of a <i>macro-file</i>, write “<b>\\</b>”
       or “<b>\e</b>”.  To embed a space, write “<b>\ </b>” (backslash followed by a
       space).  Any other escape sequence in <i>macro-file</i>, including
       “<b>\[rs]</b>”, prevents <i>soelim</i> from replacing the source request.

       The dot must be at the beginning of a line and must be followed
       by “<b>so</b>” without intervening spaces or tabs for <i>soelim</i> to handle
       it.  This convention allows source requests to be “protected”
       from processing by <i>soelim</i>, for instance as part of macro
       definitions or <b>.if </b>requests.

       There must also be at least one space between “<b>so</b>” and its <i>macro-</i>
       <i>file</i> argument.  The <b>-C </b>option overrides this requirement.

       The foregoing is the limit of <i>soelim</i>'s understanding of <i>roff</i>
       languages; it does not, for example, replace the input line
              .if 1 .so otherfile
       with the contents of <i>otherfile</i>.  With its <b>-r </b>option, therefore,
       <i>soelim</i> can be used to process text files in general, to flatten a
       tree of input documents.

       <i>soelim</i> was designed to handle situations where the target of a
       <i>roff</i> source request requires a preprocessor such as <i>eqn</i>(1),
       <i>pic</i>(1), <i>refer</i>(1), or <i>tbl</i>(1).  The usual processing sequence of
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/groff.1.html">groff(1)</a> is as follows.

                 input        sourced
                 file          file
                   ⎪             ⎪
                   ↓             ↓
               preprocessor ⎯→ troff ⎯→ postprocessor
                                             ⎪
                                             ↓
                                          output
                                           file

       That is, files sourced with <b>.so </b>are normally read <i>only</i> by <i>troff</i>
       (the actual formatter).  <i>soelim</i> is <i>not</i> required for <i>troff</i> to
       source files.

       If a file to be sourced should also be preprocessed, it must
       already be read <i>before</i> the input file passes through the
       preprocessor.  <i>soelim</i>, normally invoked via <i>groff</i>'s <b>-s </b>option,
       handles this.
