       The trace-cmd(1) stat displays the various status of the tracing
       (ftrace) system. The status that it shows is:

       <b>Instances: </b>List all configured ftrace instances.

       <b>Tracer: </b>if one of the tracers (like function_graph) is active.
       Otherwise nothing is displayed.

       <b>Events: </b>Lists the events that are enable.

       <b>Event filters: </b>Shows any filters that are set for any events

       <b>Function filters: </b>Shows any filters for the function tracers

       <b>Graph functions: </b>Shows any functions that the function graph
       tracer should graph

       <b>Buffers: </b>Shows the trace buffer size if they have been expanded.
       By default, tracing buffers are in a compressed format until they
       are used. If they are compressed, the buffer display will not be
       shown.

       <b>Trace clock: </b>If the tracing clock is anything other than the
       default "local" it will be displayed.

       <b>Trace CPU mask: </b>If not all available CPUs are in the tracing CPU
       mask, then the tracing CPU mask will be displayed.

       <b>Trace max latency: </b>Shows the value of the trace max latency if it
       is other than zero.

       <b>Kprobes: </b>Shows any kprobes that are defined for tracing.

       <b>Uprobes: </b>Shows any uprobes that are defined for tracing.

       <b>Error log: </b>Dump the content of ftrace error_log file.
