       <b>ltrace </b>is a program that simply runs the specified <i>command</i> until
       it exits.  It intercepts and records the dynamic library calls
       which are called by the executed process and the signals which
       are received by that process.  It can also intercept and print
       the system calls executed by the program.

       Its use is very similar to <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/strace.1.html">strace(1)</a>.

       <b>ltrace </b>shows parameters of invoked functions and system calls.
       To determine what arguments each function has, it needs external
       declaration of function prototypes.  Those are stored in files
       called <i>prototype libraries</i>--see ltrace.conf(5) for details on the
       syntax of these files.  See the section <b>PROTOTYPE LIBRARY</b>
       <b>DISCOVERY </b>to learn how <b>ltrace </b>finds prototype libraries.
