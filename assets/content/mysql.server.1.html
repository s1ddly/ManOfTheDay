       MariaDB distributions on Unix include a script named
       <b>mysql.server</b>. It can be used on systems such as Linux and Solaris
       that use System V-style run directories to start and stop system
       services. It is also used by the Mac OS X Startup Item for
       MariaDB.

       <b>mysql.server </b>can be found in the support-files directory under
       your MariaDB installation directory or in a MariaDB source
       distribution.

       If you use the Linux server RPM package
       (MySQL-server-<i>VERSION</i>.rpm), the <b>mysql.server </b>script will be
       installed in the /etc/init.d directory with the name mysql. You
       need not install it manually.

       Some vendors provide RPM packages that install a startup script
       under a different name such as <b>mysqld</b>.

       If you install MariaDB from a source distribution or using a
       binary distribution format that does not install <b>mysql.server</b>
       automatically, you can install it manually.

       <b>mysql.server </b>reads options from the [mysql.server] and [mysqld]
       sections of option files. For backward compatibility, it also
       reads [mysql_server] sections, although you should rename such
       sections to [mysql.server]&amp;.

       <b>mysql.server </b>supports the following options.

       •   <b>--basedir=</b><i>path</i>

           The path to the MariaDB installation directory.

       •   <b>--datadir=</b><i>path</i>

           The path to the MariaDB data directory.

       •   <b>--pid-file=</b><i>file_name</i>

           The path name of the file in which the server should write
           its process ID. If not provided, the default, "host_name.pid"
           is used.

       •   <b>--service-startup-timeout=</b><i>file_name</i>

           How long in seconds to wait for confirmation of server
           startup. If the server does not start within this time,
           <b>mysql.server </b>exits with an error. The default value is 900. A
           value of 0 means not to wait at all for startup. Negative
           values mean to wait forever (no timeout).

       •   <b>--use-mysqld_safe</b>

           Use <b>mysqld_safe </b>to start the server. This is the default.

       •   <b>--use-manager</b>

           Use Instance Manager to start the server.

       •   <b>--user=</b><i>user_name</i>

           The login user name to use for running <b>mysqld</b>.
