       systemd-boot-system-token.service is a system service that
       automatically generates a 'system token' to store in an EFI
       variable in the system's NVRAM and a random seed to store on the
       EFI System Partition ESP on disk. The boot loader may then
       combine these two randomized data fields by cryptographic
       hashing, and pass it to the OS it boots as initialization seed
       for its entropy pool. The random seed stored in the ESP is
       refreshed on each reboot ensuring that multiple subsequent boots
       will boot with different seeds. The 'system token' is generated
       randomly once, and then persistently stored in the system's EFI
       variable storage.

       The systemd-boot-system-token.service unit invokes the <b>bootctl</b>
       <b>random-seed </b>command, which updates the random seed in the ESP,
       and initializes the 'system token' if it's not initialized yet.
       The service is conditionalized so that it is run only when all of
       the below apply:

       •   A boot loader is used that implements the <b>Boot Loader</b>
           <b>Interface</b><b></b>[1] (which defines the 'system token' concept).

       •   Either a 'system token' was not set yet, or the boot loader
           has not passed the OS a random seed yet (and thus most likely
           has been missing the random seed file in the ESP).

       •   The system is not running in a VM environment. This case is
           explicitly excluded since on VM environments the ESP backing
           storage and EFI variable storage is typically not physically
           separated and hence booting the same OS image in multiple
           instances would replicate both, thus reusing the same random
           seed and 'system token' among all instances, which defeats
           its purpose. Note that it's still possible to use boot loader
           random seed provisioning in this mode, but the automatic
           logic implemented by this service has no effect then, and the
           user instead has to manually invoke the <b>bootctl random-seed</b>
           acknowledging these restrictions.

       service invokes.
