       <b>btrfs scrub </b>is used to scrub a mounted btrfs filesystem, which
       will read all data and metadata blocks from all devices and
       verify checksums. Automatically repair corrupted blocks if
       there’s a correct copy available.

           <b>Note</b>
           Scrub is not a filesystem checker (fsck) and does not verify
           nor repair structural damage in the filesystem. It really
           only checks checksums of data and tree blocks, it doesn’t
           ensure the content of tree blocks is valid and consistent.
           There’s some validation performed when metadata blocks are
           read from disk but it’s not extensive and cannot substitute
           full <i>btrfs check</i> run.

       The user is supposed to run it manually or via a periodic system
       service. The recommended period is a month but could be less. The
       estimated device bandwidth utilization is about 80% on an idle
       filesystem. The IO priority class is by default <i>idle</i> so
       background scrub should not significantly interfere with normal
       filesystem operation. The IO scheduler set for the device(s)
       might not support the priority classes though.

       The scrubbing status is recorded in <i>/var/lib/btrfs/</i> in textual
       files named <i>scrub.status.UUID</i> for a filesystem identified by the
       given UUID. (Progress state is communicated through a named pipe
       in file <i>scrub.progress.UUID</i> in the same directory.) The status
       file is updated every 5 seconds. A resumed scrub will continue
       from the last saved position.

       Scrub can be started only on a mounted filesystem, though it’s
       possible to scrub only a selected device. See <b>scrub start </b>for
       more.
