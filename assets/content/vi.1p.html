       This utility shall be provided on systems that both support the
       User Portability Utilities option and define the POSIX2_CHAR_TERM
       symbol.  On other systems it is optional.

       The <i>vi</i> (visual) utility is a screen-oriented text editor. Only
       the open and visual modes of the editor are described in
       POSIX.1‐2008; see the line editor <i>ex</i> for additional editing
       capabilities used in <i>vi</i>.  The user can switch back and forth
       between <i>vi</i> and <i>ex</i> and execute <i>ex</i> commands from within <i>vi</i>.

       This reference page uses the term <i>edit buffer</i> to describe the
       current working text. No specific implementation is implied by
       this term. All editing changes are performed on the edit buffer,
       and no changes to it shall affect any file until an editor
       command writes the file.

       When using <i>vi</i>, the terminal screen acts as a window into the
       editing buffer. Changes made to the editing buffer shall be
       reflected in the screen display; the position of the cursor on
       the screen shall indicate the position within the editing buffer.

       Certain terminals do not have all the capabilities necessary to
       support the complete <i>vi</i> definition. When these commands cannot be
       supported on such terminals, this condition shall not produce an
       error message such as ``not an editor command'' or report a
       syntax error. The implementation may either accept the commands
       and produce results on the screen that are the result of an
       unsuccessful attempt to meet the requirements of this volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017 or report an error describing the terminal-related
       deficiency.
