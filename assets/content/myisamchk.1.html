       The <b>myisamchk </b>utility gets information about your database tables
       or checks, repairs, or optimizes them.  <b>myisamchk </b>works with
       MyISAM tables (tables that have .MYD and .MYI files for storing
       data and indexes).

       The use of <b>myisamchk </b>with partitioned tables is not supported.

           <b>Caution</b>
           It is best to make a backup of a table before performing a
           table repair operation; under some circumstances the
           operation might cause data loss. Possible causes include but
           are not limited to file system errors.

       Invoke <b>myisamchk </b>like this:

           shell&gt; <b>myisamchk [</b><i>options</i><b>] </b><i>tbl_name</i> <b>...</b>

       The <i>options</i> specify what you want <b>myisamchk </b>to do. They are
       described in the following sections. You can also get a list of
       options by invoking <b>myisamchk --help</b>.

       With no options, <b>myisamchk </b>simply checks your table as the
       default operation. To get more information or to tell <b>myisamchk</b>
       to take corrective action, specify options as described in the
       following discussion.

       <i>tbl_name</i> is the database table you want to check or repair. If
       you run <b>myisamchk </b>somewhere other than in the database directory,
       you must specify the path to the database directory, because
       <b>myisamchk </b>has no idea where the database is located. In fact,
       <b>myisamchk </b>does not actually care whether the files you are
       working on are located in a database directory. You can copy the
       files that correspond to a database table into some other
       location and perform recovery operations on them there.

       You can name several tables on the <b>myisamchk </b>command line if you
       wish. You can also specify a table by naming its index file (the
       file with the .MYI suffix). This allows you to specify all tables
       in a directory by using the pattern *.MYI. For example, if you
       are in a database directory, you can check all the MyISAM tables
       in that directory like this:

           shell&gt; <b>myisamchk *.MYI</b>

       If you are not in the database directory, you can check all the
       tables there by specifying the path to the directory:

           shell&gt; <b>myisamchk </b><i>/path/to/database_dir/</i><b>*.MYI</b>

       You can even check all tables in all databases by specifying a
       wildcard with the path to the MariaDB data directory:

           shell&gt; <b>myisamchk </b><i>/path/to/datadir/*/*</i><b>.MYI</b>

       The recommended way to quickly check all MyISAM tables is:

           shell&gt; <b>myisamchk --silent --fast </b><i>/path/to/datadir/*/*</i><b>.MYI</b>

       If you want to check all MyISAM tables and repair any that are
       corrupted, you can use the following command:

           shell&gt; <b>myisamchk --silent --force --fast --update-state \</b>
                     <b>--key_buffer_size=64M --sort_buffer_size=64M \</b>
                     <b>--read_buffer_size=1M --write_buffer_size=1M \</b>
                     <i>/path/to/datadir/*/*</i><b>.MYI</b>

       This command assumes that you have more than 64MB free. For more
       information about memory allocation with <b>myisamchk</b>, see the
       section called “MYISAMCHK MEMORY USAGE”.

           <b>Important</b>
           <i>You must ensure that no other program is using the tables</i>
           <i>while you are running</i> <b>myisamchk</b>. The most effective means of
           doing so is to shut down the MariaDB server while running
           <b>myisamchk</b>, or to lock all tables that <b>myisamchk </b>is being used
           on.

           Otherwise, when you run <b>myisamchk</b>, it may display the
           following error message:

               warning: clients are using or haven´t closed the table properly

           This means that you are trying to check a table that has been
           updated by another program (such as the <b>mysqld </b>server) that
           hasn´t yet closed the file or that has died without closing
           the file properly, which can sometimes lead to the corruption
           of one or more MyISAM tables.

           If <b>mysqld </b>is running, you must force it to flush any table
           modifications that are still buffered in memory by using
           FLUSH TABLES. You should then ensure that no one is using the
           tables while you are running <b>myisamchk</b>

           However, the easiest way to avoid this problem is to use
           CHECK TABLE instead of <b>myisamchk </b>to check tables.

       <b>myisamchk </b>supports the following options, which can be specified
       on the command line or in the [myisamchk] option file group.
