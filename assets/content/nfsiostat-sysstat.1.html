       The <b>nfsiostat-sysstat </b>command displays statistics about read and
       write operations on NFS filesystems.

       The <i>interval</i> parameter specifies the amount of time in seconds
       between each report. The first report contains statistics for the
       time since system startup (boot). Each subsequent report contains
       statistics collected during the interval since the previous
       report.  A report consists of an NFS header row followed by a
       line of statistics for each network filesystem that is mounted.
       The <i>count</i> parameter can be specified in conjunction with the
       <i>interval</i> parameter. If the <i>count</i> parameter is specified, the
       value of <i>count</i> determines the number of reports generated at
       <i>interval</i> seconds apart. If the <i>interval</i> parameter is specified
       without the <i>count</i> parameter, the <b>nfsiostat-sysstat </b>command
       generates reports continuously.
