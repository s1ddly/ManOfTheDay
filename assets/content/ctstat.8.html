       This manual page documents briefly the <b>lnstat </b>command.

       <b>lnstat </b>is a generalized and more feature-complete replacement for
       the old rtstat program. It is commonly used to periodically print
       a selection of statistical values exported by the kernel.  In
       addition to routing cache statistics, it supports any kind of
       statistics the linux kernel exports via a file in
       /proc/net/stat/.

       Each file in /proc/net/stat/ contains a header line listing the
       column names.  These names are used by <b>lnstat </b>as keys for
       selecting which statistics to print. For every CPU present in the
       system, a line follows which lists the actual values for each
       column of the file. <b>lnstat </b>sums these values up (which in fact
       are counters) before printing them. After each interval, only the
       difference to the last value is printed.

       Files and columns may be selected by using the <b>-f </b>and <b>-k</b>
       parameters. By default, all columns of all files are printed.
