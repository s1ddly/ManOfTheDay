       <b>login </b>is used when signing onto a system. If no argument is
       given, <b>login </b>prompts for the username.

       The user is then prompted for a password, where appropriate.
       Echoing is disabled to prevent revealing the password. Only a
       number of password failures are permitted before <b>login </b>exits and
       the communications link is severed. See <b>LOGIN_RETRIES </b>in CONFIG
       FILE ITEMS section.

       If password aging has been enabled for the account, the user may
       be prompted for a new password before proceeding. In such case
       old password must be provided and the new password entered before
       continuing. Please refer to <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/passwd.1.html">passwd(1)</a> for more information.

       The user and group ID will be set according to their values in
       the <i>/etc/passwd</i> file. There is one exception if the user ID is
       zero. In this case, only the primary group ID of the account is
       set. This should allow the system administrator to login even in
       case of network problems. The environment variable values for
       <b>$HOME</b>, <b>$USER</b>, <b>$SHELL</b>, <b>$PATH</b>, <b>$LOGNAME</b>, and <b>$MAIL </b>are set
       according to the appropriate fields in the password entry. <b>$PATH</b>
       defaults to <i>/usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin</i> for normal users, and to
       <i>/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin</i> for
       root, if not otherwise configured.

       The environment variable <b>$TERM </b>will be preserved, if it exists,
       else it will be initialized to the terminal type on your tty.
       Other environment variables are preserved if the <b>-p </b>option is
       given.

       Then the userâ€™s shell is started. If no shell is specified for
       the user in <i>/etc/passwd</i>, then <i>/bin/sh</i> is used. If there is no
       home directory specified in <i>/etc/passwd</i>, then <i>/</i> is used, followed
       by <i>.hushlogin</i> check as described below.

       If the file <i>.hushlogin</i> exists, then a "quiet" login is performed.
       This disables the checking of mail and the printing of the last
       login time and message of the day. Otherwise, if <i>/var/log/lastlog</i>
       exists, the last login time is printed, and the current login is
       recorded.
