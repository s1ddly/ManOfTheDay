       <b>pmdabcc </b>is a Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) Performance Metrics
       Domain Agent (PMDA) which extracts live performance data from
       extended BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) in-kernel programs by using
       BCC (BPF Compiler Collection) Python frontend.

       <b>pmdabcc </b>loads and acts as a bridge for any number of configured,
       separate PCP BCC PMDA Python modules running BPF programs.
       Existing BCC Python tools and programs should be possible to be
       utilized with PCP BCC PMDA modules with reasonable effort.

       See the BPF and BCC documentation for detailed description of
       both.
