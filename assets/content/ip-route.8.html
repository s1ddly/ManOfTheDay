<pre>
       <b>ip route </b>is used to manipulate entries in the kernel routing
       tables.

       <b>Route types:</b>

               <b>unicast </b>- the route entry describes real paths to the
               destinations covered by the route prefix.

               <b>unreachable </b>- these destinations are unreachable. Packets
               are discarded and the ICMP message <i>host unreachable</i> is
               generated.  The local senders get an <i>EHOSTUNREACH</i> error.

               <b>blackhole </b>- these destinations are unreachable. Packets
               are discarded silently.  The local senders get an <i>EINVAL</i>
               error.

               <b>prohibit </b>- these destinations are unreachable. Packets
               are discarded and the ICMP message <i>communication</i>
               <i>administratively prohibited</i> is generated. The local
               senders get an <i>EACCES</i> error.

               <b>local </b>- the destinations are assigned to this host. The
               packets are looped back and delivered locally.

               <b>broadcast </b>- the destinations are broadcast addresses. The
               packets are sent as link broadcasts.

               <b>throw </b>- a special control route used together with policy
               rules. If such a route is selected, lookup in this table
               is terminated pretending that no route was found. Without
               policy routing it is equivalent to the absence of the
               route in the routing table. The packets are dropped and
               the ICMP message <i>net unreachable</i> is generated. The local
               senders get an <i>ENETUNREACH</i> error.

               <b>nat </b>- a special NAT route. Destinations covered by the
               prefix are considered to be dummy (or external) addresses
               which require translation to real (or internal) ones
               before forwarding. The addresses to translate to are
               selected with the attribute <b>via</b>.  <b>Warning: </b>Route NAT is
               no longer supported in Linux 2.6.

               <b>anycast </b>- <i>not implemented</i> the destinations are <i>anycast</i>
               addresses assigned to this host. They are mainly
               equivalent to <b>local </b>with one difference: such addresses
               are invalid when used as the source address of any
               packet.

               <b>multicast </b>- a special type used for multicast routing. It
               is not present in normal routing tables.

       <b>Route tables: </b>Linux-2.x can pack routes into several routing
       tables identified by a number in the range from 1 to 2^32-1 or by
       name from the file <b>/etc/iproute2/rt_tables </b>By default all normal
       routes are inserted into the <b>main </b>table (ID 254) and the kernel
       only uses this table when calculating routes.  Values (0, 253,
       254, and 255) are reserved for built-in use.

       Actually, one other table always exists, which is invisible but
       even more important. It is the <b>local </b>table (ID 255). This table
       consists of routes for local and broadcast addresses. The kernel
       maintains this table automatically and the administrator usually
       need not modify it or even look at it.

       The multiple routing tables enter the game when <i>policy routing</i> is
       used.

       ip route add
              add new route

       ip route change
              change route

       ip route replace
              change or add new one

              <b>to </b><i>TYPE PREFIX</i> <b>(default)</b>
                     the destination prefix of the route. If <i>TYPE</i> is
                     omitted, <b>ip </b>assumes type <b>unicast</b>.  Other values of
                     <i>TYPE</i> are listed above.  <i>PREFIX</i> is an IP or IPv6
                     address optionally followed by a slash and the
                     prefix length. If the length of the prefix is
                     missing, <b>ip </b>assumes a full-length host route. There
                     is also a special <i>PREFIX</i> <b>default </b>- which is
                     equivalent to IP <b>0/0 </b>or to IPv6 <b>::/0</b>.

              <b>tos </b><i>TOS</i>

              <b>dsfield </b><i>TOS</i>
                     the Type Of Service (TOS) key. This key has no
                     associated mask and the longest match is understood
                     as: First, compare the TOS of the route and of the
                     packet. If they are not equal, then the packet may
                     still match a route with a zero TOS.  <i>TOS</i> is either
                     an 8 bit hexadecimal number or an identifier from
                     <b>/etc/iproute2/rt_dsfield</b>.

              <b>metric </b><i>NUMBER</i>

              <b>preference </b><i>NUMBER</i>
                     the preference value of the route.  <i>NUMBER</i> is an
                     arbitrary 32bit number, where routes with lower
                     values are preferred.

              <b>table </b><i>TABLEID</i>
                     the table to add this route to.  <i>TABLEID</i> may be a
                     number or a string from the file
                     <b>/etc/iproute2/rt_tables</b>.  If this parameter is
                     omitted, <b>ip </b>assumes the <b>main </b>table, with the
                     exception of <b>local</b>, <b>broadcast </b>and <b>nat </b>routes, which
                     are put into the <b>local </b>table by default.

              <b>vrf </b><i>NAME</i>
                     the vrf name to add this route to. Implicitly means
                     the table associated with the VRF.

              <b>dev </b><i>NAME</i>
                     the output device name.

              <b>via </b><i>[ FAMILY ] ADDRESS</i>
                     the address of the nexthop router, in the address
                     family FAMILY.  Actually, the sense of this field
                     depends on the route type.  For normal <b>unicast</b>
                     routes it is either the true next hop router or, if
                     it is a direct route installed in BSD compatibility
                     mode, it can be a local address of the interface.
                     For NAT routes it is the first address of the block
                     of translated IP destinations.

              <b>src </b><i>ADDRESS</i>
                     the source address to prefer when sending to the
                     destinations covered by the route prefix.

              <b>realm </b><i>REALMID</i>
                     the realm to which this route is assigned.  <i>REALMID</i>
                     may be a number or a string from the file
                     <b>/etc/iproute2/rt_realms</b>.

              <b>mtu </b><i>MTU</i>

              <b>mtu lock </b><i>MTU</i>
                     the MTU along the path to the destination. If the
                     modifier <b>lock </b>is not used, the MTU may be updated
                     by the kernel due to Path MTU Discovery. If the
                     modifier <b>lock </b>is used, no path MTU discovery will
                     be tried, all packets will be sent without the DF
                     bit in IPv4 case or fragmented to MTU for IPv6.

              <b>window </b><i>NUMBER</i>
                     the maximal window for TCP to advertise to these
                     destinations, measured in bytes. It limits maximal
                     data bursts that our TCP peers are allowed to send
                     to us.

              <b>rtt </b><i>TIME</i>
                     the initial RTT ('Round Trip Time') estimate. If no
                     suffix is specified the units are raw values passed
                     directly to the routing code to maintain
                     compatibility with previous releases.  Otherwise if
                     a suffix of s, sec or secs is used to specify
                     seconds and ms, msec or msecs to specify
                     milliseconds.

              <b>rttvar </b><i>TIME</i> <b>(Linux 2.3.15+ only)</b>
                     the initial RTT variance estimate. Values are
                     specified as with <b>rtt </b>above.

              <b>rto_min </b><i>TIME</i> <b>(Linux 2.6.23+ only)</b>
                     the minimum TCP Retransmission TimeOut to use when
                     communicating with this destination. Values are
                     specified as with <b>rtt </b>above.

              <b>ssthresh </b><i>NUMBER</i> <b>(Linux 2.3.15+ only)</b>
                     an estimate for the initial slow start threshold.

              <b>cwnd </b><i>NUMBER</i> <b>(Linux 2.3.15+ only)</b>
                     the clamp for congestion window. It is ignored if
                     the <b>lock </b>flag is not used.

              <b>initcwnd </b><i>NUMBER</i> <b>(Linux 2.5.70+ only)</b>
                     the initial congestion window size for connections
                     to this destination.  Actual window size is this
                     value multiplied by the MSS (``Maximal Segment
                     Size'') for same connection. The default is zero,
                     meaning to use the values specified in RFC2414.

              <b>initrwnd </b><i>NUMBER</i> <b>(Linux 2.6.33+ only)</b>
                     the initial receive window size for connections to
                     this destination.  Actual window size is this value
                     multiplied by the MSS of the connection.  The
                     default value is zero, meaning to use Slow Start
                     value.

              <b>features </b><i>FEATURES</i> <b>(Linux</b><i>3.18+</i><b>only)</b>
                     Enable or disable per-route features. Only
                     available feature at this time is <b>ecn </b>to enable
                     explicit congestion notification when initiating
                     connections to the given destination network.  When
                     responding to a connection request from the given
                     network, ecn will also be used even if the
                     <b>net.ipv4.tcp_ecn </b>sysctl is set to 0.

              <b>quickack </b><i>BOOL</i> <b>(Linux 3.11+ only)</b>
                     Enable or disable quick ack for connections to this
                     destination.

              <b>fastopen_no_cookie </b><i>BOOL</i> <b>(Linux 4.15+ only)</b>
                     Enable TCP Fastopen without a cookie for
                     connections to this destination.

              <b>congctl </b><i>NAME</i> <b>(Linux 3.20+ only)</b>

              <b>congctl lock </b><i>NAME</i> <b>(Linux 3.20+ only)</b>
                     Sets a specific TCP congestion control algorithm
                     only for a given destination.  If not specified,
                     Linux keeps the current global default TCP
                     congestion control algorithm, or the one set from
                     the application. If the modifier <b>lock </b>is not used,
                     an application may nevertheless overwrite the
                     suggested congestion control algorithm for that
                     destination. If the modifier <b>lock </b>is used, then an
                     application is not allowed to overwrite the
                     specified congestion control algorithm for that
                     destination, thus it will be enforced/guaranteed to
                     use the proposed algorithm.

              <b>advmss </b><i>NUMBER</i> <b>(Linux 2.3.15+ only)</b>
                     the MSS ('Maximal Segment Size') to advertise to
                     these destinations when establishing TCP
                     connections. If it is not given, Linux uses a
                     default value calculated from the first hop device
                     MTU.  (If the path to these destination is
                     asymmetric, this guess may be wrong.)

              <b>reordering </b><i>NUMBER</i> <b>(Linux 2.3.15+ only)</b>
                     Maximal reordering on the path to this destination.
                     If it is not given, Linux uses the value selected
                     with <b>sysctl </b>variable <b>net/ipv4/tcp_reordering</b>.

              <b>nexthop </b><i>NEXTHOP</i>
                     the nexthop of a multipath route.  <i>NEXTHOP</i> is a
                     complex value with its own syntax similar to the
                     top level argument lists:

                             <b>via </b><i>[ FAMILY ] ADDRESS</i> - is the nexthop
                             router.

                             <b>dev </b><i>NAME</i> - is the output device.

                             <b>weight </b><i>NUMBER</i> - is a weight for this
                             element of a multipath route reflecting its
                             relative bandwidth or quality.

                     The internal buffer used in iproute2 limits the
                     maximum number of nexthops that may be specified in
                     one go. If only <i>ADDRESS</i> is given, the current
                     buffer size allows for 144 IPv6 nexthops and 253
                     IPv4 ones. For IPv4, this effectively limits the
                     number of nexthops possible per route. With IPv6,
                     further nexthops may be appended to the same route
                     via <b>ip route append </b>command.

              <b>scope </b><i>SCOPE_VAL</i>
                     the scope of the destinations covered by the route
                     prefix.  <i>SCOPE_VAL</i> may be a number or a string from
                     the file <b>/etc/iproute2/rt_scopes</b>.  If this
                     parameter is omitted, <b>ip </b>assumes scope <b>global </b>for
                     all gatewayed <b>unicast </b>routes, scope <b>link </b>for direct
                     <b>unicast </b>and <b>broadcast </b>routes and scope <b>host </b>for
                     <b>local </b>routes.

              <b>protocol </b><i>RTPROTO</i>
                     the routing protocol identifier of this route.
                     <i>RTPROTO</i> may be a number or a string from the file
                     <b>/etc/iproute2/rt_protos</b>.  If the routing protocol
                     ID is not given, <b>ip assumes protocol boot </b>(i.e. it
                     assumes the route was added by someone who doesn't
                     understand what they are doing). Several protocol
                     values have a fixed interpretation.  Namely:

                             <b>redirect </b>- the route was installed due to
                             an ICMP redirect.

                             <b>kernel </b>- the route was installed by the
                             kernel during autoconfiguration.

                             <b>boot </b>- the route was installed during the
                             bootup sequence.  If a routing daemon
                             starts, it will purge all of them.

                             <b>static </b>- the route was installed by the
                             administrator to override dynamic routing.
                             Routing daemon will respect them and,
                             probably, even advertise them to its peers.

                             <b>ra </b>- the route was installed by Router
                             Discovery protocol.

                     The rest of the values are not reserved and the
                     administrator is free to assign (or not to assign)
                     protocol tags.

              <b>onlink </b>pretend that the nexthop is directly attached to
                     this link, even if it does not match any interface
                     prefix.

              <b>pref </b><i>PREF</i>
                     the IPv6 route preference.  <i>PREF</i> is a string
                     specifying the route preference as defined in
                     RFC4191 for Router Discovery messages. Namely:

                             <b>low </b>- the route has a lowest priority

                             <b>medium </b>- the route has a default priority

                             <b>high </b>- the route has a highest priority

              <b>nhid </b><i>ID</i>
                     use nexthop object with given id as nexthop
                     specification.

              <b>encap </b><i>ENCAPTYPE ENCAPHDR</i>
                     attach tunnel encapsulation attributes to this
                     route.

                                 as described in <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ip-sr.8.html">ip-sr(8)</a>.

              <b>expires </b><i>TIME</i> <b>(Linux 4.4+ only)</b>

              <b>ttl-propagate </b>{ <b>enabled </b>| <b>disabled </b>}
                     Control whether TTL should be propagated from any
                     encap into the un-encapsulated packet, overriding
                     any global configuration. Only supported for MPLS
                     at present.

       ip route delete
              delete route
              <b>ip route del </b>has the same arguments as <b>ip route add</b>, but
              their semantics are a bit different.

              Key values (<b>to</b>, <b>tos</b>, <b>preference </b>and <b>table</b>) select the
              route to delete. If optional attributes are present, <b>ip</b>
              verifies that they coincide with the attributes of the
              route to delete.  If no route with the given key and
              attributes was found, <b>ip route del </b>fails.

       ip route show
              list routes
              the command displays the contents of the routing tables or
              the route(s) selected by some criteria.

              <b>to </b><i>SELECTOR</i> <b>(default)</b>
                     only select routes from the given range of
                     destinations.  <i>SELECTOR</i> consists of an optional
                     modifier (<b>root</b>, <b>match </b>or <b>exact</b>) and a prefix.  <b>root</b>
                     <i>PREFIX</i> selects routes with prefixes not shorter
                     than <i>PREFIX</i>.  F.e.  <b>root </b><i>0/0</i> selects the entire
                     routing table.  <b>match </b><i>PREFIX</i> selects routes with
                     prefixes not longer than <i>PREFIX</i>.  F.e.  <b>match</b>
                     <i>10.0/16</i> selects <i>10.0/16</i>, <i>10/8</i> and <i>0/0</i>, but it does
                     not select <i>10.1/16</i> and <i>10.0.0/24</i>.  And <b>exact </b><i>PREFIX</i>
                     (or just <i>PREFIX</i>) selects routes with this exact
                     prefix. If neither of these options are present, <b>ip</b>
                     assumes <b>root </b><i>0/0</i> i.e. it lists the entire table.

              <b>tos </b><i>TOS</i>

              <b>dsfield </b><i>TOS</i>
                     only select routes with the given TOS.

              <b>table </b><i>TABLEID</i>
                     show the routes from this table(s). The default
                     setting is to show table <b>main</b>.  <i>TABLEID</i> may either
                     be the ID of a real table or one of the special
                     values:

                             <b>all </b>- list all of the tables.

                             <b>cache </b>- dump the routing cache.

              <b>vrf </b><i>NAME</i>
                     show the routes for the table associated with the
                     vrf name

              <b>cloned</b>

              <b>cached </b>list cloned routes i.e. routes which were
                     dynamically forked from other routes because some
                     route attribute (f.e. MTU) was updated.  Actually,
                     it is equivalent to <b>table cache</b>.

              <b>from </b><i>SELECTOR</i>
                     the same syntax as for <b>to</b>, but it binds the source
                     address range rather than destinations.  Note that
                     the <b>from </b>option only works with cloned routes.

              <b>protocol </b><i>RTPROTO</i>
                     only list routes of this protocol.

              <b>scope </b><i>SCOPE_VAL</i>
                     only list routes with this scope.

              <b>type </b><i>TYPE</i>
                     only list routes of this type.

              <b>dev </b><i>NAME</i>
                     only list routes going via this device.

              <b>via </b><i>[ FAMILY ] PREFIX</i>
                     only list routes going via the nexthop routers
                     selected by <i>PREFIX</i>.

              <b>src </b><i>PREFIX</i>
                     only list routes with preferred source addresses
                     selected by <i>PREFIX</i>.

              <b>realm </b><i>REALMID</i>

              <b>realms </b><i>FROMREALM/TOREALM</i>
                     only list routes with these realms.

       ip route flush
              flush routing tables
              this command flushes routes selected by some criteria.

              The arguments have the same syntax and semantics as the
              arguments of <b>ip route show</b>, but routing tables are not
              listed but purged. The only difference is the default
              action: <b>show </b>dumps all the IP main routing table but <b>flush</b>
              prints the helper page.

              With the <b>-statistics </b>option, the command becomes verbose.
              It prints out the number of deleted routes and the number
              of rounds made to flush the routing table. If the option
              is given twice, <b>ip route flush </b>also dumps all the deleted
              routes in the format described in the previous subsection.

       ip route get
              get a single route
              this command gets a single route to a destination and
              prints its contents exactly as the kernel sees it.

              <b>fibmatch</b>
                     Return full fib lookup matched route. Default is to
                     return the resolved dst entry

              <b>to </b><i>ADDRESS</i> <b>(default)</b>
                     the destination address.

              <b>from </b><i>ADDRESS</i>
                     the source address.

              <b>tos </b><i>TOS</i>

              <b>dsfield </b><i>TOS</i>
                     the Type Of Service.

              <b>iif </b><i>NAME</i>
                     the device from which this packet is expected to
                     arrive.

              <b>oif </b><i>NAME</i>
                     force the output device on which this packet will
                     be routed.

              <b>mark </b><i>MARK</i>
                     the firewall mark (<b>fwmark</b>)

              <b>vrf </b><i>NAME</i>
                     force the vrf device on which this packet will be
                     routed.

              <b>ipproto </b><i>PROTOCOL</i>
                     ip protocol as seen by the route lookup

              <b>sport </b><i>NUMBER</i>
                     source port as seen by the route lookup

              <b>dport </b><i>NUMBER</i>
                     destination port as seen by the route lookup

              <b>connected</b>
                     if no source address (option <b>from</b>) was given,
                     relookup the route with the source set to the
                     preferred address received from the first lookup.
                     If policy routing is used, it may be a different
                     route.

              Note that this operation is not equivalent to <b>ip route</b>
              <b>show</b>.  <b>show </b>shows existing routes.  <b>get </b>resolves them and
              creates new clones if necessary. Essentially, <b>get </b>is
              equivalent to sending a packet along this path.  If the
              <b>iif </b>argument is not given, the kernel creates a route to
              output packets towards the requested destination.  This is
              equivalent to pinging the destination with a subsequent <b>ip</b>
              <b>route ls cache</b>, however, no packets are actually sent.
              With the <b>iif </b>argument, the kernel pretends that a packet
              arrived from this interface and searches for a path to
              forward the packet.

       ip route save
              save routing table information to stdout
              This command behaves like <b>ip route show </b>except that the
              output is raw data suitable for passing to <b>ip route</b>
              <b>restore</b>.

       ip route restore
              restore routing table information from stdin
              This command expects to read a data stream as returned
              from <b>ip route save</b>.  It will attempt to restore the
              routing table information exactly as it was at the time of
              the save, so any translation of information in the stream
              (such as device indexes) must be done first. Any existing
              routes are left unchanged. Any routes specified in the
              data stream that already exist in the table will be
              ignored.
