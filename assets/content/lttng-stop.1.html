       The <b>lttng stop </b>command stops the various LTTng tracers for a
       given active tracing session.

       Stopping the LTTng tracers has the effect that all enabled event
       rules within enabled channels cannot make event sources <i>emit</i>
       trace events anymore.

       A tracing session with no running tracers is said to be <i>inactive</i>.
       Inactive tracing sessions can be set active using the
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/lttng-start.1.html">lttng-start(1)</a> command.

       If <i>SESSION</i> is omitted, the LTTng tracers are stopped for the
       current tracing session (see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/lttng-create.1.html">lttng-create(1)</a> for more information
       about the current tracing session). Otherwise, they are stopped
       for the existing tracing session named <i>SESSION</i>. <b>lttng list</b>
       outputs all the existing tracing sessions (see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/lttng-list.1.html">lttng-list(1)</a>).

       By default, the <b>lttng stop </b>command ensures that the tracing
       session’s trace data is valid before returning to the prompt.
       With the <b>--no-wait </b>option, the command finishes immediately,
       hence a local trace might not be valid when the command is done.
       In this case, there is no way to know when the trace becomes
       valid.

       If at least one rotation occurred during the chosen tracing
       session’s lifetime (see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/lttng-rotate.1.html">lttng-rotate(1)</a> and
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/lttng-enable-rotation.1.html">lttng-enable-rotation(1)</a>), the <b>lttng stop </b>command renames the
       current trace chunk subdirectory and prints the renamed path.
       Although it is safe to read the content of this renamed
       subdirectory while the tracing session remains inactive (until
       the next <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/lttng-start.1.html">lttng-start(1)</a>), it is NOT a trace chunk archive: you
       need to destroy the tracing session with <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/lttng-destroy.1.html">lttng-destroy(1)</a> or make
       a rotation with <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/lttng-rotate.1.html">lttng-rotate(1)</a> to archive it.
