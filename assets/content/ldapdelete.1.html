       <i>ldapdelete</i> is a shell-accessible interface to the
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/ldap_delete_ext.3.html">ldap_delete_ext(3)</a> library call.

       <b>ldapdelete </b>opens a connection to an LDAP server, binds, and
       deletes one or more entries.  If one or more <i>DN</i> arguments are
       provided, entries with those Distinguished Names are deleted.
       Each <i>DN</i> should be provided using the LDAPv3 string representation
       as defined in RFC 4514.  If no <i>DN</i> arguments are provided, a list
       of DNs is read from standard input (or from <i>file</i> if the <b>-f </b>flag
       is used).
