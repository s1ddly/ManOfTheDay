       POSIX message queues allow processes to exchange data in the form
       of messages.  This API is distinct from that provided by System V
       message queues (<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/msgget.2.html">msgget(2)</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/msgsnd.2.html">msgsnd(2)</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/msgrcv.2.html">msgrcv(2)</a>, etc.), but
       provides similar functionality.

       Message queues are created and opened using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/mq_open.3.html">mq_open(3)</a>; this
       function returns a <i>message queue descriptor</i> (<i>mqd_t</i>), which is
       used to refer to the open message queue in later calls.  Each
       message queue is identified by a name of the form <i>/somename</i>; that
       is, a null-terminated string of up to <b>NAME_MAX </b>(i.e., 255)
       characters consisting of an initial slash, followed by one or
       more characters, none of which are slashes.  Two processes can
       operate on the same queue by passing the same name to <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/mq_open.3.html">mq_open(3)</a>.

       Messages are transferred to and from a queue using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/mq_send.3.html">mq_send(3)</a> and
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/mq_receive.3.html">mq_receive(3)</a>.  When a process has finished using the queue, it
       closes it using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/mq_close.3.html">mq_close(3)</a>, and when the queue is no longer
       required, it can be deleted using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/mq_unlink.3.html">mq_unlink(3)</a>.  Queue attributes
       can be retrieved and (in some cases) modified using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/mq_getattr.3.html">mq_getattr(3)</a>
       and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/mq_setattr.3.html">mq_setattr(3)</a>.  A process can request asynchronous
       notification of the arrival of a message on a previously empty
       queue using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/mq_notify.3.html">mq_notify(3)</a>.

       A message queue descriptor is a reference to an <i>open message</i>
       <i>queue description</i> (see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/open.2.html">open(2)</a>).  After a <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fork.2.html">fork(2)</a>, a child
       inherits copies of its parent's message queue descriptors, and
       these descriptors refer to the same open message queue
       descriptions as the corresponding message queue descriptors in
       the parent.  Corresponding message queue descriptors in the two
       processes share the flags (<i>mq_flags</i>) that are associated with the
       open message queue description.

       Each message has an associated <i>priority</i>, and messages are always
       delivered to the receiving process highest priority first.
       Message priorities range from 0 (low) to
       <i>sysconf(_SC_MQ_PRIO_MAX) - 1</i> (high).  On Linux,
       <i>sysconf(_SC_MQ_PRIO_MAX)</i> returns 32768, but POSIX.1 requires only
       that an implementation support at least priorities in the range 0
       to 31; some implementations provide only this range.

       The remainder of this section describes some specific details of
       the Linux implementation of POSIX message queues.

   <b>Library interfaces and system calls</b>
       In most cases the <b>mq_*</b>() library interfaces listed above are
       implemented on top of underlying system calls of the same name.
       Deviations from this scheme are indicated in the following table:

              <b>Library interface    System call</b>
              mq_close(3)          close(2)
              mq_getattr(3)        mq_getsetattr(2)
              mq_notify(3)         mq_notify(2)
              mq_open(3)           mq_open(2)
              mq_receive(3)        mq_timedreceive(2)
              mq_send(3)           mq_timedsend(2)
              mq_setattr(3)        mq_getsetattr(2)
              mq_timedreceive(3)   mq_timedreceive(2)

              mq_timedsend(3)      mq_timedsend(2)
              mq_unlink(3)         mq_unlink(2)

   <b>Versions</b>
       POSIX message queues have been supported on Linux since kernel
       2.6.6.  Glibc support has been provided since version 2.3.4.

   <b>Kernel configuration</b>
       Support for POSIX message queues is configurable via the
       <b>CONFIG_POSIX_MQUEUE </b>kernel configuration option.  This option is
       enabled by default.

   <b>Persistence</b>
       POSIX message queues have kernel persistence: if not removed by
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/mq_unlink.3.html">mq_unlink(3)</a>, a message queue will exist until the system is shut
       down.

   <b>Linking</b>
       Programs using the POSIX message queue API must be compiled with
       <i>cc -lrt</i> to link against the real-time library, <i>librt</i>.

   <b>/proc interfaces</b>
       The following interfaces can be used to limit the amount of
       kernel memory consumed by POSIX message queues and to set the
       default attributes for new message queues:

       <i>/proc/sys/fs/mqueue/msg_default</i> (since Linux 3.5)
              This file defines the value used for a new queue's
              <i>mq_maxmsg</i> setting when the queue is created with a call to
              <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/mq_open.3.html">mq_open(3)</a> where <i>attr</i> is specified as NULL.  The default
              value for this file is 10.  The minimum and maximum are as
              for <i>/proc/sys/fs/mqueue/msg_max</i>.  A new queue's default
              <i>mq_maxmsg</i> value will be the smaller of <i>msg_default</i> and
              <i>msg_max</i>.  Up until Linux 2.6.28, the default <i>mq_maxmsg</i> was
              10; from Linux 2.6.28 to Linux 3.4, the default was the
              value defined for the <i>msg_max</i> limit.

       <i>/proc/sys/fs/mqueue/msg_max</i>
              This file can be used to view and change the ceiling value
              for the maximum number of messages in a queue.  This value
              acts as a ceiling on the <i>attr-&gt;mq_maxmsg</i> argument given to
              <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/mq_open.3.html">mq_open(3)</a>.  The default value for <i>msg_max</i> is 10.  The
              minimum value is 1 (10 in kernels before 2.6.28).  The
              upper limit is <b>HARD_MSGMAX</b>.  The <i>msg_max</i> limit is ignored
              for privileged processes (<b>CAP_SYS_RESOURCE</b>), but the
              <b>HARD_MSGMAX </b>ceiling is nevertheless imposed.

              The definition of <b>HARD_MSGMAX </b>has changed across kernel
              versions:

              *  Up to Linux 2.6.32: <i>131072 / sizeof(void *)</i>

              *  Linux 2.6.33 to 3.4: <i>(32768 * sizeof(void *) / 4)</i>

              *  Since Linux 3.5: 65,536

       <i>/proc/sys/fs/mqueue/msgsize_default</i> (since Linux 3.5)
              This file defines the value used for a new queue's
              <i>mq_msgsize</i> setting when the queue is created with a call
              to <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/mq_open.3.html">mq_open(3)</a> where <i>attr</i> is specified as NULL.  The
              default value for this file is 8192 (bytes).  The minimum
              and maximum are as for <i>/proc/sys/fs/mqueue/msgsize_max</i>.
              If <i>msgsize_default</i> exceeds <i>msgsize_max</i>, a new queue's
              default <i>mq_msgsize</i> value is capped to the <i>msgsize_max</i>
              limit.  Up until Linux 2.6.28, the default <i>mq_msgsize</i> was
              8192; from Linux 2.6.28 to Linux 3.4, the default was the
              value defined for the <i>msgsize_max</i> limit.

       <i>/proc/sys/fs/mqueue/msgsize_max</i>
              This file can be used to view and change the ceiling on
              the maximum message size.  This value acts as a ceiling on
              the <i>attr-&gt;mq_msgsize</i> argument given to <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/mq_open.3.html">mq_open(3)</a>.  The
              default value for <i>msgsize_max</i> is 8192 bytes.  The minimum
              value is 128 (8192 in kernels before 2.6.28).  The upper
              limit for <i>msgsize_max</i> has varied across kernel versions:

              *  Before Linux 2.6.28, the upper limit is <b>INT_MAX</b>.

              *  From Linux 2.6.28 to 3.4, the limit is 1,048,576.

              *  Since Linux 3.5, the limit is 16,777,216
                 (<b>HARD_MSGSIZEMAX</b>).

              The <i>msgsize_max</i> limit is ignored for privileged process
              (<b>CAP_SYS_RESOURCE</b>), but, since Linux 3.5, the
              <b>HARD_MSGSIZEMAX </b>ceiling is enforced for privileged
              processes.

       <i>/proc/sys/fs/mqueue/queues_max</i>
              This file can be used to view and change the system-wide
              limit on the number of message queues that can be created.
              The default value for <i>queues_max</i> is 256.  No ceiling is
              imposed on the <i>queues_max</i> limit; privileged processes
              (<b>CAP_SYS_RESOURCE</b>) can exceed the limit (but see BUGS).

   <b>Resource limit</b>
       The <b>RLIMIT_MSGQUEUE </b>resource limit, which places a limit on the
       amount of space that can be consumed by all of the message queues
       belonging to a process's real user ID, is described in
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getrlimit.2.html">getrlimit(2)</a>.

   <b>Mounting the message queue filesystem</b>
       On Linux, message queues are created in a virtual filesystem.
       (Other implementations may also provide such a feature, but the
       details are likely to differ.)  This filesystem can be mounted
       (by the superuser) using the following commands:

           # <b>mkdir /dev/mqueue</b>
           # <b>mount -t mqueue none /dev/mqueue</b>

       The sticky bit is automatically enabled on the mount directory.

       After the filesystem has been mounted, the message queues on the
       system can be viewed and manipulated using the commands usually
       used for files (e.g., <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ls.1.html">ls(1)</a> and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/rm.1.html">rm(1)</a>).

       The contents of each file in the directory consist of a single
       line containing information about the queue:

           $ <b>cat /dev/mqueue/mymq</b>
           QSIZE:129     NOTIFY:2    SIGNO:0    NOTIFY_PID:8260

       These fields are as follows:

       <b>QSIZE  </b>Number of bytes of data in all messages in the queue (but
              see BUGS).

       <b>NOTIFY_PID</b>
              If this is nonzero, then the process with this PID has
              used <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/mq_notify.3.html">mq_notify(3)</a> to register for asynchronous message
              notification, and the remaining fields describe how
              notification occurs.

       <b>NOTIFY </b>Notification method: 0 is <b>SIGEV_SIGNAL</b>; 1 is <b>SIGEV_NONE</b>;
              and 2 is <b>SIGEV_THREAD</b>.

       <b>SIGNO  </b>Signal number to be used for <b>SIGEV_SIGNAL</b>.

   <b>Linux implementation of message queue descriptors</b>
       On Linux, a message queue descriptor is actually a file
       descriptor.  (POSIX does not require such an implementation.)
       This means that a message queue descriptor can be monitored using
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/select.2.html">select(2)</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/poll.2.html">poll(2)</a>, or <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/epoll.7.html">epoll(7)</a>.  This is not portable.

       The close-on-exec flag (see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/open.2.html">open(2)</a>) is automatically set on the
       file descriptor returned by <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mq_open.2.html">mq_open(2)</a>.

   <b>IPC namespaces</b>
       For a discussion of the interaction of POSIX message queue
       objects and IPC namespaces, see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/ipc_namespaces.7.html">ipc_namespaces(7)</a>.
