       <b>wipefs </b>can erase filesystem, raid or partition-table signatures
       (magic strings) from the specified <i>device</i> to make the signatures
       invisible for libblkid. <b>wipefs </b>does not erase the filesystem
       itself nor any other data from the device.

       When used without any options, <b>wipefs </b>lists all visible
       filesystems and the offsets of their basic signatures. The
       default output is subject to change. So whenever possible, you
       should avoid using default outputs in your scripts. Always
       explicitly define expected columns by using <b>--output </b><i>columns-list</i>
       in environments where a stable output is required.

       <b>wipefs </b>calls the BLKRRPART ioctl when it has erased a
       partition-table signature to inform the kernel about the change.
       The ioctl is called as the last step and when all specified
       signatures from all specified devices are already erased. This
       feature can be used to wipe content on partitions devices as well
       as partition table on a disk device, for example by <b>wipefs -a</b>
       <b>/dev/sdc1 /dev/sdc2 /dev/sdc</b>.

       Note that some filesystems and some partition tables store more
       magic strings on the device (e.g., FAT, ZFS, GPT). The <b>wipefs</b>
       command (since v2.31) lists all the offset where a magic strings
       have been detected.

       When option <b>-a </b>is used, all magic strings that are visible for
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/libblkid.3.html">libblkid(3)</a> are erased. In this case the <b>wipefs </b>scans the device
       again after each modification (erase) until no magic string is
       found.

       Note that by default <b>wipefs </b>does not erase nested partition
       tables on non-whole disk devices. For this the option <b>--force </b>is
       required.
