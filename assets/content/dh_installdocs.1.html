       <b>dh_installdocs </b>is a debhelper program that is responsible for
       installing documentation into <i>usr/share/doc/package</i> in package
       build directories.

       In compat 10 and earlier, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dh_install.1.html">dh_install(1)</a> may be a better tool for
       handling the upstream documentation, when upstream's own build
       system installs all the desired documentation correctly.  In this
       case, <b>dh_installdocs </b>is still useful for installing packaging
       related documentation (e.g. the <i>debian/copyright</i> file).

       From debhelper compatibility level 11 on, <b>dh_install </b>will fall
       back to looking in <i>debian/tmp</i> for files, if it does not find them
       in the current directory (or wherever you've told it to look
       using <b>--sourcedir</b>).

       In compat 11 and later, <b>dh_installdocs </b>offers many of the
       features that <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dh_install.1.html">dh_install(1)</a> also has.  Furthermore,
       <b>dh_installdocs </b>also supports the <b>nodoc </b>build profile to exclude
       documentation (regardless of compat level).
