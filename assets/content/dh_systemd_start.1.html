       <b>dh_systemd_start </b>is a debhelper program that is responsible for
       starting/stopping or restarting systemd unit files in case no
       corresponding sysv init script is available.

       As with <b>dh_installinit</b>, the unit file is stopped before upgrades
       and started afterwards (unless <b>--restart-after-upgrade </b>is
       specified, in which case it will only be restarted after the
       upgrade).  This logic is not used when there is a corresponding
       SysV init script because invoke-rc.d performs the
       stop/start/restart in that case.
