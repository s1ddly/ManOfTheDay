       <b>pmsnap </b>is a shell script that is normally run periodically from
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/crontab.1.html">crontab(1)</a> to generate graphic images of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmchart.1.html">pmchart(1)</a> performance
       charts.  These images can be in any of the supported <b>pmchart</b>
       formats, including <i>png</i>, <i>bmp</i>, and <i>jpeg</i>, and may be incorporated
       into the content offered by the local web server.  By default
       <b>pmsnap </b>generates no textual output unless some error or warning
       condition is encountered.

       <b>pmsnap </b>generates images according to its control file,
       <b>$PCP_PMSNAPCONTROL_PATH </b>(or <b>dir/control </b>if the <b>-C </b>option is
       specified), and uses archive logs created by <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> or PCP
       archive folios created by <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmafm.1.html">pmafm(1)</a> and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmlogger_check.1.html">pmlogger_check(1)</a>.  Before
       attempting to configure <b>pmsnap</b>, it is strongly recommended that
       <b>pmlogger </b>be configured according to the descriptions in
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmlogger_daily.1.html">pmlogger_daily(1)</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmlogger_check.1.html">pmlogger_check(1)</a> and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a>.

       Once <b>pmlogger </b>has been configured, it is necessary to configure
       <b>pmsnap </b>as follows;

       1.     Edit the control file <b>$PCP_PMSNAPCONTROL_PATH</b>.  The syntax
              of this file is described in the comment at the head of
              the file and an example is supplied for one and twelve
              hour "Summary" performance charts for the local host.
              Suitable arguments for <b>pmchart </b>are also described in the
              comment.  The user should consult <b>pmchart </b>for further
              details.  Note that when <b>pmsnap </b>is run, it globally
              substitutes the string <b>LOCALHOSTNAME </b>with the name of the
              local host in the control file.

       2.     Test the configuration by running
                               <b>$PCP_BINADM_DIR/pmsnap</b>.
              Without any arguments <b>pmsnap </b>will process every non-
              comment line in <b>$PCP_PMSNAPCONTROL_PATH</b>.  The output
              images will be placed in the files named in the first
              field of each line in the control file, with the file
              format appended if necessary.  If these file names do not
              start with <b>/ </b>or <b>.  </b>then they are assumed relative to <i>dir</i>,
              as specified with the <b>-o </b>option.  The default <i>dir</i> is the
              current directory.  Note that if <b>pmlogger </b>has only been
              recently started (within about the last 15 minutes),
              snapshot images may not be produced and no error messages
              will be issued - the reason is that <b>pmchart </b>can not use
              very short archives and hence, neither can <b>pmsnap</b>.  For
              debugging purposes the <b>-V </b>flag should be used.

       3.     Add an appropriate entry for <b>pmsnap </b>in the <b>root </b>user's
              <b>crontab</b>.  An example is supplied in
              <b>$PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmlogger/crontab</b>.

       4.     Incorporate the <b>pmsnap </b>images into the local WWW content.
              Usually, WWW pages use images that are relative to a
              particular document root, so it is often convenient to use
              the <b>-o </b>command line option to specify a sub-directory of
              the local WWW content, and then create a web page in this
              directory that shows the snapshot images with text and
              other content appropriate to the local environment.

       A sample HTML page, suitable for the Summary snapshot may be
       found in <b>$PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmsnap/Summary.html</b>.

       Although <b>pmsnap </b>attempts to flush <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/stdio.3.html">stdio(3)</a> output buffers in the
       relevant <b>pmlogger </b>processes before generating snapshots images,
       this may fail for assorted reasons and no error message will be
       given.

       <b>pmsnap </b>should not be invoked immediately after <b>pmlogger_daily </b>has
       rolled the logs because the new archive logs will be too short to
       obtain meaningful results.  Note however that <b>pmsnap </b>will not
       report errors from <b>pmchart </b>about not being able to comply with
       the <b>-A </b>option on very short archives.  In these cases no error
       will be reported and no output images will be produced.
