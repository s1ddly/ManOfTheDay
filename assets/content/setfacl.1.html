<pre>
       This utility sets Access Control Lists (ACLs) of files and
       directories.  On the command line, a sequence of commands is
       followed by a sequence of files (which in turn can be followed by
       another sequence of commands, ...).

       The <i>-m</i> and <i>-x</i> options expect an ACL on the command line. Multiple
       ACL entries are separated by comma characters (`,'). The <i>-M</i> and
       <i>-X</i> options read an ACL from a file or from standard input. The
       ACL entry format is described in Section ACL ENTRIES.

       The <i>--set</i> and <i>--set-file</i> options set the ACL of a file or a
       directory. The previous ACL is replaced.  ACL entries for this
       operation must include permissions.

       The <i>-m (--modify)</i> and <i>-M (--modify-file)</i> options modify the ACL
       of a file or directory.  ACL entries for this operation must
       include permissions.

       The <i>-x (--remove)</i> and <i>-X (--remove-file)</i> options remove ACL
       entries. It is not an error to remove an entry which does not
       exist.  Only ACL entries without the <i>perms</i> field are accepted as
       parameters, unless POSIXLY_CORRECT is defined.

       When reading from files using the <i>-M</i> and <i>-X</i> options, setfacl
       accepts the output getfacl produces.  There is at most one ACL
       entry per line. After a Pound sign (`#'), everything up to the
       end of the line is treated as a comment.

       If setfacl is used on a file system which does not support ACLs,
       setfacl operates on the file mode permission bits. If the ACL
       does not fit completely in the permission bits, setfacl modifies
       the file mode permission bits to reflect the ACL as closely as
       possible, writes an error message to standard error, and returns
       with an exit status greater than 0.

   <b>PERMISSIONS</b>
       The file owner and processes capable of CAP_FOWNER are granted
       the right to modify ACLs of a file. This is analogous to the
       permissions required for accessing the file mode. (On current
       Linux systems, root is the only user with the CAP_FOWNER
       capability.)
