       <b>pmdalustrecomm </b>is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
       extracts performance metrics from the Linux procfs filesystem
       about the state of various aspects of the Lustre filesystem.

       The <b>lustrecomm </b>PMDA exports metrics that focus on distributed
       communication in the filesystem, including metrics related to
       timeouts, network drops, send/recv information and route lengths.
       However, it also covers the memory use of some of the Lustre
       filesystem components.

       A brief description of the <b>pmdalustrecomm </b>command line options
       follows:

       <b>-d   </b>It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics <i>domain</i>
            number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is,
            <i>domain</i> should be different for every PMDA on the one host,
            and the same <i>domain</i> number should be used for the same PMDA
            on all hosts.

       <b>-l   </b>Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
            <i>lustrecomm.log</i> is written in the current directory of
            <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> when <b>pmdalustrecomm </b>is started, i.e.
            <b>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd</b>.  If the log file cannot be created or is
            not writable, output is written to the standard error
            instead.

       <b>-U   </b>User account under which to run the agent.  The default is
            the unprivileged "pcp" account in current versions of PCP,
            but in older versions the superuser account ("root") was
            used by default.
