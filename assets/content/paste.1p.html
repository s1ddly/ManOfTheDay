<pre>
       The <i>paste</i> utility shall concatenate the corresponding lines of
       the given input files, and write the resulting lines to standard
       output.

       The default operation of <i>paste</i> shall concatenate the
       corresponding lines of the input files. The &lt;newline&gt; of every
       line except the line from the last input file shall be replaced
       with a &lt;tab&gt;.

       If an end-of-file condition is detected on one or more input
       files, but not all input files, <i>paste</i> shall behave as though
       empty lines were read from the files on which end-of-file was
       detected, unless the <b>-s </b>option is specified.
