       The <b>unicode_start </b>command will put the keyboard and console into
       Unicode (UTF-8) mode.

       For the keyboard this means that one can attach 16-bit U+xxxx
       values to keyboard keys using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/loadkeys.1.html">loadkeys(1)</a>, and have these appear
       as UTF-8 input to user programs.  Also, that one can type
       hexadecimal Alt-xxxx using the numeric keypad, and again produce
       UTF-8.

       For the console this means that the kernel expects UTF-8 output
       from user programs, and displays the output accordingly.

       The parameter <i>font</i> is a font that is loaded. It should have a
       built-in Unicode map, or, if it hasn't, such a map can be given
       explicitly as second parameter.  When no font was specified, the
       current font is kept.
