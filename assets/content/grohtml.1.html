<pre>
       The GNU <i>roff</i> system's HTML support consists of a preprocessor,
       <i>pre-grohtml</i>, and a device driver, <i>post-grohtml</i>; together, they
       translate <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/roff.7.html">roff(7)</a> documents to HTML.  Users should always invoke
       <i>grohtml</i> via the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/groff.1.html">groff(1)</a> command with the <b>-Thtml </b>option.  If no
       operands are given, or if <i>file</i> is “<b>-</b>”, <i>grohtml</i> reads the standard
       input stream.  Output is written to the standard output stream.
       When <i>grohtml</i> is run by <i>groff</i>, options can be passed to <i>grohtml</i>
       using <i>groff</i>'s <b>-P </b>option.

       <i>grohtml</i> invokes <i>groff</i> twice.  In the first pass, the preprocessor
       <i>pre-grohtml</i> renders pictures, equations, and tables as images in
       PostScript format using the <b>ps </b>output driver.  In the second
       pass, the output driver <i>post-grohtml</i> translates the output of
       <i>troff</i>(1) to HTML.

       <i>grohtml</i> always writes output encoded in UTF-8 and has built-in
       entities for all non-composite Unicode characters.  In spite of
       this, <i>groff</i> may issue warnings about unknown special characters
       if they can't be found during the first pass.  Such warnings can
       be safely ignored unless the special characters appear inside a
       table or equation.
