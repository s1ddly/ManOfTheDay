       The general forms of rpm digital signature commands are

       <b>rpmkeys --import </b><i>PUBKEY ...</i>

       <b>rpmkeys </b>{<b>-K|--checksig</b>} <i>PACKAGE_FILE ...</i>

       The <b>--checksig </b>option checks all the digests and signatures
       contained in <i>PACKAGE_FILE</i> to ensure the integrity and origin of
       the package.  Note that signatures are now verified whenever a
       package is read, and <b>--checksig </b>is useful to verify all of the
       digests and signatures associated with a package.

       Digital signatures cannot be verified without a public key.  An
       ASCII armored public key can be added to the <b>rpm </b>database using
       <b>--import</b>.  An imported public key is carried in a header, and key
       ring management is performed exactly like package management.
       For example, all currently imported public keys can be displayed
       by:

       <b>rpm -qa gpg-pubkey*</b>

       Details about a specific public key, when imported, can be
       displayed by querying.  Here's information about the Red Hat
       GPG/DSA key:

       <b>rpm -qi gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</b>

       Finally, public keys can be erased after importing just like
       packages.  Here's how to remove the Red Hat GPG/DSA key

       <b>rpm -e gpg-pubkey-db42a60e</b>
