       <b>pmdasendmail </b>is a sendmail Performance Metrics Domain Agent
       (PMDA) which exports mail traffic statistics as collected by
       <b>sendmail</b>(1).

       Before the sendmail PMDA can export any metrics, <b>sendmail</b>(1) must
       have statistics collection enabled.  This involves checking the
       name of the statistics file, as given by the <b>OS </b>or <b>O StatusFile</b>
       control lines in <b>/etc/sendmail.cf</b>, and then creating this file if
       it does not already exist.  Removing the file will terminate
       statistics collection by <b>sendmail</b>(1) and hence the sendmail PMDA.

       A brief description of the <b>pmdasendmail </b>command line options
       follows:

       <b>-d   </b>It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics <i>domain</i>
            number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is,
            <i>domain</i> should be different for every PMDA on the one host,
            and the same <i>domain</i> number should be used for the same PMDA
            on all hosts.

       <b>-l   </b>Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
            <i>sendmail.log</i> is written in the current directory of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a>
            when <b>pmdasendmail </b>is started, i.e.  <b>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd</b>.  If
            the log file cannot be created or is not writable, output is
            written to the standard error instead.

       <b>-U   </b>User account under which to run the agent.  The default is
            the unprivileged "pcp" account in current versions of PCP,
            but in older versions the superuser account ("root") was
            used by default.

       There are no communication options, as the <i>Install</i> script ensures
       the sendmail PMDA will be connected to PMCD by a pipe.
