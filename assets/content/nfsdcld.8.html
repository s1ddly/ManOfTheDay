       nfsdcld is the NFSv4 client tracking daemon. It is not necessary
       to run this daemon on machines that are not acting as NFSv4
       servers.

       When a network partition is combined with a server reboot, there
       are edge conditions that can cause the server to grant lock
       reclaims when other clients have taken conflicting locks in the
       interim. A more detailed explanation of this issue is described
       in RFC 3530, section 8.6.3.

       In order to prevent these problems, the server must track a small
       amount of per-client information on stable storage. This daemon
       provides the userspace piece of that functionality.
