       The <b>sadc </b>command samples system data a specified number of times
       (<i>count</i>) at a specified interval measured in seconds (<i>interval</i>).
       It writes in binary format to the specified <i>outfile</i> or to
       standard output. If <i>outfile</i> is set to <b>-</b>, then <b>sadc </b>uses the
       standard system activity daily data file (see below).  In this
       case, if the file already exists, <b>sadc </b>will overwrite it if it is
       from a previous month. By default <b>sadc </b>collects most of the data
       available from the kernel.  But there are also optional metrics,
       for which the relevant options must be explicitly passed to <b>sadc</b>
       to be collected (see option <b>-S </b>below).

       The standard system activity daily data file is named <i>saDD</i> unless
       option <b>-D </b>is used, in which case its name is <i>saYYYYMMDD</i>, where
       <i>YYYY</i> stands for the current year, <i>MM</i> for the current month and <i>DD</i>
       for the current day. By default it is located in the <i>/var/log/sa</i>
       directory. Yet it is possible to specify an alternate location
       for it: If <i>outfile</i> is a directory (instead of a plain file) then
       it will be considered as the directory where the standard system
       activity daily data file will be saved.

       When the <i>count</i> parameter is not specified, <b>sadc </b>writes its data
       endlessly. When both <i>interval</i> and <i>count</i> are not specified, and
       option <b>-C </b>is not used, a dummy record, which is used at system
       startup to mark the time when the counter restarts from 0, will
       be written.  For example, one of the system startup script may
       write the restart mark to the daily data file by the command
       entry:

       <b>/usr/local/lib64/sa/sadc -</b>

       The <b>sadc </b>command is intended to be used as a backend to the <b>sar</b>
       command.

       Note: The <b>sadc </b>command only reports on local activities.
