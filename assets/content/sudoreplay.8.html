     <b>sudoreplay </b>plays back or lists the output logs created by <b>sudo</b>.
     When replaying, <b>sudoreplay </b>can play the session back in real-time,
     or the playback speed may be adjusted (faster or slower) based on
     the command line options.

     The <i>ID</i> should either be a six character sequence of digits and
     upper case letters, e.g., 0100A5 or a path name.  The <i>ID</i> may
     include an optional <i>@offset</i> suffix which may be used to start
     replaying at a specific time offset.  The <i>@offset</i> is specified as a
     number in seconds since the start of the session with an optional
     decimal fraction.

     Path names may be relative to the I/O log directory
     <i>/var/log/sudo-io</i> (unless overridden by the <b>-d </b>option) or fully
     qualified, beginning with a ‘/’ character.  When a command is run
     via <b>sudo </b>with <i>log_output</i> enabled in the <i>sudoers</i> file, a TSID=ID
     string is logged via syslog or to the <b>sudo </b>log file.  The <i>ID</i> may
     also be determined using <b>sudoreplay</b>'s list mode.

     In list mode, <b>sudoreplay </b>can be used to find the ID of a session
     based on a number of criteria such as the user, tty or command run.

     In replay mode, if the standard input and output are connected to a
     terminal and the <b>-n </b>option is not specified, <b>sudoreplay </b>will
     operate interactively.  In interactive mode, <b>sudoreplay </b>will
     attempt to adjust the terminal size to match that of the session
     and write directly to the terminal (not all terminals support
     this).  Additionally, it will poll the keyboard and act on the
     following keys:

     ‘\n’ or ‘\r’  Skip to the next replay event; useful for long
                   pauses.

     ‘ ’ (space)   Pause output; press any key to resume.

     ‘&lt;’           Reduce the playback speed by one half.

     ‘&gt;’           Double the playback speed.

     The session can be interrupted via control-C.  When the session has
     finished, the terminal is restored to its original size if it was
     changed during playback.

     The options are as follows:

     <b>-d </b><i>dir</i>, <b>--directory</b>=<i>dir</i>
                 Store session logs in <i>dir</i> instead of the default,
                 <i>/var/log/sudo-io</i>.

     <b>-f </b><i>filter</i>, <b>--filter</b>=<i>filter</i>
                 Select which I/O type(s) to display.  By default,
                 <b>sudoreplay </b>will display the command's standard output,
                 standard error and tty output.  The <i>filter</i> argument is
                 a comma-separated list, consisting of one or more of
                 following: <i>stdin</i>, <i>stdout</i>, <i>stderr</i>, <i>ttyin</i>, and <i>ttyout</i>.

     <b>-F</b>, <b>--follow</b>
                 Enable “follow mode”.  When replaying a session,
                 <b>sudoreplay </b>will ignore end-of-file and keep replaying
                 until the log is complete.  This can be used to replay
                 a session that is still in progress, similar to “tail
                 -f”.  An I/O log file is considered to be complete when
                 the write bits have been cleared on the session's
                 timing file.  Note that versions of <b>sudo </b>prior to 1.9.1
                 do not clear the write bits upon completion.

     <b>-h</b>, <b>--help  </b>Display a short help message to the standard output and
                 exit.

     <b>-l</b>, <b>--list </b>[<i>search expression</i>]
                 Enable “list mode”.  In this mode, <b>sudoreplay </b>will list
                 available sessions in a format similar to the <b>sudo </b>log
                 file format, sorted by file name (or sequence number).
                 If a <i>search expression</i> is specified, it will be used to
                 restrict the IDs that are displayed.  An expression is
                 composed of the following predicates:

                 command <i>pattern</i>
                         Evaluates to true if the command run matches
                         the POSIX extended regular expression <i>pattern</i>.

                 cwd <i>directory</i>
                         Evaluates to true if the command was run with
                         the specified current working directory.

                 fromdate <i>date</i>
                         Evaluates to true if the command was run on or
                         after <i>date</i>.  See <i>Date and time format</i> for a
                         description of supported date and time formats.

                 group <i>runas_group</i>
                         Evaluates to true if the command was run with
                         the specified <i>runas_group</i>.  Note that unless a
                         <i>runas_group</i> was explicitly specified when <b>sudo</b>
                         was run this field will be empty in the log.

                 host <i>hostname</i>
                         Evaluates to true if the command was run on the
                         specified <i>hostname</i>.

                 runas <i>runas_user</i>
                         Evaluates to true if the command was run as the
                         specified <i>runas_user</i>.  Note that <b>sudo </b>runs
                         commands as user <i>root</i> by default.

                 todate <i>date</i>
                         Evaluates to true if the command was run on or
                         prior to <i>date</i>.  See <i>Date and time format</i> for a
                         description of supported date and time formats.

                 tty <i>tty name</i>
                         Evaluates to true if the command was run on the
                         specified terminal device.  The <i>tty name</i> should
                         be specified without the <i>/dev/</i> prefix, e.g.,
                         <i>tty01</i> instead of <i>/dev/tty01</i>.

                 user <i>user name</i>
                         Evaluates to true if the ID matches a command
                         run by <i>user name</i>.

                 Predicates may be abbreviated to the shortest unique
                 string.

                 Predicates may be combined using <i>and</i>, <i>or</i> and <i>!</i>
                 operators as well as ‘(’ and ‘)’ grouping (note that
                 parentheses must generally be escaped from the shell).
                 The <i>and</i> operator is optional, adjacent predicates have
                 an implied <i>and</i> unless separated by an <i>or</i>.

     <b>-m</b>, <b>--max-wait </b><i>max_wait</i>
                 Specify an upper bound on how long to wait between key
                 presses or output data.  By default, <b>sudoreplay </b>will
                 accurately reproduce the delays between key presses or
                 program output.  However, this can be tedious when the
                 session includes long pauses.  When the <b>-m </b>option is
                 specified, <b>sudoreplay </b>will limit these pauses to at
                 most <i>max_wait</i> seconds.  The value may be specified as a
                 floating point number, e.g., <i>2.5</i>.  A <i>max_wait</i> of zero
                 or less will eliminate the pauses entirely.

     <b>-n</b>, <b>--non-interactive</b>
                 Do not prompt for user input or attempt to re-size the
                 terminal.  The session is written to the standard
                 output, not directly to the user's terminal.

     <b>-R</b>, <b>--no-resize</b>
                 Do not attempt to re-size the terminal to match the
                 terminal size of the session.

     <b>-S</b>, <b>--suspend-wait</b>
                 Wait while the command was suspended.  By default,
                 <b>sudoreplay </b>will ignore the time interval between when
                 the command was suspended and when it was resumed.  If
                 the <b>-S </b>option is specified, <b>sudoreplay </b>will wait
                 instead.

     <b>-s</b>, <b>--speed </b><i>speed_factor</i>
                 This option causes <b>sudoreplay </b>to adjust the number of
                 seconds it will wait between key presses or program
                 output.  This can be used to slow down or speed up the
                 display.  For example, a <i>speed_factor</i> of <i>2</i> would make
                 the output twice as fast whereas a <i>speed_factor</i> of <i>.5</i>
                 would make the output twice as slow.

     <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
                 Print the <b>sudoreplay </b>versions version number and exit.

   <b>Date and time format</b>
     The time and date may be specified multiple ways, common formats
     include:

     HH:MM:SS am MM/DD/CCYY timezone
             24 hour time may be used in place of am/pm.

     HH:MM:SS am Month, Day Year timezone
             24 hour time may be used in place of am/pm, and month and
             day names may be abbreviated.  Note that month and day of
             the week names must be specified in English.

     CCYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
             ISO time format

     DD Month CCYY HH:MM:SS
             The month name may be abbreviated.

     Either time or date may be omitted, the am/pm and timezone are
     optional.  If no date is specified, the current day is assumed; if
     no time is specified, the first second of the specified date is
     used.  The less significant parts of both time and date may also be
     omitted, in which case zero is assumed.

     The following are all valid time and date specifications:

     now     The current time and date.

     tomorrow
             Exactly one day from now.

     yesterday
             24 hours ago.

     2 hours ago
             2 hours ago.

     next Friday
             The first second of the Friday in the next (upcoming) week.
             Not to be confused with “this Friday” which would match the
             Friday of the current week.

     last week
             The current time but 7 days ago.  This is equivalent to “a
             week ago”.

     a fortnight ago
             The current time but 14 days ago.

     10:01 am 9/17/2009
             10:01 am, September 17, 2009.

     10:01 am
             10:01 am on the current day.

     10      10:00 am on the current day.

     9/17/2009
             00:00 am, September 17, 2009.

     10:01 am Sep 17, 2009
             10:01 am, September 17, 2009.

     Note that relative time specifications do not always work as
     expected.  For example, the “next” qualifier is intended to be used
     in conjunction with a day such as “next Monday”.  When used with
     units of weeks, months, years, etc the result will be one more than
     expected.  For example, “next week” will result in a time exactly
     two weeks from now, which is probably not what was intended.  This
     will be addressed in a future version of <b>sudoreplay</b>.

   <b>Debugging sudoreplay</b>
     <b>sudoreplay </b>versions 1.8.4 and higher support a flexible debugging
     framework that is configured via Debug lines in the sudo.conf(5)
     file.

     For more information on configuring sudo.conf(5), please refer to
