   <b>devlink port function rate show - display rate objects.</b>
       Displays specified rate object or, if not specified, all rate
       objects. Rate object can be presented by one of the two types:

       <b>leaf    </b>Represents a single devlink port; created/destroyed by
               the driver and bound to the devlink port. As example,
               some driver may create leaf rate object for every devlink
               port associated with VF. Since leaf have 1to1 mapping to
               it's devlink port, in user space it is referred as
               corresponding devlink port <i>DEV/PORT_INDEX</i>;

       <b>node    </b>Represents a group of rate objects; created/deleted by
               the user (see command below) and bound to the devlink
               device rather then to the devlink port. In userspace it
               is referred as <i>DEV/NODE_NAME</i>, where node name can be any,
               except decimal number, to avoid collisions with leafs.

       Command output show rate object identifier, it's type and rate
       values along with parent node name. Rate values printed in SI
       units which are more suitable to represent specific value. To
       print values in IEC units <b>-i </b>switch is used. JSON (<b>-j</b>) output
       always print rate values in bytes per second. Zero rate values
       means "unlimited" rates and ommited in output, as well as parent
       node name.

   <b>devlink port function rate set - set rate object parameters.</b>
       Allows set rate object's parameters. If any parameter specified
       multiple times the last occurrence is used.

       <i>DEV/PORT_INDEX</i> - specifies devlink leaf rate object.
       <i>DEV/NODE_NAME</i> - specifies devlink node rate object.

       <b>tx_share </b><i>VALUE</i> - specifies minimal tx rate value shared among all
       rate objects. If rate object is a part of some rate group, then
       this value shared with rate objects of this rate group.

       <b>tx_max </b><i>VALUE</i> - specifies maximum tx rate value.

       <i>VALUE</i>   These parameter accept a floating point number, possibly
               followed by either a unit (both SI and IEC units
               supported).

               bit or a bare number
                      Bits per second

               kbit   Kilobits per second

               mbit   Megabits per second

               gbit   Gigabits per second

               tbit   Terabits per second

               bps    Bytes per second

               kbps   Kilobytes per second

               mbps   Megabytes per second

               gbps   Gigabytes per second

               tbps   Terabytes per second

               To specify in IEC units, replace the SI prefix (k-, m-,
               g-, t-) with IEC prefix (ki-, mi-, gi- and ti-)
               respectively. Input is case-insensitive.

       <b>parent </b><i>NODE_NAME</i> | <b>noparent </b>- set rate object parent to existing
       node with name <i>NODE_NAME</i> or unset parent. Rate limits of the
       parent node applied to all it's children. Actual behaviour is
       details of driver's implementation. Setting parent to empty ("")
       name due to the kernel logic threated as parent unset.

   <b>devlink port function rate add - create node rate object with</b>
       <b>specified parameters.</b>
       Creates rate object of type node and sets parameters. Parameters
       same as for the "set" command.

       <i>DEV/NODE_NAME</i> - specifies the devlink node rate object to create.

   <b>devlink port function rate del - delete node rate object</b>
       Delete specified devlink node rate object. Node can't be deleted
       if there is any child, user must explicitly unset the parent.

       <i>DEV/NODE_NAME</i> - specifies devlink node rate object to delete.

   <b>devlink port function rate help - display usage information</b>
       Display devlink rate usage information
