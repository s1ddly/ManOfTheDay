   <b>Process ID (PID)</b>
       Each process has a unique nonnegative integer identifier that is
       assigned when the process is created using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fork.2.html">fork(2)</a>.  A process
       can obtain its PID using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getpid.2.html">getpid(2)</a>.  A PID is represented using
       the type <i>pid_t</i> (defined in <i>&lt;sys/types.h&gt;</i>).

       PIDs are used in a range of system calls to identify the process
       affected by the call, for example: <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/kill.2.html">kill(2)</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ptrace.2.html">ptrace(2)</a>,
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setpriority.2.html">setpriority(2)</a> <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setpgid.2.html">setpgid(2)</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setsid.2.html">setsid(2)</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/sigqueue.3.html">sigqueue(3)</a>, and
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/waitpid.2.html">waitpid(2)</a>.

       A process's PID is preserved across an <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>.

   <b>Parent process ID (PPID)</b>
       A process's parent process ID identifies the process that created
       this process using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fork.2.html">fork(2)</a>.  A process can obtain its PPID using
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getppid.2.html">getppid(2)</a>.  A PPID is represented using the type <i>pid_t</i>.

       A process's PPID is preserved across an <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>.

   <b>Process group ID and session ID</b>
       Each process has a session ID and a process group ID, both
       represented using the type <i>pid_t</i>.  A process can obtain its
       session ID using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getsid.2.html">getsid(2)</a>, and its process group ID using
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getpgrp.2.html">getpgrp(2)</a>.

       A child created by <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fork.2.html">fork(2)</a> inherits its parent's session ID and
       process group ID.  A process's session ID and process group ID
       are preserved across an <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>.

       Sessions and process groups are abstractions devised to support
       shell job control.  A process group (sometimes called a "job") is
       a collection of processes that share the same process group ID;
       the shell creates a new process group for the process(es) used to
       execute single command or pipeline (e.g., the two processes
       created to execute the command "ls | wc" are placed in the same
       process group).  A process's group membership can be set using
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setpgid.2.html">setpgid(2)</a>.  The process whose process ID is the same as its
       process group ID is the <i>process group leader</i> for that group.

       A session is a collection of processes that share the same
       session ID.  All of the members of a process group also have the
       same session ID (i.e., all of the members of a process group
       always belong to the same session, so that sessions and process
       groups form a strict two-level hierarchy of processes.)  A new
       session is created when a process calls <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setsid.2.html">setsid(2)</a>, which creates
       a new session whose session ID is the same as the PID of the
       process that called <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setsid.2.html">setsid(2)</a>.  The creator of the session is
       called the <i>session leader</i>.

       All of the processes in a session share a <i>controlling terminal</i>.
       The controlling terminal is established when the session leader
       first opens a terminal (unless the <b>O_NOCTTY </b>flag is specified
       when calling <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/open.2.html">open(2)</a>).  A terminal may be the controlling
       terminal of at most one session.

       At most one of the jobs in a session may be the <i>foreground job</i>;
       other jobs in the session are <i>background jobs</i>.  Only the
       foreground job may read from the terminal; when a process in the
       background attempts to read from the terminal, its process group
       is sent a <b>SIGTTIN </b>signal, which suspends the job.  If the <b>TOSTOP</b>
       flag has been set for the terminal (see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/termios.3.html">termios(3)</a>), then only
       the foreground job may write to the terminal; writes from
       background job cause a <b>SIGTTOU </b>signal to be generated, which
       suspends the job.  When terminal keys that generate a signal
       (such as the <i>interrupt</i> key, normally control-C) are pressed, the
       signal is sent to the processes in the foreground job.

       Various system calls and library functions may operate on all
       members of a process group, including <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/kill.2.html">kill(2)</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/killpg.3.html">killpg(3)</a>,
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getpriority.2.html">getpriority(2)</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setpriority.2.html">setpriority(2)</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ioprio_get.2.html">ioprio_get(2)</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ioprio_set.2.html">ioprio_set(2)</a>,
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/waitid.2.html">waitid(2)</a>, and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/waitpid.2.html">waitpid(2)</a>.  See also the discussion of the
       <b>F_GETOWN</b>, <b>F_GETOWN_EX</b>, <b>F_SETOWN</b>, and <b>F_SETOWN_EX </b>operations in
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl(2)</a>.

   <b>User and group identifiers</b>
       Each process has various associated user and group IDs.  These
       IDs are integers, respectively represented using the types <i>uid_t</i>
       and <i>gid_t</i> (defined in <i>&lt;sys/types.h&gt;</i>).

       On Linux, each process has the following user and group
       identifiers:

       *  Real user ID and real group ID.  These IDs determine who owns
          the process.  A process can obtain its real user (group) ID
          using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getuid.2.html">getuid(2)</a> (<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getgid.2.html">getgid(2)</a>).

       *  Effective user ID and effective group ID.  These IDs are used
          by the kernel to determine the permissions that the process
          will have when accessing shared resources such as message
          queues, shared memory, and semaphores.  On most UNIX systems,
          these IDs also determine the permissions when accessing files.
          However, Linux uses the filesystem IDs described below for
          this task.  A process can obtain its effective user (group) ID
          using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/geteuid.2.html">geteuid(2)</a> (<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getegid.2.html">getegid(2)</a>).

       *  Saved set-user-ID and saved set-group-ID.  These IDs are used
          in set-user-ID and set-group-ID programs to save a copy of the
          corresponding effective IDs that were set when the program was
          executed (see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>).  A set-user-ID program can assume
          and drop privileges by switching its effective user ID back
          and forth between the values in its real user ID and saved
          set-user-ID.  This switching is done via calls to <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/seteuid.2.html">seteuid(2)</a>,
          <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setreuid.2.html">setreuid(2)</a>, or <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setresuid.2.html">setresuid(2)</a>.  A set-group-ID program performs
          the analogous tasks using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setegid.2.html">setegid(2)</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setregid.2.html">setregid(2)</a>, or
          <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setresgid.2.html">setresgid(2)</a>.  A process can obtain its saved set-user-ID
          (set-group-ID) using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getresuid.2.html">getresuid(2)</a> (<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getresgid.2.html">getresgid(2)</a>).

       *  Filesystem user ID and filesystem group ID (Linux-specific).
          These IDs, in conjunction with the supplementary group IDs
          described below, are used to determine permissions for
          accessing files; see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/path_resolution.7.html">path_resolution(7)</a> for details.  Whenever
          a process's effective user (group) ID is changed, the kernel
          also automatically changes the filesystem user (group) ID to
          the same value.  Consequently, the filesystem IDs normally
          have the same values as the corresponding effective ID, and
          the semantics for file-permission checks are thus the same on
          Linux as on other UNIX systems.  The filesystem IDs can be
          made to differ from the effective IDs by calling <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setfsuid.2.html">setfsuid(2)</a>
          and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setfsgid.2.html">setfsgid(2)</a>.

       *  Supplementary group IDs.  This is a set of additional group
          IDs that are used for permission checks when accessing files
          and other shared resources.  On Linux kernels before 2.6.4, a
          process can be a member of up to 32 supplementary groups;
          since kernel 2.6.4, a process can be a member of up to 65536
          supplementary groups.  The call <i>sysconf(_SC_NGROUPS_MAX)</i> can
          be used to determine the number of supplementary groups of
          which a process may be a member.  A process can obtain its set
          of supplementary group IDs using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getgroups.2.html">getgroups(2)</a>.

       A child process created by <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fork.2.html">fork(2)</a> inherits copies of its
       parent's user and groups IDs.  During an <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>, a process's
       real user and group ID and supplementary group IDs are preserved;
       the effective and saved set IDs may be changed, as described in
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>.

       Aside from the purposes noted above, a process's user IDs are
       also employed in a number of other contexts:

       *  when determining the permissions for sending signals (see
          <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/kill.2.html">kill(2)</a>);

       *  when determining the permissions for setting process-
          scheduling parameters (nice value, real time scheduling policy
          and priority, CPU affinity, I/O priority) using
          <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setpriority.2.html">setpriority(2)</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sched_setaffinity.2.html">sched_setaffinity(2)</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sched_setscheduler.2.html">sched_setscheduler(2)</a>,
          <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sched_setparam.2.html">sched_setparam(2)</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sched_setattr.2.html">sched_setattr(2)</a>, and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ioprio_set.2.html">ioprio_set(2)</a>;

       *  when checking resource limits (see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getrlimit.2.html">getrlimit(2)</a>);

       *  when checking the limit on the number of inotify instances
          that the process may create (see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/inotify.7.html">inotify(7)</a>).

   <b>Modifying process user and group IDs</b>
       Subject to rules described in the relevant manual pages, a
       process can use the following APIs to modify its user and group
       IDs:

       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setuid.2.html">setuid(2)</a> (<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setgid.2.html">setgid(2)</a>)
              Modify the process's real (and possibly effective and
              saved-set) user (group) IDs.

       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/seteuid.2.html">seteuid(2)</a> (<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setegid.2.html">setegid(2)</a>)
              Modify the process's effective user (group) ID.

       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setfsuid.2.html">setfsuid(2)</a> (<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setfsgid.2.html">setfsgid(2)</a>)
              Modify the process's filesystem user (group) ID.

       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setreuid.2.html">setreuid(2)</a> (<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setregid.2.html">setregid(2)</a>)
              Modify the process's real and effective (and possibly
              saved-set) user (group) IDs.

       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setresuid.2.html">setresuid(2)</a> (<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setresgid.2.html">setresgid(2)</a>)
              Modify the process's real, effective, and saved-set user
              (group) IDs.

       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setgroups.2.html">setgroups(2)</a>
              Modify the process's supplementary group list.

       Any changes to a process's effective user (group) ID are
       automatically carried over to the process's filesystem user
       (group) ID.  Changes to a process's effective user or group ID
       can also affect the process "dumpable" attribute, as described in
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/prctl.2.html">prctl(2)</a>.

       Changes to process user and group IDs can affect the capabilities
       of the process, as described in <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html">capabilities(7)</a>.
