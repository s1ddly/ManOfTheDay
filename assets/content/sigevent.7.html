       The <i>sigevent</i> structure is used by various APIs to describe the
       way a process is to be notified about an event (e.g., completion
       of an asynchronous request, expiration of a timer, or the arrival
       of a message).

       The definition shown in the SYNOPSIS is approximate: some of the
       fields in the <i>sigevent</i> structure may be defined as part of a
       union.  Programs should employ only those fields relevant to the
       value specified in <i>sigev_notify</i>.

       The <i>sigev_notify</i> field specifies how notification is to be
       performed.  This field can have one of the following values:

       <b>SIGEV_NONE</b>
              A "null" notification: don't do anything when the event
              occurs.

       <b>SIGEV_SIGNAL</b>
              Notify the process by sending the signal specified in
              <i>sigev_signo</i>.

              If the signal is caught with a signal handler that was
              registered using the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sigaction.2.html">sigaction(2)</a> <b>SA_SIGINFO </b>flag, then
              the following fields are set in the <i>siginfo_t</i> structure
              that is passed as the second argument of the handler:

              <i>si_code</i>
                     This field is set to a value that depends on the
                     API delivering the notification.

              <i>si_signo</i>
                     This field is set to the signal number (i.e., the
                     same value as in <i>sigev_signo</i>).

              <i>si_value</i>
                     This field is set to the value specified in
                     <i>sigev_value</i>.

              Depending on the API, other fields may also be set in the
              <i>siginfo_t</i> structure.

              The same information is also available if the signal is
              accepted using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sigwaitinfo.2.html">sigwaitinfo(2)</a>.

       <b>SIGEV_THREAD</b>
              Notify the process by invoking <i>sigev_notify_function</i> "as
              if" it were the start function of a new thread.  (Among
              the implementation possibilities here are that each timer
              notification could result in the creation of a new thread,
              or that a single thread is created to receive all
              notifications.)  The function is invoked with <i>sigev_value</i>
              as its sole argument.  If <i>sigev_notify_attributes</i> is not
              NULL, it should point to a <i>pthread_attr_t</i> structure that
              defines attributes for the new thread (see
              <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/pthread_attr_init.3.html">pthread_attr_init(3)</a>).

       <b>SIGEV_THREAD_ID </b>(Linux-specific)
              Currently used only by POSIX timers; see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/timer_create.2.html">timer_create(2)</a>.
