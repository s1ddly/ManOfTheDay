       <b>ppdi </b>imports one or more PPD files into a PPD compiler source
       file.  Multiple languages of the same PPD file are merged into a
       single printer definition to facilitate accurate changes for all
       localizations.  <b>This program is deprecated and will be removed in</b>
       <b>a future release of CUPS.</b>
