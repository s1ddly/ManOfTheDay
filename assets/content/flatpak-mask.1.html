       Flatpak maintains a list of patterns that define which refs are
       masked. A masked ref will never be updated or automatically
       installed (for example a masked extension marked auto-download
       will not be downloaded). You can still manually install such
       refs, but once they are installed the version will be pinned.

       The patterns are just a partial ref, with the * character
       matching anything within that part of the ref. Here are some
       example patterns:

           org.some.App
           org.some.App//unstable
           app/org.domain.*
           org.some.App/arm

       To list the current set of masks, run this command without any
       patterns.
