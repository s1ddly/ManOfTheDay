       <b>dh_movefiles </b>is a debhelper program that is responsible for
       moving files out of <i>debian/tmp</i> or some other directory and into
       other package build directories. This may be useful if your
       package has a <i>Makefile</i> that installs everything into <i>debian/tmp</i>,
       and you need to break that up into subpackages.

       Note: <b>dh_install </b>is a much better program, and you are
       recommended to use it instead of <b>dh_movefiles</b>.
