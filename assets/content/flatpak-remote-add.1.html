<pre>
       Adds a remote repository to the flatpak repository configuration.
       NAME is the name for the new remote, and LOCATION is a url or
       pathname. The LOCATION is either a flatpak repository, or a
       .flatpakrepo file which describes a repository. In the former
       case you may also have to specify extra options, such as the gpg
       key for the repo.

       Unless overridden with the <b>--user </b>or <b>--installation </b>options, this
       command changes the default system-wide installation.
