       The <b>mpstat </b>command writes to standard output activities for each
       available processor, processor 0 being the first one.  Global
       average activities among all processors are also reported.  The
       <b>mpstat </b>command can be used on both SMP and UP machines, but in
       the latter, only global average activities will be printed. If no
       activity has been selected, then the default report is the CPU
       utilization report.

       The <i>interval</i> parameter specifies the amount of time in seconds
       between each report.  A value of 0 (or no parameters at all)
       indicates that processors statistics are to be reported for the
       time since system startup (boot). The <i>count</i> parameter can be
       specified in conjunction with the <i>interval</i> parameter if this one
       is not set to zero. The value of <i>count</i> determines the number of
       reports generated at <i>interval</i> seconds apart. If the <i>interval</i>
       parameter is specified without the <i>count</i> parameter, the <b>mpstat</b>
       command generates reports continuously.
