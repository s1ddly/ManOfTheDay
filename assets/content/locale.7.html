<pre>
       A locale is a set of language and cultural rules.  These cover
       aspects such as language for messages, different character sets,
       lexicographic conventions, and so on.  A program needs to be able
       to determine its locale and act accordingly to be portable to
       different cultures.

       The header <i>&lt;locale.h&gt;</i> declares data types, functions, and macros
       which are useful in this task.

       The functions it declares are <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/setlocale.3.html">setlocale(3)</a> to set the current
       locale, and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/localeconv.3.html">localeconv(3)</a> to get information about number
       formatting.

       There are different categories for locale information a program
       might need; they are declared as macros.  Using them as the first
       argument to the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/setlocale.3.html">setlocale(3)</a> function, it is possible to set one
       of these to the desired locale:

       <b>LC_ADDRESS </b>(GNU extension, since glibc 2.2)
              Change settings that describe the formats (e.g., postal
              addresses) used to describe locations and geography-
              related items.  Applications that need this information
              can use <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/nl_langinfo.3.html">nl_langinfo(3)</a> to retrieve nonstandard elements,
              such as <b>_NL_ADDRESS_COUNTRY_NAME </b>(country name, in the
              language of the locale) and <b>_NL_ADDRESS_LANG_NAME</b>
              (language name, in the language of the locale), which
              return strings such as "Deutschland" and "Deutsch" (for
              German-language locales).  (Other element names are listed
              in <i>&lt;langinfo.h&gt;</i>.)

       <b>LC_COLLATE</b>
              This category governs the collation rules used for sorting
              and regular expressions, including character equivalence
              classes and multicharacter collating elements.  This
              locale category changes the behavior of the functions
              <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/strcoll.3.html">strcoll(3)</a> and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/strxfrm.3.html">strxfrm(3)</a>, which are used to compare
              strings in the local alphabet.  For example, the German
              sharp s is sorted as "ss".

       <b>LC_CTYPE</b>
              This category determines the interpretation of byte
              sequences as characters (e.g., single versus multibyte
              characters), character classifications (e.g., alphabetic
              or digit), and the behavior of character classes.  On
              glibc systems, this category also determines the character
              transliteration rules for <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/iconv.1.html">iconv(1)</a> and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/iconv.3.html">iconv(3)</a>.  It
              changes the behavior of the character handling and
              classification functions, such as <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/isupper.3.html">isupper(3)</a> and
              <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/toupper.3.html">toupper(3)</a>, and the multibyte character functions such as
              <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/mblen.3.html">mblen(3)</a> or <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/wctomb.3.html">wctomb(3)</a>.

       <b>LC_IDENTIFICATION </b>(GNU extension, since glibc 2.2)
              Change settings that relate to the metadata for the
              locale.  Applications that need this information can use
              <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/nl_langinfo.3.html">nl_langinfo(3)</a> to retrieve nonstandard elements, such as
              <b>_NL_IDENTIFICATION_TITLE </b>(title of this locale document)
              and <b>_NL_IDENTIFICATION_TERRITORY </b>(geographical territory
              to which this locale document applies), which might return
              strings such as "English locale for the USA" and "USA".
              (Other element names are listed in <i>&lt;langinfo.h&gt;</i>.)

       <b>LC_MONETARY</b>
              This category determines the formatting used for monetary-
              related numeric values.  This changes the information
              returned by <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/localeconv.3.html">localeconv(3)</a>, which describes the way numbers
              are usually printed, with details such as decimal point
              versus decimal comma.  This information is internally used
              by the function <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/strfmon.3.html">strfmon(3)</a>.

       <b>LC_MESSAGES</b>
              This category affects the language in which messages are
              displayed and what an affirmative or negative answer looks
              like.  The GNU C library contains the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/gettext.3.html">gettext(3)</a>,
              <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/ngettext.3.html">ngettext(3)</a>, and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/rpmatch.3.html">rpmatch(3)</a> functions to ease the use of
              this information.  The GNU gettext family of functions
              also obey the environment variable <b>LANGUAGE </b>(containing a
              colon-separated list of locales) if the category is set to
              a valid locale other than <b>"C"</b>.  This category also affects
              the behavior of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/catopen.3.html">catopen(3)</a>.

       <b>LC_MEASUREMENT </b>(GNU extension, since glibc 2.2)
              Change the settings relating to the measurement system in
              the locale (i.e., metric versus US customary units).
              Applications can use <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/nl_langinfo.3.html">nl_langinfo(3)</a> to retrieve the
              nonstandard <b>_NL_MEASUREMENT_MEASUREMENT </b>element, which
              returns a pointer to a character that has the value 1
              (metric) or 2 (US customary units).

       <b>LC_NAME </b>(GNU extension, since glibc 2.2)
              Change settings that describe the formats used to address
              persons.  Applications that need this information can use
              <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/nl_langinfo.3.html">nl_langinfo(3)</a> to retrieve nonstandard elements, such as
              <b>_NL_NAME_NAME_MR </b>(general salutation for men) and
              <b>_NL_NAME_NAME_MS </b>(general salutation for women) elements,
              which return strings such as "Herr" and "Frau" (for
              German-language locales).  (Other element names are listed
              in <i>&lt;langinfo.h&gt;</i>.)

       <b>LC_NUMERIC</b>
              This category determines the formatting rules used for
              nonmonetary numeric valuesâ€”for example, the thousands
              separator and the radix character (a period in most
              English-speaking countries, but a comma in many other
              regions).  It affects functions such as <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/printf.3.html">printf(3)</a>,
              <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/scanf.3.html">scanf(3)</a>, and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/strtod.3.html">strtod(3)</a>.  This information can also be
              read with the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/localeconv.3.html">localeconv(3)</a> function.

       <b>LC_PAPER </b>(GNU extension, since glibc 2.2)
              Change the settings relating to the dimensions of the
              standard paper size (e.g., US letter versus A4).
              Applications that need the dimensions can obtain them by
              using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/nl_langinfo.3.html">nl_langinfo(3)</a> to retrieve the nonstandard
              <b>_NL_PAPER_WIDTH </b>and <b>_NL_PAPER_HEIGHT </b>elements, which
              return <i>int</i> values specifying the dimensions in
              millimeters.

       <b>LC_TELEPHONE </b>(GNU extension, since glibc 2.2)
              Change settings that describe the formats to be used with
              telephone services.  Applications that need this
              information can use <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/nl_langinfo.3.html">nl_langinfo(3)</a> to retrieve nonstandard
              elements, such as <b>_NL_TELEPHONE_INT_PREFIX </b>(international
              prefix used to call numbers in this locale), which returns
              a string such as "49" (for Germany).  (Other element names
              are listed in <i>&lt;langinfo.h&gt;</i>.)

       <b>LC_TIME</b>
              This category governs the formatting used for date and
              time values.  For example, most of Europe uses a 24-hour
              clock versus the 12-hour clock used in the United States.
              The setting of this category affects the behavior of
              functions such as <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/strftime.3.html">strftime(3)</a> and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/strptime.3.html">strptime(3)</a>.

       <b>LC_ALL </b>All of the above.

       If the second argument to <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/setlocale.3.html">setlocale(3)</a> is an empty string, <i>""</i>,
       for the default locale, it is determined using the following
       steps:

       1. If there is a non-null environment variable <b>LC_ALL</b>, the value
          of <b>LC_ALL </b>is used.

       2. If an environment variable with the same name as one of the
          categories above exists and is non-null, its value is used for
          that category.

       3. If there is a non-null environment variable <b>LANG</b>, the value of
          <b>LANG </b>is used.

       Values about local numeric formatting is made available in a
       <i>struct lconv</i> returned by the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/localeconv.3.html">localeconv(3)</a> function, which has
       the following declaration:

           struct lconv {

               /* Numeric (nonmonetary) information */

               char *decimal_point;     /* Radix character */
               char *thousands_sep;     /* Separator for digit groups to left
                                           of radix character */
               char *grouping;     /* Each element is the number of digits in

                                      are further left.  An element with value
                                      CHAR_MAX means that no further grouping
                                      is done.  An element with value 0 means
                                      that the previous element is used for
                                      all groups further left. */

   <b>POSIX.1-2008 extensions to the locale API</b>
       POSIX.1-2008 standardized a number of extensions to the locale
       API, based on implementations that first appeared in version 2.3
       of the GNU C library.  These extensions are designed to address
       the problem that the traditional locale APIs do not mix well with
       multithreaded applications and with applications that must deal
       with multiple locales.

       The extensions take the form of new functions for creating and
       manipulating locale objects (<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/newlocale.3.html">newlocale(3)</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/freelocale.3.html">freelocale(3)</a>,
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/duplocale.3.html">duplocale(3)</a>, and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/uselocale.3.html">uselocale(3)</a>) and various new library functions
       with the suffix "_l" (e.g., <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/toupper_l.3.html">toupper_l(3)</a>) that extend the
       traditional locale-dependent APIs (e.g., <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/toupper.3.html">toupper(3)</a>) to allow the
       specification of a locale object that should apply when executing
       the function.
