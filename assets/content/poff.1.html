       This manual page describes the <b>pon</b>, <b>plog </b>and <b>poff </b>scripts, which
       allow users to control PPP connections.

   <b>pon</b>
       <b>pon</b>, invoked without arguments, runs the <i>/etc/ppp/ppp_on_boot</i>
       file, if it exists and is executable. Otherwise, a PPP connection
       will be started using configuration from <i>/etc/ppp/peers/provider</i>.
       This is the default behaviour unless an <b>isp-name </b>argument is
       given.

       For instance, to use ISP configuration "myisp" run:

              pon myisp

       <b>pon </b>will then use the options file <i>/etc/ppp/peers/myisp</i>.  You can
       pass additional <b>options </b>after the ISP name, too.  <b>pon </b>can be used
       to run multiple, simultaneous PPP connections.

   <b>poff</b>
       <b>poff </b>closes a PPP connection. If more than one PPP connection
       exists, the one named in the argument to <b>poff </b>will be killed,
       e.g.

              poff myprovider2

       will terminate the connection to myprovider2, and leave the PPP
       connections to e.g. "myprovider1" or "myprovider3" up and
       running.

       <b>poff </b>takes the following command line options:

              <b>-r     </b>causes the connection to be redialed after it is
                     dropped.

              <b>-d     </b>toggles the state of pppd's debug option.

              <b>-c     </b>causes <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/pppd.8.html">pppd(8)</a> to renegotiate compression.

              <b>-a     </b>stops all running ppp connections. If the argument
                     <b>isp-name </b>is given it will be ignored.

              <b>-h     </b>displays help information.

              <b>-v     </b>prints the version and exits.

              If no argument is given, <b>poff </b>will stop or signal pppd if
              and only if there is exactly one running. If more than one
              connection is active, it will exit with an error code of
              1.

   <b>plog</b>
       <b>plog </b>shows you the last few lines of <i>/var/log/ppp.log</i>. If that
       file doesn't exist, it shows you the last few lines of your
       <i>/var/log/syslog</i> file, but excluding the lines not generated by
       pppd.  This script makes use of the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/tail.1.html">tail(1)</a> command, so arguments
       that can be passed to <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/tail.1.html">tail(1)</a> can also be passed to <b>plog</b>.

       Note: the <b>plog </b>script can only be used by root or another system
       administrator in group "adm", due to security reasons. Also, to
       have all pppd-generated information in one logfile, that plog can
       show, you need the following line in your <i>/etc/syslog.conf</i> file:

       local2.*       -/var/log/ppp.log
