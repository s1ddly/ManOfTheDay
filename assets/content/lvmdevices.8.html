       The LVM devices file lists devices that lvm can use.  The default
       file is <i>/etc/lvm/devices/system.devices</i>, and the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/lvmdevices.8.html">lvmdevices(8)</a>
       command is used to add or remove device entries.  If the file
       does not exist, or if lvm.conf includes use_devicesfile=0, then
       lvm will not use a devices file.

       To use a device with lvm, add it to the devices file with the
       command lvmdevices --adddev, and to prevent lvm from seeing or
       using a device, remove it from the devices file with lvmdevices
       --deldev.  The vgimportdevices(8) command adds all PVs from a VG
       to the devices file, and updates the VG metadata to include
       device IDs of the PVs.

       Commands that add new devices to the devices file necessarily
       look outside the existing devices file to find the devices being
       added.  pvcreate, vgcreate, and vgextend also look outside the
       devices file to create new PVs and add those PVs to the devices
       file.

       LVM records devices in the devices file using hardware-specific
       IDs, such as the WWID, and attempts to use subsystem-specific IDs
       for virtual device types (which also aim to be as unique and
       stable as possible.) These device IDs are also written in the VG
       metadata.  When no hardware or virtual ID is available, lvm falls
       back using the unstable device name as the device ID.  When
       devnames are used as IDs, lvm performs extra scanning to find
       devices if their devname changes, e.g. after reboot.

       When proper device IDs are used, an lvm command will not look at
       devices outside the devices file, but when devnames are used as a
       fallback, lvm will scan devices outside the devices file to
       locate PVs on renamed devices.  A config setting
       search_for_devnames can be used to control the scanning for
       renamed devname entries.

       Related to the devices file, the new command option --devices
       &lt;devnames&gt; allows a list of devices to be specified for the
       command to use, overriding the devices file.  The listed devices
       act as a sort of devices file in terms of limiting which devices
       lvm will see and use.  Devices that are not listed will appear to
       be missing to the lvm command.

       Multiple devices files can be kept <i>/etc/lvm/devices</i>, which allows
       lvm to be used with different sets of devices.  For example,
       system devices do not need to be exposed to a specific
       application, and the application can use lvm on its own devices
       that are not exposed to the system.  The option --devicesfile
       &lt;filename&gt; is used to select the devices file to use with the
       command.  Without the option set, the default system devices file
       is used.

       Setting --devicesfile "" causes lvm to not use a devices file.

       With no devices file, lvm will use any device on the system, and
       applies the filter to limit the full set of system devices.  With
       a devices file, the regex filter is not used, and the filter
       settings in lvm.conf or the command line are ignored.  The
       vgimportdevices command is one exception which does apply the
       regex filter when looking for a VG to import.

       If a devices file exists, lvm will use it, even if it's empty.
       An empty devices file means lvm will see no devices.

       If the system devices file does not yet exist, the pvcreate or
       vgcreate commands will create it if they see no existing VGs on
       the system.  lvmdevices --addev and vgimportdevices will always
       create a new devices file if it does not yet exist.

       It is recommended to use lvm commands to make changes to the
       devices file to ensure proper updates.

       The device ID and device ID type are included in the VG metadata
       and can be reported with pvs -o deviceid,deviceidtype.  (Note
       that the lvmdevices command does not update VG metadata, but
       subsequent lvm commands modifying the metadata will include the
       device ID.)

       Possible device ID types are:

       • <b>sys_wwid </b>uses the wwid reported by sysfs.  This is the first
         choice for non-virtual devices.

       • <b>sys_serial </b>uses the serial number reported by sysfs.  This is
         the second choice for non-virtual devices.

       • <b>mpath_uuid </b>is used for dm multipath devices, reported by sysfs.

       • <b>crypt_uuid </b>is used for dm crypt devices, reported by sysfs.

       • <b>md_uuid </b>is used for md devices, reported by sysfs.  <b>lvmlv_uuid</b>
         is used if a PV is placed on top of an lvm LV, reported by
         sysfs.

       • <b>loop_file </b>is used for loop devices, the backing file name
         repored by sysfs.

       • <b>devname </b>the device name is used if no other type applies.

       The default choice for device ID type can be overriden using
       lvmdevices --addev --deviceidtype &lt;type&gt;.  If the specified type
       is available for the device it will be used, otherwise the device
       will be added using the type that would otherwise be chosen.
