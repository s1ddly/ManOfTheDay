       The CONFORMING TO section that appears in many manual pages
       identifies various standards to which the documented interface
       conforms.  The following list briefly describes these standards.

       <b>V7     </b>Version 7 (also known as Seventh Edition) UNIX, released
              by AT&amp;T/Bell Labs in 1979.  After this point, UNIX systems
              diverged into two main dialects: BSD and System V.

       <b>4.2BSD </b>This is an implementation standard defined by the 4.2
              release of the <i>Berkeley Software Distribution</i>, released by
              the University of California at Berkeley.  This was the
              first Berkeley release that contained a TCP/IP stack and
              the sockets API.  4.2BSD was released in 1983.

              Earlier major BSD releases included <i>3BSD</i> (1980), <i>4BSD</i>
              (1980), and <i>4.1BSD</i> (1981).

       <b>4.3BSD </b>The successor to 4.2BSD, released in 1986.

       <b>4.4BSD </b>The successor to 4.3BSD, released in 1993.  This was the
              last major Berkeley release.

       <b>System V</b>
              This is an implementation standard defined by AT&amp;T's
              milestone 1983 release of its commercial System V (five)
              release.  The previous major AT&amp;T release was <i>System III</i>,
              released in 1981.

       <b>System V release 2 (SVr2)</b>
              This was the next System V release, made in 1985.  The
              SVr2 was formally described in the <i>System V Interface</i>
              <i>Definition version 1</i> (<i>SVID 1</i>) published in 1985.

       <b>System V release 3 (SVr3)</b>
              This was the successor to SVr2, released in 1986.  This
              release was formally described in the <i>System V Interface</i>
              <i>Definition version 2</i> (<i>SVID 2</i>).

       <b>System V release 4 (SVr4)</b>
              This was the successor to SVr3, released in 1989.  This
              version of System V is described in the "Programmer's
              Reference Manual: Operating System API (Intel processors)"
              (Prentice-Hall 1992, ISBN 0-13-951294-2) This release was
              formally described in the <i>System V Interface Definition</i>
              <i>version 3</i> (<i>SVID 3</i>), and is considered the definitive
              System V release.

       <b>SVID 4 </b>System V Interface Definition version 4, issued in 1995.

       <b>C89    </b>This was the first C language standard, ratified by ANSI
              (American National Standards Institute) in 1989
              (<i>X3.159-1989</i>).  Sometimes this is known as <i>ANSI C</i>, but
              since C99 is also an ANSI standard, this term is
              ambiguous.  This standard was also ratified by ISO
              (International Standards Organization) in 1990 (<i>ISO/IEC</i>
              <i>9899:1990</i>), and is thus occasionally referred to as <i>ISO</i>
              <i>C90</i>.

       <b>C99    </b>This revision of the C language standard was ratified by
              ISO in 1999 (<i>ISO/IEC 9899:1999</i>).  Available online at 
              ⟨<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pagestp://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/standards">http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/standards</a>⟩.

       <b>C11    </b>This revision of the C language standard was ratified by
              ISO in 2011 (<i>ISO/IEC 9899:2011</i>).

              <b>LFS </b>The Large File Summit specification, completed in
              1996.  This specification defined mechanisms that allowed
              32-bit systems to support the use of large files (i.e.,
              64-bit file offsets).  See 
              ⟨<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pagestps://www.opengroup.org/platform/lfs.html">https://www.opengroup.org/platform/lfs.html</a>⟩.

       <b>POSIX.1-1988</b>
              This was the first POSIX standard, ratified by IEEE as
              IEEE Std 1003.1-1988, and subsequently adopted (with minor
              revisions) as an ISO standard in 1990.  The term "POSIX"
              was coined by Richard Stallman.

       <b>POSIX.1-1990</b>
              "Portable Operating System Interface for Computing
              Environments".  IEEE 1003.1-1990 part 1, ratified by ISO
              in 1990 (<i>ISO/IEC 9945-1:1990</i>).

       <b>POSIX.2</b>
              IEEE Std 1003.2-1992, describing commands and utilities,
              ratified by ISO in 1993 (<i>ISO/IEC 9945-2:1993</i>).

       <b>POSIX.1b </b>(formerly known as <i>POSIX.4</i>)
              IEEE Std 1003.1b-1993, describing real-time facilities for
              portable operating systems, ratified by ISO in 1996
              (<i>ISO/IEC 9945-1:1996</i>).

       <b>POSIX.1c  (formerly known as </b><i>POSIX.4a</i><b>)</b>
              IEEE Std 1003.1c-1995, which describes the POSIX threads
              interfaces.

       <b>POSIX.1d</b>
              IEEE Std 1003.1c-1999, which describes additional real-
              time extensions.

       <b>POSIX.1g</b>
              IEEE Std 1003.1g-2000, which describes networking APIs
              (including sockets).

       <b>POSIX.1j</b>
              IEEE Std 1003.1j-2000, which describes advanced real-time
              extensions.

       <b>POSIX.1-1996</b>
              A 1996 revision of POSIX.1 which incorporated POSIX.1b and
              POSIX.1c.

       <b>XPG3   </b>Released in 1989, this was the first release of the X/Open
              Portability Guide to be based on a POSIX standard
              (POSIX.1-1988).  This multivolume guide was developed by
              the X/Open Group, a multivendor consortium.

       <b>XPG4   </b>A revision of the X/Open Portability Guide, released in
              1992.  This revision incorporated POSIX.2.

       <b>XPG4v2 </b>A 1994 revision of XPG4.  This is also referred to as <i>Spec</i>
              <i>1170</i>, where 1170 referred to the number of interfaces
              defined by this standard.

       <b>SUS (SUSv1)</b>
              Single UNIX Specification.  This was a repackaging of
              XPG4v2 and other X/Open standards (X/Open Curses Issue 4
              version 2, X/Open Networking Service (XNS) Issue 4).
              Systems conforming to this standard can be branded <i>UNIX</i>
              <i>95</i>.

       <b>SUSv2  </b>Single UNIX Specification version 2.  Sometimes also
              referred to (incorrectly) as <i>XPG5</i>.  This standard appeared
              in 1997.  Systems conforming to this standard can be
              branded <i>UNIX 98</i>.  See also 
              ⟨<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pagestp://www.unix.org/version2/">http://www.unix.org/version2/</a>⟩.)

       <b>POSIX.1-2001, SUSv3</b>
              This was a 2001 revision and consolidation of the POSIX.1,
              POSIX.2, and SUS standards into a single document,
              conducted under the auspices of the Austin Group 
              ⟨<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pagestp://www.opengroup.org/austin/">http://www.opengroup.org/austin/</a>⟩.  The standard is
              available online at ⟨<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pagestp://www.unix.org/version3/">http://www.unix.org/version3/</a>⟩.

              The standard defines two levels of conformance: <i>POSIX</i>
              <i>conformance</i>, which is a baseline set of interfaces
              required of a conforming system; and <i>XSI Conformance</i>,
              which additionally mandates a set of interfaces (the "XSI
              extension") which are only optional for POSIX conformance.
              XSI-conformant systems can be branded <i>UNIX 03</i>.

              The POSIX.1-2001 document is broken into four parts:

              <b>XBD</b>: Definitions, terms, and concepts, header file
              specifications.

              <b>XSH</b>: Specifications of functions (i.e., system calls and
              library functions in actual implementations).

              <b>XCU</b>: Specifications of commands and utilities (i.e., the
              area formerly described by POSIX.2).

              <b>XRAT</b>: Informative text on the other parts of the standard.

              POSIX.1-2001 is aligned with C99, so that all of the
              library functions standardized in C99 are also
              standardized in POSIX.1-2001.

              The Single UNIX Specification version 3 (SUSv3) comprises
              the Base Specifications containing XBD, XSH, XCU, and XRAT
              as above, plus X/Open Curses Issue 4 version 2 as an extra
              volume that is not in POSIX.1-2001.

              Two Technical Corrigenda (minor fixes and improvements) of
              the original 2001 standard have occurred: TC1 in 2003 and
              TC2 in 2004.

       <b>POSIX.1-2008, SUSv4</b>
              Work on the next revision of POSIX.1/SUS was completed and
              ratified in 2008.  The standard is available online at 
              ⟨<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pagestp://www.unix.org/version4/">http://www.unix.org/version4/</a>⟩.

              The changes in this revision are not as large as those
              that occurred for POSIX.1-2001/SUSv3, but a number of new
              interfaces are added and various details of existing
              specifications are modified.  Many of the interfaces that
              were optional in POSIX.1-2001 become mandatory in the 2008
              revision of the standard.  A few interfaces that are
              present in POSIX.1-2001 are marked as obsolete in
              POSIX.1-2008, or removed from the standard altogether.

              The revised standard is structured in the same way as its
              predecessor.  The Single UNIX Specification version 4
              (SUSv4) comprises the Base Specifications containing XBD,
              XSH, XCU, and XRAT, plus X/Open Curses Issue 7 as an extra
              volume that is not in POSIX.1-2008.

              Again there are two levels of conformance: the baseline
              <i>POSIX Conformance</i>, and <i>XSI Conformance</i>, which mandates an
              additional set of interfaces beyond those in the base
              specification.

              In general, where the CONFORMING TO section of a manual
              page lists POSIX.1-2001, it can be assumed that the
              interface also conforms to POSIX.1-2008, unless otherwise
              noted.

              Technical Corrigendum 1 (minor fixes and improvements) of
              this standard was released in 2013.

              Technical Corrigendum 2 of this standard was released in
              2016.

              Further information can be found on the Austin Group web
              site, ⟨<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pagestp://www.opengroup.org/austin/">http://www.opengroup.org/austin/</a>⟩.

       <b>SUSv4 2016 edition</b>
              This is equivalent to POSIX.1-2008, with the addition of
              Technical Corrigenda 1 and 2 and the XCurses
              specification.

       <b>POSIX.1-2017</b>
              This revision of POSIX is technically identical to
              POSIX.1-2008 with Technical Corrigenda 1 and 2 applied.

       <b>SUSv4 2018 edition</b>
              This is equivalent to POSIX.1-2017, with the addition of
              the XCurses specification.

       The interfaces documented in POSIX.1/SUS are available as manual
       pages under sections 0p (header files), 1p (commands), and 3p
       (functions); thus one can write "man 3p open".
