       The <i>Linux Trace Toolkit: next generation</i> &lt;<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pagestps://lttng.org/">https://lttng.org/</a>&gt; is
       an open source software package used for correlated tracing of
       the Linux kernel, user applications, and user libraries.

       LTTng consists of Linux kernel modules (for Linux kernel tracing)
       and dynamically loaded libraries (for user application and
       library tracing).

       The <b>lttng-crash </b>command-line tool is used to recover and view
       LTTng trace buffers in the event of a system crash.
