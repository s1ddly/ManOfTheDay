<pre>
       Reads the supplied diff output (i.e. "a patch") and applies it to
       files. When running from a subdirectory in a repository, patched
       paths outside the directory are ignored. With the <b>--index </b>option
       the patch is also applied to the index, and with the <b>--cached</b>
       option the patch is only applied to the index. Without these
       options, the command applies the patch only to files, and does
       not require them to be in a Git repository.

       This command applies the patch but does not create a commit. Use
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/git-am.1.html">git-am(1)</a> to create commits from patches generated by
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/git-format-patch.1.html">git-format-patch(1)</a> and/or received by email.
