       Fetch branches and/or tags (collectively, "refs") from one or
       more other repositories, along with the objects necessary to
       complete their histories. Remote-tracking branches are updated
       (see the description of &lt;refspec&gt; below for ways to control this
       behavior).

       By default, any tag that points into the histories being fetched
       is also fetched; the effect is to fetch tags that point at
       branches that you are interested in. This default behavior can be
       changed by using the --tags or --no-tags options or by
       configuring remote.&lt;name&gt;.tagOpt. By using a refspec that fetches
       tags explicitly, you can fetch tags that do not point into
       branches you are interested in as well.

       <i>git fetch</i> can fetch from either a single named repository or URL,
       or from several repositories at once if &lt;group&gt; is given and
       there is a remotes.&lt;group&gt; entry in the configuration file. (See
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/git-config.1.html">git-config(1)</a>).

       When no remote is specified, by default the <b>origin </b>remote will be
       used, unless thereâ€™s an upstream branch configured for the
       current branch.

       The names of refs that are fetched, together with the object
       names they point at, are written to <b>.git/FETCH_HEAD</b>. This
       information may be used by scripts or other git commands, such as
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/git-pull.1.html">git-pull(1)</a>.
