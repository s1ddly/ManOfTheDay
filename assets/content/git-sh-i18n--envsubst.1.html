<pre>
       This is not a command the end user would want to run. Ever. This
       documentation is meant for people who are studying the plumbing
       scripts and/or are writing new ones.

       <i>git sh-i18n--envsubst</i> is Git’s stripped-down copy of the GNU
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/envsubst.1.html">envsubst(1)</a> program that comes with the GNU gettext package. It’s
       used internally by <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/git-sh-i18n.1.html">git-sh-i18n(1)</a> to interpolate the variables
       passed to the <b>eval_gettext </b>function.

       No promises are made about the interface, or that this program
       won’t disappear without warning in the next version of Git. Don’t
       use it.
