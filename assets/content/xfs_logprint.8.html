       <b>xfs_logprint </b>prints the log of an XFS filesystem (see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/xfs.5.html">xfs(5)</a>).
       The <i>device</i> argument is the pathname of the partition or logical
       volume containing the filesystem. The <i>device</i> can be a regular
       file if the <b>-f </b>option is used. The contents of the filesystem
       remain undisturbed.  There are two major modes of operation in
       <b>xfs_logprint</b>.

       One mode is better for filesystem operation debugging.  It is
       called the transactional view and is enabled through the <b>-t</b>
       option. The transactional view prints only the portion of the log
       that pertains to recovery. In other words, it prints out complete
       transactions between the tail and the head. This view tries to
       display each transaction without regard to how they are split
       across log records.

       The second mode starts printing out information from the
       beginning of the log.  Some error blocks might print out in the
       beginning because the last log record usually overlaps the oldest
       log record. A message is printed when the physical end of the log
       is reached and when the logical end of the log is reached. A log
       record view is displayed one record at a time. Transactions that
       span log records may not be decoded fully.
