       The <b>chgpasswd </b>command reads a list of group name and password
       pairs from standard input and uses this information to update a
       set of existing groups. Each line is of the format:

       <i>group_name</i>:<i>password</i>

       By default the supplied password must be in clear-text, and is
       encrypted by <b>chgpasswd</b>.

       The default encryption algorithm can be defined for the system
       with the <b>ENCRYPT_METHOD </b>variable of /etc/login.defs, and can be
       overwritten with the <b>-e</b>, <b>-m</b>, or <b>-c </b>options.

       This command is intended to be used in a large system environment
       where many accounts are created at a single time.
