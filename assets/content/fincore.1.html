       <b>fincore </b>counts pages of file contents being resident in memory
       (in core), and reports the numbers. If an error occurs during
       counting, then an error message is printed to the stderr and
       <b>fincore </b>continues processing the rest of files listed in a
       command line.

       The default output is subject to change. So whenever possible,
       you should avoid using default outputs in your scripts. Always
       explicitly define expected columns by using <b>--output </b><i>columns-list</i>
       in environments where a stable output is required.
