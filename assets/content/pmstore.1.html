       Under certain circumstances, it is useful to be able to modify
       the values of performance metrics, for example to re-initialize
       counters or to assign new values to metrics that act as control
       variables.

       <b>pmstore </b>changes the current values for the nominated instances of
       a single performance metric, as identified by <i>metricname</i> and the
       list of instance identifiers following the <b>-i </b>argument.
       <i>instances</i> must be a single argument, with elements of the list
       separated by commas and/or white space.  By default all instances
       of <i>metricname</i> will be updated.

       Normally <b>pmstore </b>operates on the default Performance Metrics Name
       Space (PMNS), see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/PMNS.5.html">PMNS(5)</a>, however if the <b>-n </b>option is specified
       an alternative namespace is loaded from the file <i>pmnsfile</i>.

       Unless directed to another host by the <b>-h </b>option, <b>pmstore </b>will
       interact with the Performance Metric Collector Daemon (PMCD) on
       the local host.

       The <b>-L </b>option causes <b>pmstore </b>to use a local context to store to
       metrics from PMDAs on the local host without PMCD.  Only some
       metrics are available in this mode.  The <b>-h </b>and <b>-L </b>options are
       mutually exclusive.

       The <b>-f </b>option forces the given value to be stored, even if there
       is no current value set.

       The interpretation of <i>value</i> is dependent on the syntax used in
       its specification and the underlying data type of <i>metricname</i>, as
       follows.

       1.  If the metric has an <b>integer </b>type, then <i>value</i> should be an
           optional leading hyphen, followed either by decimal digits or
           ``0x'' and some hexadecimal digits.  ``0X'' is also
           acceptable in lieu of ``0x''.  See <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/strtol.3.html">strtol(3)</a> and the related
           routines.

       2.  If the metric has a <b>floating point </b>type, then <i>value</i> should be
           either in the form of an integer described above, or a fixed
           point number, or a number in scientific notation.  See
           <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/strtod.3.html">strtod(3)</a>.

       3.  If the metric has a <b>string </b>type, then <i>value</i> is interpreted as
           a literal string of ASCII characters.

       4.  If the metric has any other type (i.e.  <b>PM_TYPE_EVENT </b>or
           <b>PM_TYPE_AGGREGATE</b>) then no encoding of <i>value</i> from the command
           line makes sense, and the values of these metrics cannot be
           modified with <b>pmstore</b>.

       The output reports the old value and the new value for each
       updated instance of the requested metric.

       When using the <b>-L </b>option to fetch metrics from a local context,
       the <b>-K </b>option may be used to control the DSO PMDAs that should be
       made accessible.  The <i>spec</i> argument conforms to the syntax
       described in <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/pmSpecLocalPMDA.3.html">pmSpecLocalPMDA(3)</a>.  More than one <b>-K </b>option may be
       used.

       Normally <b>pmstore </b>will report the old value (as initially
       retrieved using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/pmFetch.3.html">pmFetch(3)</a>) and the new value from the command
       line.  The <b>-F </b>option forces another <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/pmFetch.3.html">pmFetch(3)</a> after the
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/pmStore.3.html">pmStore(3)</a> and the returned value is reported as the new value.
       This is useful in cases where <i>metricname</i> is a metric that
       provides different semantics for the store operation, e.g. to
       increment the current value or reset a counter (independent of
       the <i>value</i> from the command line).
