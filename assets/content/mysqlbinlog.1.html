<pre>
       The server´s binary log consists of files containing “events”
       that describe modifications to database contents. The server
       writes these files in binary format. To display their contents in
       text format, use the <b>mysqlbinlog </b>utility. You can also use
       <b>mysqlbinlog </b>to display the contents of relay log files written by
       a slave server in a replication setup because relay logs have the
       same format as binary logs.

       Invoke <b>mysqlbinlog </b>like this:

           shell&gt; <b>mysqlbinlog [</b><i>options</i><b>] </b><i>log_file</i> <b>...</b>

       For example, to display the contents of the binary log file named
       binlog.000003, use this command:

           shell&gt; <b>mysqlbinlog binlog.0000003</b>

       The output includes events contained in binlog.000003. For
       statement-based logging, event information includes the SQL
       statement, the ID of the server on which it was executed, the
       timestamp when the statement was executed, how much time it took,
       and so forth. For row-based logging, the event indicates a row
       change rather than an SQL statement.

       Events are preceded by header comments that provide additional
       information. For example:

           # at 141
           #100309  9:28:36 server id 123  end_log_pos 245
             Query thread_id=3350  exec_time=11  error_code=0

       In the first line, the number following at indicates the starting
       position of the event in the binary log file.

       The second line starts with a date and time indicating when the
       statement started on the server where the event originated. For
       replication, this timestamp is propagated to slave servers.
       server id is the server_id value of the server where the event
       originated.  end_log_pos indicates where the next event starts
       (that is, it is the end position of the current event + 1).
       thread_id indicates which thread executed the event.  exec_time
       is the time spent executing the event, on a master server. On a
       slave, it is the difference of the end execution time on the
       slave minus the beginning execution time on the master. The
       difference serves as an indicator of how much replication lags
       behind the master.  error_code indicates the result from
       executing the event. Zero means that no error occurred.

       The output from <b>mysqlbinlog </b>can be re-executed (for example, by
       using it as input to <b>mysql</b>) to redo the statements in the log.
       This is useful for recovery operations after a server crash. For
       other usage examples, see the discussion later in this section.

       Normally, you use <b>mysqlbinlog </b>to read binary log files directly
       and apply them to the local MariaDB server. It is also possible
       to read binary logs from a remote server by using the
       <b>--read-from-remote-server </b>option. To read remote binary logs, the
       connection parameter options can be given to indicate how to
       connect to the server. These options are <b>--host</b>, <b>--password</b>,
       <b>--port</b>, <b>--protocol</b>, <b>--socket</b>, and <b>--user</b>; they are ignored except
       when you also use the <b>--read-from-remote-server </b>option.

       <b>mysqlbinlog </b>supports the following options, which can be
       specified on the command line or in the [mysqlbinlog] and
       [client] option file groups.

       •   <b>--help</b>, <b>-?</b>

           Display a help message and exit.

       •   <b>--base64-output=</b><i>value</i>

           This option determines when events should be displayed
           encoded as base-64 strings using BINLOG statements. The
           option has these allowable values (not case sensitive):

           •   AUTO ("automatic") or UNSPEC ("unspecified") displays
               BINLOG statements automatically when necessary (that is,
               for format description events and row events). This is
               the default if no <b>--base64-output </b>option is given.

                   <b>Note</b>
                   Automatic BINLOG display is the only safe behavior if
                   you intend to use the output of <b>mysqlbinlog </b>to
                   re-execute binary log file contents. The other option
                   values are intended only for debugging or testing
                   purposes because they may produce output that does
                   not include all events in executable form.

           •   NEVER causes BINLOG statements not to be displayed.
               <b>mysqlbinlog </b>exits with an error if a row event is found
               that must be displayed using BINLOG.

           •   DECODE-ROWS specifies to <b>mysqlbinlog </b>that you intend for
               row events to be decoded and displayed as commented SQL
               statements by also specifying the <b>--verbose </b>option. Like
               NEVER, DECODE-ROWS suppresses display of BINLOG
               statements, but unlike NEVER, it does not exit with an
               error if a row event is found.
               The <b>--base64-output </b>can be given as <b>--base64-output </b>or
               <b>--skip-base64-output </b>(with the sense of AUTO or NEVER).

               For examples that show the effect of <b>--base64-output </b>and
               <b>--verbose </b>on row event output, see the section called
               “MYSQLBINLOG ROW EVENT DISPLAY”.

       •   <b>--binlog-row-event-max-size=</b><i>path</i>

           The directory where character sets are installed.

       •   <b>--character-sets-dir=</b><i>path</i>

           The directory where character sets are installed.

       •   <b>--database=</b><i>db_name</i>, <b>-d </b><i>db_name</i>

           This option causes <b>mysqlbinlog </b>to output entries from the
           binary log (local log only) that occur while <i>db_name</i> has been
           selected as the default database by USE.

           The <b>--database </b>option for <b>mysqlbinlog </b>is similar to the
           <b>--binlog-do-db </b>option for <b>mysqld</b>, but can be used to specify
           only one database. If <b>--database </b>is given multiple times,
           only the last instance is used.

           The effects of this option depend on whether the
           statement-based or row-based logging format is in use, in the
           same way that the effects of <b>--binlog-do-db </b>depend on whether
           statement-based or row-based logging is in use.

           <b>Statement-based logging</b>. The <b>--database </b>option works as
           follows:

           •   While <i>db_name</i> is the default database, statements are
               output whether they modify tables in <i>db_name</i> or a
               different database.

           •   Unless <i>db_name</i> is selected as the default database,
               statements are not output, even if they modify tables in
               <i>db_name</i>.

           •   There is an exception for CREATE DATABASE, ALTER
               DATABASE, and DROP DATABASE. The database being <i>created,</i>
               <i>altered, or dropped</i> is considered to be the default
               database when determining whether to output the
               statement.
               Suppose that the binary log was created by executing
               these statements using statement-based-logging:

                   INSERT INTO test.t1 (i) VALUES(100);
                   INSERT INTO db2.t2 (j)  VALUES(200);
                   USE test;
                   INSERT INTO test.t1 (i) VALUES(101);
                   INSERT INTO t1 (i)      VALUES(102);
                   INSERT INTO db2.t2 (j)  VALUES(201);
                   USE db2;
                   INSERT INTO test.t1 (i) VALUES(103);
                   INSERT INTO db2.t2 (j)  VALUES(202);
                   INSERT INTO t2 (j)      VALUES(203);

               <b>mysqlbinlog --database=test </b>does not output the first two
               INSERT statements because there is no default database.
               It outputs the three INSERT statements following USE
               test, but not the three INSERT statements following USE
               db2.

               <b>mysqlbinlog --database=db2 </b>does not output the first two
               INSERT statements because there is no default database.
               It does not output the three INSERT statements following
               USE test, but does output the three INSERT statements
               following USE db2.

               <b>Row-based logging</b>.  <b>mysqlbinlog </b>outputs only entries that
               change tables belonging to <i>db_name</i>. The default database
               has no effect on this. Suppose that the binary log just
               described was created using row-based logging rather than
               statement-based logging.  <b>mysqlbinlog --database=test</b>
               outputs only those entries that modify t1 in the test
               database, regardless of whether USE was issued or what
               the default database is.  If a server is running with
               binlog_format set to MIXED and you want it to be possible
               to use <b>mysqlbinlog </b>with the <b>--database </b>option, you must
               ensure that tables that are modified are in the database
               selected by USE. (In particular, no cross-database
               updates should be used.)

                   <b>Note</b>
                   This option did not work correctly for <b>mysqlbinlog</b>
                   with row-based logging prior to MySQL 5.1.37.

       •   <b>--debug[=</b><i>debug_options</i><b>]</b>, <b>-# [</b><i>debug_options</i><b>]</b>

           Write a debugging log. A typical <i>debug_options</i> string is
           ´d:t:o,<i>file_name</i>´. The default is
           ´d:t:o,/tmp/mysqlbinlog.trace´.

       •   <b>--debug-check</b>

           Print some debugging information when the program exits.

       •   <b>--debug-info</b>

           Print debugging information and memory and CPU usage
           statistics when the program exits.

       •   <b>--defaults-extra-file=</b><i>name</i>

           Read this file after the global files are read.

       •   <b>--defaults-file=</b><i>name</i>

           Only read default options from the given file.

       •   <b>--default-auth=</b><i>name</i>

           Default authentication client-side plugin to use.

       •   <b>--disable-log-bin</b>, <b>-D</b>

           Disable binary logging. This is useful for avoiding an
           endless loop if you use the <b>--to-last-log </b>option and are
           sending the output to the same MariaDB server. This option
           also is useful when restoring after a crash to avoid
           duplication of the statements you have logged.

           This option requires that you have the SUPER privilege. It
           causes <b>mysqlbinlog </b>to include a SET sql_log_bin = 0 statement
           in its output to disable binary logging of the remaining
           output. The SET statement is ineffective unless you have the
           SUPER privilege.

       •   <b>--force-if-open</b>

           Force if binlog was not closed properly. Defaults to on; use
           <b>--skip-force-if-open </b>to disable.

       •   <b>--force-read</b>, <b>-f</b>

           With this option, if <b>mysqlbinlog </b>reads a binary log event
           that it does not recognize, it prints a warning, ignores the
           event, and continues. Without this option, <b>mysqlbinlog </b>stops
           if it reads such an event.

       •   <b>--hexdump</b>, <b>-H</b>

           Display a hex dump of the log in comments, as described in
           the section called “MYSQLBINLOG HEX DUMP FORMAT”. The hex
           output can be helpful for replication debugging.

       •   <b>--host=</b><i>host_name</i>, <b>-h </b><i>host_name</i>

           Get the binary log from the MariaDB server on the given host.

       •   <b>--local-load=</b><i>path</i>, <b>-l </b><i>path</i>

           Prepare local temporary files for LOAD DATA INFILE in the
           specified directory.

       •   <b>--no-defaults</b>

           Don't read default options from any option file.

       •   <b>--offset=</b><i>N</i>, <b>-o </b><i>N</i>

           Skip the first <i>N</i> entries in the log.

       •   <b>--open-files-limit=</b><i>NUM</i>

           Sets the open_files_limit variable, which is used to reserve
           file descriptors for <b>mysqlbinlog</b>.

       •   <b>--password[=</b><i>password</i><b>]</b>, <b>-p[</b><i>password</i><b>]</b>

           The password to use when connecting to the server. If you use
           the short option form (<b>-p</b>), you <i>cannot</i> have a space between
           the option and the password. If you omit the <i>password</i> value
           following the <b>--password </b>or <b>-p </b>option on the command line,
           <b>mysqlbinlog </b>prompts for one.

           Specifying a password on the command line should be
           considered insecure. You can use an option file to avoid
           giving the password on the command line.

       •   <b>--plugin-dir=</b><i>dir_name</i>

           Directory for client-side plugins.

       •   <b>--print-defaults</b>

           Print the program argument list from all option files and
           exit.

       •   <b>--port=</b><i>port_num</i>, <b>-P </b><i>port_num</i>

           The TCP/IP port number to use for connecting to a remote
           server, or <b>0 </b>for default to, in order of preference, <b>my.cnf</b>,
           <b>$MYSQL_TCP_PORT</b>, <b>/etc/services</b>, built-in default (3306).
           Forces --protocol=tcp when specified on the command line
           without other connection properties.

       •   <b>--protocol={TCP|SOCKET|PIPE|MEMORY}</b>

           The connection protocol to use for connecting to the server.
           It is useful when the other connection parameters normally
           would cause a protocol to be used other than the one you
           want.

       •   <b>--raw</b>

           Requires <b>-R</b>. Output raw binlog data instead of SQL
           statements. Output files named after server logs.

       •   <b>--read-from-remote-server</b>, <b>-R</b>

           Read the binary log from a MariaDB server rather than reading
           a local log file. Any connection parameter options are
           ignored unless this option is given as well. These options
           are <b>--host</b>, <b>--password</b>, <b>--port</b>, <b>--protocol</b>, <b>--socket</b>, and
           <b>--user</b>.

           This option requires that the remote server be running. It
           works only for binary log files on the remote server, not
           relay log files.

       •   <b>--result-file=</b><i>name</i>, <b>-r </b><i>name</i>

           Direct output to the given file. With --raw this is a prefix
           for the file names.

       •   <b>--rewrite-db=</b><i>name</i>, <b>-r </b><i>name</i>

           Updates to a database with a different name than the
           original.  Example: <b>rewrite-db='from-&gt;to'</b>. For events that
           are binlogged as statements, rewriting the database
           constitutes changing a statement's default database from <i>db1</i>
           <b>to </b><i>db2</i>. There is no statement analysis or rewrite of any
           kind, that is, if one specifies <b>"db1.tbl" </b>in the statement
           explicitly, that occurrence won't be changed to <b>"db2.tbl"</b>.
           Row-based events are rewritten correctly to use the new
           database name. Filtering (e.g. with <b>--database=name</b>) happens
           after the database rewrites have been performed. If you use
           this option on the command line and <b>"&gt;" </b>has a special meaning
           to your command interpreter, quote the value (e.g. <b>--rewrite-</b>
           <b>db="oldname-&gt;newname"</b>.

       •   <b>--server-id=</b><i>id</i>

           Display only those events created by the server having the
           given server ID.

       •   <b>--set-charset=</b><i>charset_name</i>

           Add a SET NAMES <i>charset_name</i> statement to the output to
           specify the character set to be used for processing log
           files.

       •   <b>--short-form</b>, <b>-s</b>

           Display only the statements contained in the log, no extra
           info and no row-based events. This is for testing only, and
           should not be used in production systems. If you want to
           suppress base64-output, consider using <b>--base64-output=never</b>
           instead.

       •   <b>--socket=</b><i>path</i>, <b>-S </b><i>path</i>

           For connections to localhost, the Unix socket file to use,
           or, on Windows, the name of the named pipe to use.  Forces
           --protocol=socket when specified on the command line without
           other connection properties; on Windows, forces
           --protocol=pipe.

       •   <b>--start-datetime=</b><i>datetime</i>

           Start reading the binary log at the first event having a
           timestamp equal to or later than the <i>datetime</i> argument. The
           <i>datetime</i> value is relative to the local time zone on the
           machine where you run <b>mysqlbinlog</b>. The value should be in a
           format accepted for the DATETIME or TIMESTAMP data types. For
           example:

               shell&gt; <b>mysqlbinlog --start-datetime="2014-12-25 11:25:56" binlog.000003</b>

           This option is useful for point-in-time recovery.

       •   <b>--start-position=</b><i>N</i>, <b>-j </b><i>N</i>

           Start reading the binary log at the first event having a
           position equal to or greater than <i>N</i>. This option applies to
           the first log file named on the command line.

           This option is useful for point-in-time recovery.

       •   <b>--stop-datetime=</b><i>datetime</i>

           Stop reading the binary log at the first event having a
           timestamp equal to or later than the <i>datetime</i> argument. This
           option is useful for point-in-time recovery. See the
           description of the <b>--start-datetime </b>option for information
           about the <i>datetime</i> value.

           This option is useful for point-in-time recovery.

       •   <b>--stop-never</b>

           Wait for more data from the server instead of stopping at the
           end of the last log. Implies <b>--to-last-log</b>.

       •   <b>--stop-never-slave-server-id</b>

           The slave server_id used for <b>--read-from-remote-server</b>
           <b>--stop-never</b>.

       •   <b>--stop-position=</b><i>N</i>

           Stop reading the binary log at the first event having a
           position equal to or greater than <i>N</i>. This option applies to
           the last log file named on the command line.

           This option is useful for point-in-time recovery.

       •   <b>--table</b>, <b>-T</b>

           List entries for just this table (local log only).

       •    <b>--to-last-log</b>, <b>-t</b>

           Do not stop at the end of the requested binary log from a
           MariaDB server, but rather continue printing until the end of
           the last binary log. If you send the output to the same
           MariaDB server, this may lead to an endless loop, so this
           option requires <b>--read-from-remote-server</b>.

       •   <b>--user=</b><i>user_name</i>, <b>-u </b><i>user_name</i>

           The MariaDB username to use when connecting to a remote
           server.

       •   <b>--verbose</b>, <b>-v</b>

           Reconstruct row events and display them as commented SQL
           statements. If this option is given twice, the output
           includes comments to indicate column data types and some
           metadata.

           For examples that show the effect of <b>--base64-output </b>and
           <b>--verbose </b>on row event output, see the section called
           “MYSQLBINLOG ROW EVENT DISPLAY”.

       •   <b>--version</b>, <b>-V</b>

           Display version information and exit.

       You can also set the following variable by using <b>--</b><i>var_name</i><b>=</b><i>value</i>
       syntax:

       •   open_files_limit

           Specify the number of open file descriptors to reserve.

       You can pipe the output of <b>mysqlbinlog </b>into the <b>mysql </b>client to
       execute the events contained in the binary log. This technique is
       used to recover from a crash when you have an old backup. For
       example:

           shell&gt; <b>mysqlbinlog binlog.000001 | mysql -u root -p</b>

       Or:

           shell&gt; <b>mysqlbinlog binlog.[0-9]* | mysql -u root -p</b>

       You can also redirect the output of <b>mysqlbinlog </b>to a text file
       instead, if you need to modify the statement log first (for
       example, to remove statements that you do not want to execute for
       some reason). After editing the file, execute the statements that
       it contains by using it as input to the <b>mysql </b>program:

           shell&gt; <b>mysqlbinlog binlog.000001 &gt; tmpfile</b>
           shell&gt; ... <i>edit tmpfile</i> ...
           shell&gt; <b>mysql -u root -p &lt; tmpfile</b>

       When <b>mysqlbinlog </b>is invoked with the <b>--start-position </b>option, it
       displays only those events with an offset in the binary log
       greater than or equal to a given position (the given position
       must match the start of one event). It also has options to stop
       and start when it sees an event with a given date and time. This
       enables you to perform point-in-time recovery using the
       <b>--stop-datetime </b>option (to be able to say, for example, “roll
       forward my databases to how they were today at 10:30 a.m.”).

       If you have more than one binary log to execute on the MariaDB
       server, the safe method is to process them all using a single
       connection to the server. Here is an example that demonstrates
       what may be <i>unsafe</i>:

           shell&gt; <b>mysqlbinlog binlog.000001 | mysql -u root -p # DANGER!!</b>
           shell&gt; <b>mysqlbinlog binlog.000002 | mysql -u root -p # DANGER!!</b>

       Processing binary logs this way using different connections to
       the server causes problems if the first log file contains a
       CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE statement and the second log contains a
       statement that uses the temporary table. When the first <b>mysql</b>
       process terminates, the server drops the temporary table. When
       the second <b>mysql </b>process attempts to use the table, the server
       reports “unknown table.”

       To avoid problems like this, use a <i>single</i> <b>mysql </b>process to
       execute the contents of all binary logs that you want to process.
       Here is one way to do so:

           shell&gt; <b>mysqlbinlog binlog.000001 binlog.000002 | mysql -u root -p</b>

       Another approach is to write all the logs to a single file and
       then process the file:

           shell&gt; <b>mysqlbinlog binlog.000001 &gt;  /tmp/statements.sql</b>
           shell&gt; <b>mysqlbinlog binlog.000002 &gt;&gt; /tmp/statements.sql</b>
           shell&gt; <b>mysql -u root -p -e "source /tmp/statements.sql"</b>

       <b>mysqlbinlog </b>can produce output that reproduces a LOAD DATA INFILE
       operation without the original data file.  <b>mysqlbinlog </b>copies the
       data to a temporary file and writes a LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE
       statement that refers to the file. The default location of the
       directory where these files are written is system-specific. To
       specify a directory explicitly, use the <b>--local-load </b>option.

       Because <b>mysqlbinlog </b>converts LOAD DATA INFILE statements to LOAD
       DATA LOCAL INFILE statements (that is, it adds LOCAL), both the
       client and the server that you use to process the statements must
       be configured with the LOCAL capability enabled.

           <b>Warning</b>
           The temporary files created for LOAD DATA LOCAL statements
           are <i>not</i> automatically deleted because they are needed until
           you actually execute those statements. You should delete the
           temporary files yourself after you no longer need the
           statement log. The files can be found in the temporary file
           directory and have names like <i>original_file_name-#-#</i>.
