       Use <b>sepolicy generate </b>to generate an SELinux policy Module.

       <b>sepolicy generate </b>will create 5 files.

       When specifying a <b>confined application </b>you must specify a path.
       <b>sepolicy generate </b>will use the rpm payload of the application
       along with <b>nm -D APPLICATION </b>to help it generate types and policy
       rules for your policy files.

       <b>Type Enforcing File NAME.te</b>
       This file can be used to define all the types rules for a
       particular domain.

       <i>Note:</i> Policy generated by <b>sepolicy generate </b>will automatically
       add a permissive DOMAIN to your te file.  When you are satisfied
       that your policy works, you need to remove the permissive line
       from the te file to run your domain in enforcing mode.

       <b>Interface File NAME.if</b>
       This file defines the interfaces for the types generated in the
       te file, which can be used by other policy domains.

       <b>File Context NAME.fc</b>
       This file defines the default file context for the system, it
       takes the file types created in the te file and associates file
       paths to the types.  Tools like restorecon and RPM will use these
       paths to put down labels.

       <b>RPM Spec File NAME_selinux.spec</b>
       This file is an RPM SPEC file that can be used to install the
       SELinux policy on to machines and setup the labeling. The spec
       file also installs the interface file and a man page describing
       the policy.  You can use <b>sepolicy manpage -d NAME </b>to generate the
       man page.

       <b>Shell File NAME.sh</b>
       This is a helper shell script to compile, install and fix the
       labeling on your test system.  It will also generate a man page
       based on the installed policy, and compile and build an RPM
       suitable to be installed on other machines

       If a generate is possible, this tool will print out all generate
       paths from the source domain to the target domain
