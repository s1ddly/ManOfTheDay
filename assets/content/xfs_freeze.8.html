       <b>xfs_freeze </b>suspends and resumes access to an XFS filesystem (see
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/xfs.5.html">xfs(5)</a>).

       <b>xfs_freeze </b>halts new access to the filesystem and creates a
       stable image on disk.  <b>xfs_freeze </b>is intended to be used with
       volume managers and hardware RAID devices that support the
       creation of snapshots.

       The <i>mount-point</i> argument is the pathname of the directory where
       the filesystem is mounted.  The filesystem must be mounted to be
       frozen (see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/mount.8.html">mount(8)</a>).

       The <b>-f </b>flag requests the specified XFS filesystem to be frozen
       from new modifications.  When this is selected, all ongoing
       transactions in the filesystem are allowed to complete, new write
       system calls are halted, other calls which modify the filesystem
       are halted, and all dirty data, metadata, and log information are
       written to disk.  Any process attempting to write to the frozen
       filesystem will block waiting for the filesystem to be unfrozen.

       Note that even after freezing, the on-disk filesystem can contain
       information on files that are still in the process of unlinking.
       These files will not be unlinked until the filesystem is unfrozen
       or a clean mount of the snapshot is complete.

       The <b>-u </b>flag is used to un-freeze the filesystem and allow
       operations to continue.  Any filesystem modifications that were
       blocked by the freeze are unblocked and allowed to complete.

       The <b>-V </b>flag prints the version number and exits.

       Unless <b>-V </b>is specified, one of <b>-f </b>or <b>-u </b>must be supplied to
       <b>xfs_freeze</b>.
