       <b>pmdadenki </b>is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
       extracts electricity related performance metrics.

       Currently, metrics from RAPL (on Intel cpus) and battery charge
       values are available, if supported by the hardware.

       <b>-l </b>Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
       <i>denki.log</i> is written in the current directory of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> when
       <b>pmdadenki </b>is started, i.e.  <b>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd</b>.  If the log file
       cannot be created or is not writable, output is written to the
       standard error instead.
