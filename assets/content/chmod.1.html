       This manual page documents the GNU version of <b>chmod</b>.  <b>chmod</b>
       changes the file mode bits of each given file according to <i>mode</i>,
       which can be either a symbolic representation of changes to make,
       or an octal number representing the bit pattern for the new mode
       bits.

       The format of a symbolic mode is [<b>ugoa</b>...][[<b>-+=</b>][<i>perms</i>...]...],
       where <i>perms</i> is either zero or more letters from the set <b>rwxXst</b>,
       or a single letter from the set <b>ugo</b>.  Multiple symbolic modes can
       be given, separated by commas.

       A combination of the letters <b>ugoa </b>controls which users' access to
       the file will be changed: the user who owns it (<b>u</b>), other users
       in the file's group (<b>g</b>), other users not in the file's group (<b>o</b>),
       or all users (<b>a</b>).  If none of these are given, the effect is as
       if (<b>a</b>) were given, but bits that are set in the umask are not
       affected.

       The operator <b>+ </b>causes the selected file mode bits to be added to
       the existing file mode bits of each file; <b>- </b>causes them to be
       removed; and <b>= </b>causes them to be added and causes unmentioned
       bits to be removed except that a directory's unmentioned set user
       and group ID bits are not affected.

       The letters <b>rwxXst </b>select file mode bits for the affected users:
       read (<b>r</b>), write (<b>w</b>), execute (or search for directories) (<b>x</b>),
       execute/search only if the file is a directory or already has
       execute permission for some user (<b>X</b>), set user or group ID on
       execution (<b>s</b>), restricted deletion flag or sticky bit (<b>t</b>).
       Instead of one or more of these letters, you can specify exactly
       one of the letters <b>ugo</b>: the permissions granted to the user who
       owns the file (<b>u</b>), the permissions granted to other users who are
       members of the file's group (<b>g</b>), and the permissions granted to
       users that are in neither of the two preceding categories (<b>o</b>).

       A numeric mode is from one to four octal digits (0-7), derived by
       adding up the bits with values 4, 2, and 1.  Omitted digits are
       assumed to be leading zeros.  The first digit selects the set
       user ID (4) and set group ID (2) and restricted deletion or
       sticky (1) attributes.  The second digit selects permissions for
       the user who owns the file: read (4), write (2), and execute (1);
       the third selects permissions for other users in the file's
       group, with the same values; and the fourth for other users not
       in the file's group, with the same values.

       <b>chmod </b>never changes the permissions of symbolic links; the <b>chmod</b>
       system call cannot change their permissions.  This is not a
       problem since the permissions of symbolic links are never used.
       However, for each symbolic link listed on the command line, <b>chmod</b>
       changes the permissions of the pointed-to file.  In contrast,
       <b>chmod </b>ignores symbolic links encountered during recursive
       directory traversals.
