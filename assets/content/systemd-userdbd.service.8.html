       <b>systemd-userdbd </b>is a system service that multiplexes user/group
       lookups to all local services that provide JSON user/group record
       definitions to the system. In addition it synthesizes JSON
       user/group records from classic UNIX/glibc NSS user/group records
       in order to provide full backwards compatibility. It may also
       pick up statically defined JSON user/group records from drop-in
       files in /etc/userdb/, /run/userdb/, /run/host/userdb/ and
       /usr/lib/userdb/.

       Most of <b>systemd-userdbd</b>'s functionality is accessible through the
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/userdbctl.1.html">userdbctl(1)</a> command.

       The user and group records this service provides access to follow
       the <b>JSON User Records</b><b></b>[1] and <b>JSON Group Record</b><b></b>[2] definitions.
       This service implements the <b>User/Group Record Lookup API via</b>
       <b>Varlink</b><b></b>[3], and multiplexes access other services implementing
       this API, too. It is thus both server and client of this API.

       This service provides three distinct <b>Varlink</b><b></b>[4] services:
       <b>io.systemd.Multiplexer </b>provides a single, unified API for
       querying JSON user and group records. Internally it talks to all
       other user/group record services running on the system in
       parallel and forwards any information discovered. This simplifies
       clients substantially since they need to talk to a single service
       only instead of all of them in parallel.
       <b>io.systemd.NameServiceSwitch </b>provides compatibility with classic
       UNIX/glibc NSS user records, i.e. converts <b>struct passwd </b>and
       <b>struct group </b>records as acquired with APIs such as <b>getpwnam</b>(1) to
       JSON user/group records, thus hiding the differences between the
       services as much as possible.  <b>io.systemd.Dropin </b>makes JSON
       user/group records from the aforementioned drop-in directories
       available.
