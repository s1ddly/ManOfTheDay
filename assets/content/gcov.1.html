       <b>gcov </b>is a test coverage program.  Use it in concert with GCC to
       analyze your programs to help create more efficient, faster
       running code and to discover untested parts of your program.  You
       can use <b>gcov </b>as a profiling tool to help discover where your
       optimization efforts will best affect your code.  You can also
       use <b>gcov </b>along with the other profiling tool, <b>gprof</b>, to assess
       which parts of your code use the greatest amount of computing
       time.

       Profiling tools help you analyze your code's performance.  Using
       a profiler such as <b>gcov </b>or <b>gprof</b>, you can find out some basic
       performance statistics, such as:

       *   how often each line of code executes

       *   what lines of code are actually executed

       *   how much computing time each section of code uses

       Once you know these things about how your code works when
       compiled, you can look at each module to see which modules should
       be optimized.  <b>gcov </b>helps you determine where to work on
       optimization.

       Software developers also use coverage testing in concert with
       testsuites, to make sure software is actually good enough for a
       release.  Testsuites can verify that a program works as expected;
       a coverage program tests to see how much of the program is
       exercised by the testsuite.  Developers can then determine what
       kinds of test cases need to be added to the testsuites to create
       both better testing and a better final product.

       You should compile your code without optimization if you plan to
       use <b>gcov </b>because the optimization, by combining some lines of
       code into one function, may not give you as much information as
       you need to look for `hot spots' where the code is using a great
       deal of computer time.  Likewise, because <b>gcov </b>accumulates
       statistics by line (at the lowest resolution), it works best with
       a programming style that places only one statement on each line.
       If you use complicated macros that expand to loops or to other
       control structures, the statistics are less helpful---they only
       report on the line where the macro call appears.  If your complex
       macros behave like functions, you can replace them with inline
       functions to solve this problem.

       <b>gcov </b>creates a logfile called <i>sourcefile.gcov</i> which indicates how
       many times each line of a source file <i>sourcefile.c</i> has executed.
       You can use these logfiles along with <b>gprof </b>to aid in fine-tuning
       the performance of your programs.  <b>gprof </b>gives timing information
       you can use along with the information you get from <b>gcov</b>.

       <b>gcov </b>works only on code compiled with GCC.  It is not compatible
       with any other profiling or test coverage mechanism.
