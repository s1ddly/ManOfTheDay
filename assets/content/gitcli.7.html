       This manual describes the convention used throughout Git CLI.

       Many commands take revisions (most often "commits", but sometimes
       "tree-ish", depending on the context and command) and paths as
       their arguments. Here are the rules:

       •   Revisions come first and then paths. E.g. in <b>git diff v1.0</b>
           <b>v2.0 arch/x86 include/asm-x86</b>, <b>v1.0 </b>and <b>v2.0 </b>are revisions
           and <b>arch/x86 </b>and <b>include/asm-x86 </b>are paths.

       •   When an argument can be misunderstood as either a revision or
           a path, they can be disambiguated by placing <b>-- </b>between them.
           E.g.  <b>git diff -- HEAD </b>is, "I have a file called HEAD in my
           work tree. Please show changes between the version I staged
           in the index and what I have in the work tree for that file",
           not "show difference between the HEAD commit and the work
           tree as a whole". You can say <b>git diff HEAD -- </b>to ask for the
           latter.

       •   Without disambiguating <b>--</b>, Git makes a reasonable guess, but
           errors out and asking you to disambiguate when ambiguous.
           E.g. if you have a file called HEAD in your work tree, <b>git</b>
           <b>diff HEAD </b>is ambiguous, and you have to say either <b>git diff</b>
           <b>HEAD -- </b>or <b>git diff -- HEAD </b>to disambiguate.

       •   Because <b>-- </b>disambiguates revisions and paths in some
           commands, it cannot be used for those commands to separate
           options and revisions. You can use <b>--end-of-options </b>for this
           (it also works for commands that do not distinguish between
           revisions in paths, in which case it is simply an alias for
           <b>--</b>).

           When writing a script that is expected to handle random
           user-input, it is a good practice to make it explicit which
           arguments are which by placing disambiguating <b>-- </b>at
           appropriate places.

       •   Many commands allow wildcards in paths, but you need to
           protect them from getting globbed by the shell. These two
           mean different things:

               $ git restore *.c
               $ git restore \*.c

           The former lets your shell expand the fileglob, and you are
           asking the dot-C files in your working tree to be overwritten
           with the version in the index. The latter passes the <b>*.c </b>to
           Git, and you are asking the paths in the index that match the
           pattern to be checked out to your working tree. After running
           <b>git add hello.c; rm hello.c</b>, you will <i>not</i> see <b>hello.c </b>in your
           working tree with the former, but with the latter you will.

       •   Just as the filesystem <i>.</i>  (period) refers to the current
           directory, using a <i>.</i>  as a repository name in Git (a
           dot-repository) is a relative path and means your current
           repository.

       Here are the rules regarding the "flags" that you should follow
       when you are scripting Git:

       •   it’s preferred to use the non-dashed form of Git commands,
           which means that you should prefer <b>git foo </b>to <b>git-foo</b>.

       •   splitting short options to separate words (prefer <b>git foo -a</b>
           <b>-b </b>to <b>git foo -ab</b>, the latter may not even work).

       •   when a command-line option takes an argument, use the <i>stuck</i>
           form. In other words, write <b>git foo -oArg </b>instead of <b>git foo</b>
           <b>-o Arg </b>for short options, and <b>git foo --long-opt=Arg </b>instead
           of <b>git foo --long-opt Arg </b>for long options. An option that
           takes optional option-argument must be written in the <i>stuck</i>
           form.

       •   when you give a revision parameter to a command, make sure
           the parameter is not ambiguous with a name of a file in the
           work tree. E.g. do not write <b>git log -1 HEAD </b>but write <b>git</b>
           <b>log -1 HEAD --</b>; the former will not work if you happen to
           have a file called <b>HEAD </b>in the work tree.

       •   many commands allow a long option <b>--option </b>to be abbreviated
           only to their unique prefix (e.g. if there is no other option
           whose name begins with <b>opt</b>, you may be able to spell <b>--opt </b>to
           invoke the <b>--option </b>flag), but you should fully spell them
           out when writing your scripts; later versions of Git may
           introduce a new option whose name shares the same prefix,
           e.g.  <b>--optimize</b>, to make a short prefix that used to be
           unique no longer unique.
