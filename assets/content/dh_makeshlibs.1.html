       <b>dh_makeshlibs </b>is a debhelper program that automatically scans for
       shared libraries, and generates a shlibs file for the libraries
       it finds.

       It will also ensure that ldconfig is invoked during install and
       removal when it finds shared libraries.  Since debhelper
       9.20151004, this is done via a dpkg trigger.  In older versions
       of debhelper, <b>dh_makeshlibs </b>would generate a maintainer script
       for this purpose.

       Since debhelper 12.3, <b>dh_makeshlibs </b>will by default add an
       additional <i>udeb</i> line for udebs in the shlibs file, when the udeb
       has the same name as the deb followed by a "-udeb" suffix (e.g.
       if the deb is called "libfoo1", then debhelper will auto-detect
       the udeb if it is named "libfoo1-udeb"). Please use the
       <b>--add-udeb </b>and <b>--no-add-udeb </b>options below when this auto-
       detection is insufficient.

       If you previously used <b>--add-udeb </b>and are considering to migrate
       to using the new auto-detection feature in 12.3, then please
       remember to test that the resulting <i>DEBIAN/shlibs</i> files are as
       expected.  There are some known corner cases, where the auto-
       detection is insufficient.  These include when the udeb contains
       library files from multiple regular deb packages or when the
       packages do not follow the expected naming convention.
