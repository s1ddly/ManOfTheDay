       The <b>rpc.nfsd </b>program implements the user level part of the NFS
       service. The main functionality is handled by the <b>nfsd </b>kernel
       module. The user space program merely specifies what sort of
       sockets the kernel service should listen on, what NFS versions it
       should support, and how many kernel threads it should use.

       The <b>rpc.mountd </b>server provides an ancillary service needed to
       satisfy mount requests by NFS clients.
