       <b>dcb app </b>is used to configure APP table, or application priority
       table in the DCB (Data Center Bridging) subsystem. The APP table
       is used to assign priority to traffic based on value in one of
       several headers: EtherType, L4 destination port, or DSCP. It also
       allows configuration of port-default priority that is chosen if
       no other prioritization rule applies.

       DCB APP entries are 3-tuples of selector, protocol ID, and
       priority. Selector is an enumeration that picks one of the
       prioritization namespaces. Currently it mostly corresponds to
       configurable parameters described below. Protocol ID is a value
       in the selector namespace. E.g. for EtherType selector, protocol
       IDs are the individual EtherTypes, for DSCP they are individual
       code points. The priority is the priority that should be assigned
       to traffic that matches the selector and protocol ID.

       The APP table is a set of DCB APP entries. The only requirement
       is that duplicate entries are not added. Notably, it is valid to
       have conflicting priority assignment for the same selector and
       protocol ID. For example, the set of two APP entries (DSCP, 10,
       1) and (DSCP, 10, 2), where packets with DSCP of 10 should get
       priority of both 1 and 2, form a well-defined APP table. The <b>dcb</b>
       <b>app </b>tool allows low-level management of the app table by adding
       and deleting individual APP 3-tuples through <b>add </b>and <b>del</b>
       commands. On the other other hand, the command <b>replace </b>does what
       one would typically want in this situation--first adds the new
       configuration, and then removes the obsolete one, so that only
       one prioritization is in effect for a given selector and protocol
       ID.
