       Finalizes a build directory, to prepare it for exporting.
       DIRECTORY is the name of the directory.

       The result of this command is that desktop files, icons and D-Bus
       service files from the files subdirectory are copied to a new
       export subdirectory. In the metadata file, the command key is set
       in the [Application] group, and the supported keys in the
       [Environment] group are set according to the options.

       As part of finalization you can also specify permissions that the
       app needs, using the various options specified below.
       Additionally during finalization the permissions from the runtime
       are inherited into the app unless you specify
       <b>--no-inherit-permissions</b>

       You should review the exported files and the application metadata
       before creating and distributing an application bundle.

       It is an error to run build-finish on a directory that has not
       been initialized as a build directory, or has already been
       finalized.
