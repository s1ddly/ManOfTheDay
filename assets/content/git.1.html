       Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with
       an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level
       operations and full access to internals.

       See <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/gittutorial.7.html">gittutorial(7)</a> to get started, then see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/giteveryday.7.html">giteveryday(7)</a> for a
       useful minimum set of commands. The <b>Git Userâ€™s Manual</b><b></b>[1] has a
       more in-depth introduction.

       After you mastered the basic concepts, you can come back to this
       page to learn what commands Git offers. You can learn more about
       individual Git commands with "git help command". <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/gitcli.7.html">gitcli(7)</a> manual
       page gives you an overview of the command-line command syntax.
