<pre>
       The <i>crontab</i> utility shall create, replace, or edit a user's
       crontab entry; a crontab entry is a list of commands and the
       times at which they shall be executed. The new crontab entry can
       be input by specifying <i>file</i> or input from standard input if no
       <i>file</i> operand is specified, or by using an editor, if <b>-e </b>is
       specified.

       Upon execution of a command from a crontab entry, the
       implementation shall supply a default environment, defining at
       least the following environment variables:

       <i>HOME</i>      A pathname of the user's home directory.

       <i>LOGNAME</i>   The user's login name.

       <i>PATH</i>      A string representing a search path guaranteed to find
                 all of the standard utilities.

       <i>SHELL</i>     A pathname of the command interpreter. When <i>crontab</i> is
                 invoked as specified by this volume of POSIX.1‐2017,
                 the value shall be a pathname for <i>sh</i>.

       The values of these variables when <i>crontab</i> is invoked as
       specified by this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 shall not affect the
       default values provided when the scheduled command is run.

       If standard output and standard error are not redirected by
       commands executed from the crontab entry, any generated output or
       errors shall be mailed, via an implementation-defined method, to
       the user.

       Users shall be permitted to use <i>crontab</i> if their names appear in
       the file <b>cron.allow </b>which is located in an implementation-defined
       directory.  If that file does not exist, the file <b>cron.deny</b>,
       which is located in an implementation-defined directory, shall be
       checked to determine whether the user shall be denied access to
       <i>crontab</i>.  If neither file exists, only a process with appropriate
       privileges shall be allowed to submit a job. If only <b>cron.deny</b>
       exists and is empty, global usage shall be permitted. The
       <b>cron.allow </b>and <b>cron.deny </b>files shall consist of one user name per
       line.
