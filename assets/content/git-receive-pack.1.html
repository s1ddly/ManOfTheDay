       Invoked by <i>git send-pack</i> and updates the repository with the
       information fed from the remote end.

       This command is usually not invoked directly by the end user. The
       UI for the protocol is on the <i>git send-pack</i> side, and the program
       pair is meant to be used to push updates to remote repository.
       For pull operations, see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/git-fetch-pack.1.html">git-fetch-pack(1)</a>.

       The command allows for creation and fast-forwarding of sha1 refs
       (heads/tags) on the remote end (strictly speaking, it is the
       local end <i>git-receive-pack</i> runs, but to the user who is sitting
       at the send-pack end, it is updating the remote. Confused?)

       There are other real-world examples of using update and
       post-update hooks found in the Documentation/howto directory.

       <i>git-receive-pack</i> honours the receive.denyNonFastForwards config
       option, which tells it if updates to a ref should be denied if
       they are not fast-forwards.

       A number of other receive.* config options are available to tweak
       its behavior, see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/git-config.1.html">git-config(1)</a>.
