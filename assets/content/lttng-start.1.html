       The <b>lttng start </b>command starts the various LTTng tracers for a
       given inactive tracing session.

       Starting the LTTng tracers has the effect that all enabled event
       rules within enabled channels can make their target event sources
       <i>emit</i> trace events. Whether they are recorded to the local file
       system, sent over the network, or not recorded at all depends on
       the specific configuration of the tracing session in which
       tracing is started. See <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/lttng-create.1.html">lttng-create(1)</a> for different session
       modes.

       A tracing session with running tracers is said to be <i>active</i>.
       Active tracing sessions can return to the inactive state using
       the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/lttng-stop.1.html">lttng-stop(1)</a> command.

       If <i>SESSION</i> is omitted, the LTTng tracers are started for the
       current tracing session (see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/lttng-create.1.html">lttng-create(1)</a> for more information
       about the current tracing session). Otherwise, they are started
       for the existing tracing session named <i>SESSION</i>. <b>lttng list</b>
       outputs all the existing tracing sessions (see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/lttng-list.1.html">lttng-list(1)</a>).
