       <b>lxc-copy </b>creates and optionally starts (ephemeral or non-
       ephemeral) copies of existing containers.

       <b>lxc-copy </b>creates copies of existing containers. Copies can be
       complete clones of the original container. In this case the whole
       root filesystem of the container is simply copied to the new
       container. Or they can be snapshots, i.e. small copy-on-write
       copies of the original container. In this case the specified
       backing storage for the copy must support snapshots. This
       currently includes btrfs, lvm (lvm devices do not support
       snapshots of snapshots.), overlay, and zfs.

       The copy's backing storage will be of the same type as the
       original container. overlay snapshots of directory backed
       containers are exempted from this rule.

       When the <i>-e</i> flag is specified an ephemeral snapshot of the
       original container is created and started. Ephemeral containers
       will have <b>lxc.ephemeral = 1 </b>set in their config file and will be
       destroyed on shutdown. When <i>-e</i> is used in combination with <i>-D</i> a
       non-ephemeral snapshot of the original container is created and
       started.  Ephemeral containers can also be placed on a tmpfs with
       <i>-t</i> flag. NOTE: If an ephemeral container that is placed on a
       tmpfs is rebooted all changes made to it will currently be lost!

       When <i>-e</i> is specified and no newname is given via <i>-N</i> a random name
       for the snapshot will be chosen.

       Containers created and started with <i>-e</i> can have custom mounts.
       These are specified with the <i>-m</i> flag. Currently two types of
       mounts are supported: <i>bind</i>, and <i>overlay</i>. Mount types are
       specified as suboptions to the <i>-m</i> flag and can be specified
       multiple times separated by commas. <i>overlay</i> mounts are currently
       specified in the format <i>-m overlay=/src:/dest</i>. When no
       destination <i>dest</i> is specified <i>dest</i> will be identical to <i>src</i>.
       Read-only <i>bind</i> mounts are specified <i>-m bind=/src:/dest:ro</i> and
       read-write <i>bind</i> mounts <i>-m bind=/src:/dest:rw</i>. Read-write <i>bind</i>
       mounts are the default and <i>rw</i> can be missing when a read-write
       mount is wanted. When <i>dest</i> is missing <i>dest</i> will be identical to
       <i>src</i>. An example for multiple mounts would be <i>-m</i>
       <i>bind=/src1:/dest1:ro,bind=/src2:ro,overlay=/src3:/dest3</i>.

       The mounts, their options, and formats supported via the <i>-m</i> flag
       are subject to change.
