       The GNU implementation of <i>pic</i> is part of the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/groff.1.html">groff(1)</a> document
       formatting system.  <i>pic</i> is a <i>troff</i>(1) preprocessor that compiles
       descriptions of diagrammatic pictures embedded in <i>troff</i> or TeX
       input files into the language understood by TeX or <i>troff</i>.  It
       copies the contents of each <i>file</i> to the standard output stream,
       except that lines between <b>.PS </b>and either <b>.PE </b>or <b>.PF </b>are
       interpreted as picture descriptions.  Ending a <i>pic</i> picture with
       <b>.PE </b>leaves the page position at the bottom of the picture; ending
       it with <b>.PF </b>leaves the position at the top.  Normally, <i>pic</i> is not
       executed directly by the user, but invoked by specifying the <b>-p</b>
       option to <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/groff.1.html">groff(1)</a>.  If no <i>file</i> operands are given on the command
       line, or if <i>file</i> is “<b>-</b>”, the standard input stream is read.

       It is the user's responsibility to provide appropriate
       definitions of the <b>PS</b>, <b>PE</b>, and <b>PF </b>macros.  When the macro package
       being used does not supply such definitions (for example, old
       versions of -ms), appropriate definitions can be obtained with
       <b>-mpic</b>; these will center each picture.
