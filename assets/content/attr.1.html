       The <i>attr</i> utility allows the manipulation of extended attributes
       associated with filesystem objects from within shell scripts.

       There are four main operations that <i>attr</i> can perform:

       <b>GET    </b>The <b>-g attrname </b>option tells <i>attr</i> to search the named
              object and print (to <i><b>stdout</b></i>) the value associated with
              that attribute name.  With the <b>-q </b>flag, <i><b>stdout</b> </i>will be
              exactly and only the value of the attribute, suitable for
              storage directly into a file or processing via a piped
              command.

       <b>LIST   </b>The <b>-l </b>option tells <i>attr</i> to list the names of all the
              attributes that are associated with the object, and the
              number of bytes in the value of each of those attributes.
              With the <b>-q </b>flag, <i><b>stdout</b> </i>will be a simple list of only the
              attribute names, one per line, suitable for input into a
              script.

       <b>REMOVE </b>The <b>-r attrname </b>option tells <i>attr</i> to remove an attribute
              with the given name from the object if the attribute
              exists.  There is no output on successful completion.

       <b>SET/CREATE</b>
              The <b>-s attrname </b>option tells <i>attr</i> to set the named
              attribute of the object to the value read from <i><b>stdin</b></i>.  If
              an attribute with that name already exists, its value will
              be replaced with this one.  If an attribute with that name
              does not already exist, one will be created with this
              value.  With the <b>-V attrvalue </b>flag, the attribute will be
              set to have a value of <b>attrvalue </b>and <i><b>stdin</b> </i>will not be
              read.  With the <b>-q </b>flag, <i><b>stdout</b> </i>will not be used.  Without
              the <b>-q </b>flag, a message showing the attribute name and the
              entire value will be printed.

       When the <b>-L </b>option is given and the named object is a symbolic
       link, operate on the attributes of the object referenced by the
       symbolic link.  Without this option, operate on the attributes of
       the symbolic link itself.

       When the <b>-R </b>option is given and the process has appropriate
       privileges, operate in the <i>root</i> attribute namespace rather that
       the <i>USER</i> attribute namespace.

       The <b>-S </b>option is similar, except it specifies use of the <i>security</i>
       attribute namespace.

       When the <b>-q </b>option is given <i>attr</i> will try to keep quiet.  It will
       output error messages (to <i><b>stderr</b></i>) but will not print status
       messages (to <i><b>stdout</b></i>).
