<pre>
       The <i>batch</i> utility shall read commands from standard input and
       schedule them for execution in a batch queue. It shall be the
       equivalent of the command:

           at -q b -m now

       where queue <i>b</i> is a special <i>at</i> queue, specifically for batch jobs.
       Batch jobs shall be submitted to the batch queue with no time
       constraints and shall be run by the system using algorithms,
       based on unspecified factors, that may vary with each invocation
       of <i>batch</i>.

       Users shall be permitted to use <i>batch</i> if their name appears in
       the file <b>at.allow </b>which is located in an implementation-defined
       directory.  If that file does not exist, the file <b>at.deny</b>, which
       is located in an implementation-defined directory, shall be
       checked to determine whether the user shall be denied access to
       <i>batch</i>.  If neither file exists, only a process with appropriate
       privileges shall be allowed to submit a job. If only <b>at.deny</b>
       exists and is empty, global usage shall be permitted. The
       <b>at.allow </b>and <b>at.deny </b>files shall consist of one user name per
       line.
