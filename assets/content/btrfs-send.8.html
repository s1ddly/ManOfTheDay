<pre>
       This command will generate a stream of instructions that describe
       changes between two subvolume snapshots. The stream can be
       consumed by the <b>btrfs receive </b>command to replicate the sent
       snapshot on a different filesystem. The command operates in two
       modes: full and incremental.

       All snapshots involved in one send command must be read-only, and
       this status cannot be changed as long as there’s a running send
       operation that uses the snapshot.

       In the full mode, the entire snapshot data and metadata will end
       up in the stream.

       In the incremental mode (options <i>-p</i> and <i>-c</i>), previously sent
       snapshots that are available on both the sending and receiving
       side can be used to reduce the amount of information that has to
       be sent to reconstruct the sent snapshot on a different
       filesystem.

       The <i>-p &lt;parent&gt;</i> option can be omitted when <i>-c &lt;clone-src&gt;</i> options
       are given, in which case <b>btrfs send </b>will determine a suitable
       parent from among the clone sources.

       You must not specify clone sources unless you guarantee that
       these snapshots are exactly in the same state on both sides—both
       for the sender and the receiver.

       <b>Options</b>

       -e
           if sending multiple subvolumes at once, use the new format
           and omit the <i>end cmd</i> marker in the stream separating the
           subvolumes

       -p <i>&lt;parent&gt;</i>
           send an incremental stream from <i>parent</i> to <i>subvol</i>

       -c <i>&lt;clone-src&gt;</i>
           use this snapshot as a clone source for an incremental send
           (multiple allowed)

       -f <i>&lt;outfile&gt;</i>
           output is normally written to standard output so it can be,
           for example, piped to btrfs receive. Use this option to write
           it to a file instead.

       --no-data
           send in <i>NO_FILE_DATA</i> mode

           The output stream does not contain any file data and thus
           cannot be used to transfer changes. This mode is faster and
           is useful to show the differences in metadata. -q|--quiet::::

       <b>Global options</b>

       -q|--quiet
           suppress all messages except errors
