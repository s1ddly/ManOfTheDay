       The <b>oparchive </b>utility is commonly used for collecting profile
       data on a "target" system for future offline analysis on a
       different ("host") machine.  <b>oparchive </b>creates a directory
       populated with executables, libraries, debuginfo files, and
       oprofile sample files. This directory can be tar'ed up and moved
       to another machine to be analyzed without further use of the
       target machine. Using <b>opreport </b>and other post-profiling tools
       against archived data requires the use of the <i>archive:&lt;archived-</i>
       <i>dir&gt;</i> specification. See oprofile(1) for how to write profile
       specifications.  A complete description of offline analysis can
       be found in the chapter titled <i>Analyzing profile data on another</i>
       <i>system (oparchive)</i> of the OProfile user manual. (See the user
       manual URL in the "SEE ALSO" section below.)
