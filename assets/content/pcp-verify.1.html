       <b>pcp-verify </b>inspects various aspects of a PCP collector
       installation and reports on whether it is configured correctly
       for certain modes of operation.

       By default, <b>pcp-verify </b>checks that PMCD is running and no agents
       are in a failed state.  These checks can be extended and refined
       using the command line options.
