       The command finds the most recent tag that is reachable from a
       commit. If the tag points to the commit, then only the tag is
       shown. Otherwise, it suffixes the tag name with the number of
       additional commits on top of the tagged object and the
       abbreviated object name of the most recent commit. The result is
       a "human-readable" object name which can also be used to identify
       the commit to other git commands.

       By default (without --all or --tags) <b>git describe </b>only shows
       annotated tags. For more information about creating annotated
       tags see the -a and -s options to <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/git-tag.1.html">git-tag(1)</a>.

       If the given object refers to a blob, it will be described as
       <b>&lt;commit-ish&gt;:&lt;path&gt;</b>, such that the blob can be found at <b>&lt;path&gt; </b>in
       the <b>&lt;commit-ish&gt;</b>, which itself describes the first commit in
       which this blob occurs in a reverse revision walk from HEAD.
