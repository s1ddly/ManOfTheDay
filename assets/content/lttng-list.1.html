       The <b>lttng list </b>command lists tracing sessions, tracing domains,
       channels, and events.

       Without arguments, <b>lttng list </b>lists the existing tracing sessions
       and shows if they are active or not.

       With one or more of the <b>--kernel</b>, <b>--userspace</b>, <b>--jul</b>, <b>--log4j</b>,
       and <b>--python </b>domain options, the command lists the available
       event sources of the selected domain on the system. The JUL,
       log4j, and Python domains list the names of their available
       <i>loggers</i>. The <b>--syscall </b>option can be used alongside the <b>--kernel</b>
       option to get a list of traceable Linux system calls. The
       <b>--fields </b>option can be used to show the fields of the listed
       event sources.

       Providing a tracing session name <i>SESSION</i> targets a specific
       tracing session. If the <b>--domain </b>option is used, domains
       containing at least one channel in the selected tracing session
       are listed. Otherwise, all the domains, channels, and event rules
       of the selected tracing session are listed along with its details
       (trace path, for example), except when the <b>--channel </b>option is
       used to isolate a specific channel by name.
