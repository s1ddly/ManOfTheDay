<pre>
       The variables whose <i>name</i>s are specified shall be given the
       <i>readonly</i> attribute. The values of variables with the <i>readonly</i>
       attribute cannot be changed by subsequent assignment, nor can
       those variables be unset by the <i>unset</i> utility. If the name of a
       variable is followed by =<i>word</i>, then the value of that variable
       shall be set to <i>word</i>.

       The <i>readonly</i> special built-in shall support the Base Definitions
       volume of POSIX.1‚Äê2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>.

       When <b>-p </b>is specified, <i>readonly</i> writes to the standard output the
       names and values of all read-only variables, in the following
       format:

           "readonly %s=%s\n", &lt;<i>name</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>value</i>&gt;

       if <i>name</i> is set, and

           "readonly %s\n", &lt;<i>name</i>&gt;

       if <i>name</i> is unset.

       The shell shall format the output, including the proper use of
       quoting, so that it is suitable for reinput to the shell as
       commands that achieve the same value and <i>readonly</i> attribute-
       setting results in a shell execution environment in which:

        1. Variables with values at the time they were output do not
           have the <i>readonly</i> attribute set.

        2. Variables that were unset at the time they were output do not
           have a value at the time at which the saved output is reinput
           to the shell.

       When no arguments are given, the results are unspecified.
