       A Babeltrace 2 <b>sink.ctf.fs </b>component writes the messages it
       consumes to one or more CTF (see &lt;<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pagestps://diamon.org/ctf/">https://diamon.org/ctf/</a>&gt;) 1.8
       traces on the file system.

       A <b>sink.ctf.fs </b>component does not merge traces: it writes the
       messages of different input traces to different output traces.

   <b>Special trace IR to CTF translations</b>
       A <b>sink.ctf.fs </b>component makes a best effort to write CTF traces
       that are semantically equivalent to the input traces. As of this
       version, the component writes CTF 1.8 traces, so the following
       field class translations can occur:

       •   The component translates a boolean field class to a CTF
           unsigned 8-bit integer field class.

           The unsigned integer field’s value is 0 when the boolean
           field’s value is false and 1 when the boolean field’s value
           is true.

       •   The component translates a bit array field to a CTF unsigned
           integer field class having the same length.

       •   The component translates an option field class to a CTF
           variant field class where the options are an empty structure
           field class and the optional field class itself.

           The empty structure field is selected when the option field
           has no field.

       In all the cases above, the component adds a comment in the
       metadata stream, above the field class, to indicate that a
       special translation occurred.

   <b>Input message constraints</b>
       Because of limitations in CTF 1.8 regarding how discarded events
       and packets are encoded:

       •   If a stream class supports discarded events and the <b>ignore-</b>
           <b>discarded-events </b>parameter is NOT true:

           •   The stream class must support packets.

           •   Discarded events messages must have times.

           •   Any discarded events message must occur between a packet
               end and a packet beginning message.

           •   The beginning time of a discarded events message must be
               the same as the time of the last packet end message.

           •   The end time of a discarded events message must be the
               same as the time of the next packet end message.

           •   Time ranges of discarded events messages must not
               overlap.

       •   If a stream class supports discarded packets and the <b>ignore-</b>
           <b>discarded-packets </b>parameter is NOT true:

           •   The stream class must support packets.

           •   Discarded packets messages must have times.

           •   The beginning time of a discarded events message must be
               the same as the time of the last packet end message.

           •   The end time of a discarded events message must be the
               same as the time of the next packet beginning message.

           •   Time ranges of discarded packets messages must not
               overlap.

       The messages which a <b>source.ctf.fs </b>component creates satisfy all
       the requirements above.

       If a discarded events or packets message has no events/packets
       count, the <b>sink.ctf.fs </b>component adds 1 to the corresponding CTF
       stream’s counter.

   <b>Alignment and byte order</b>
       A <b>sink.ctf.fs </b>component always aligns data fields as such:

       Integer fields with a size which is not a multiple of 8
           1-bit.

       All other scalar fields (integer, enumeration, real, string)
           8-bit.

       The component writes fields using the machine’s native byte
       order. As of this version, there’s no way to force a custom byte
       order.

   <b>Output path</b>
       The path of a CTF trace is the directory which directly contains
       the metadata and data stream files.

       The current strategy to build a path in which to write the
       streams of a given input trace is, in this order:

        1. If the <b>assume-single-trace </b>parameter is true, then the output
           trace path to use for the single input trace is the directory
           specified by the <b>path </b>parameter.

        2. If the component recognizes the input trace as an LTTng (2.11
           or greater) trace, then it checks specific trace environment
           values to build a trace path relative to the directory
           specified by the <b>path </b>parameter:

           Linux kernel domain

                   <i>HOST</i>/<i>SNAME</i>-<i>STIME</i>/kernel

           User space domain, per-UID buffering

                   <i>HOST</i>/<i>SNAME</i>-<i>STIME</i>/ust/uid/<i>UID</i>/<i>ARCHW</i>-bit

           User space domain, per-PID buffering

                   <i>HOST</i>/<i>SNAME</i>-<i>STIME</i>/ust/pid/<i>PNAME</i>-<i>PID</i>-<i>PTIME</i>

           With:

           <i>HOST</i>
               Target’s hostname.

           <i>SNAME</i>
               Tracing session name.

           <i>STIME</i>
               Tracing session creation date/time.

           <i>UID</i>
               User ID.

           <i>ARCHW</i>
               Architecture’s width (<b>32 </b>or <b>64</b>).

           <i>PNAME</i>
               Process name.

           <i>PID</i>
               Process ID.

           <i>PTIME</i>
               Process’s date/time.

        3. If the input trace has a name, then the component sanitizes
           this name and uses it as a relative path to the directory
           specified by the <b>path </b>parameter.

           The trace name sanitization operation:

           •   Replaces <b>.  </b>subdirectories with <b>_</b>.

           •   Replaces <b>..  </b>subdirectories with <b>__</b>.

           •   Removes any trailing <b>/ </b>character.

        4. The component uses the subdirectory <b>trace </b>relative to the
           directory specified by the <b>path </b>parameter.

       In all the cases above, if the effective output trace path
       already exists on the file system, the component appends a
       numeric suffix to the name of the last subdirectory. The suffix
       starts at 0 and increments until the path does not exist.
