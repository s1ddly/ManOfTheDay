       Invoked by <i>git fetch-pack</i>, learns what objects the other side is
       missing, and sends them after packing.

       This command is usually not invoked directly by the end user. The
       UI for the protocol is on the <i>git fetch-pack</i> side, and the
       program pair is meant to be used to pull updates from a remote
       repository. For push operations, see <i>git send-pack</i>.
