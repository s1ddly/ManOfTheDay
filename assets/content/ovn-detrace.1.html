       The <b>ovn-detrace </b>program reads <b>ovs-appctl ofproto/trace </b>output on
       stdin, looking for flow cookies, and expand each cookie with
       corresponding OVN logical flows. It expands logical flow further
       with the north-bound information e.g. the ACL that generated the
       logical flow, when relevant.
