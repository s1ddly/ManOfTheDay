       systemd-makefs@.service, systemd-mkswap@.service, and
       systemd-growfs@.service are used to implement the
       <b>x-systemd.makefs </b>and <b>x-systemd.growfs </b>options in <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/fstab.5.html">fstab(5)</a>, see
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/systemd.mount.5.html">systemd.mount(5)</a>. They are instantiated for each device for which
       the file system or swap structure needs to be initialized, and
       for each mount point where the file system needs to be grown.

       These services are started at boot, either right before or right
       after the mount point or swap device are used.

       systemd-makefs knows very little about specific file systems and
       swap devices, and after checking that the block device does not
       already contain a file system or other content, it will execute
       binaries specific to each filesystem type (/sbin/mkfs.<i>type</i> or
       /sbin/mkswap).

       systemd-growfs knows very little about specific file systems and
       swap devices, and will instruct the kernel to grow the mounted
       filesystem to full size of the underlying block device.
       Nevertheless, it needs to know the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ioctl.2.html">ioctl(2)</a> number specific to
       each file system, so only certain types are supported. Currently:
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/ext4.5.html">ext4(5)</a>, <b>btrfs</b>(5), <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/xfs.5.html">xfs(5)</a>, and dm-crypt partitions (see
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/cryptsetup.8.html">cryptsetup(8)</a>).

       If the creation of a file system or swap device fails, the mount
       point or swap is failed too. If the growing of a file system
       fails, a warning is emitted.
