       Errors that occur during pass 4 (compilation) have generally only
       a few causes:

       kernel or OS version changes
              The systemtap runtime and embedded-C fragments in the
              tapset library are designed to be portable across a wide
              range of OS versions.  However, incompatibilities can
              occur when some OS changes occur, such as kernel
              modifications that change functions, types, or macros
              referenced by systemtap.  Upstream
              (git://sourceware.org/git/systemtap.git) builds of
              systemtap are often quickly updated to include relevant
              fixes, so try getting or making an updated build.
              Reworded: <b>build systemtap from git for use with very young</b>
              <b>kernels</b>.  If the issue persists, report the problem to the
              systemtap developers.

       buggy embedded-C code
              Embedded-C code in your own guru-mode script cannot be
              checked by systemtap, and is passed through verbatim to
              the compiler.  Errors in such snippets of code may be
              found during the pass-4 compiler invocation, though may be
              hard to identify by the compiler errors.

       incompatible embedded-C code
              The interface standards between systemtap-generated code
              and embedded-C code occasionally change.  For example,
              before version 1.8, arguments were passed using macros
              <i>THIS-&gt;foo</i> and <i>THIS-&gt;__retvalue</i> but from version 1.8
              onward, using <i>STAP_ARG_foo</i> and <i>STAP_RETVALUE</i>.  Adjust your
              embedded-C code to current standards, or use the <i>stap</i>
              <i>--compatible=VERSION</i> option to make systemtap use a
              different one.

       compiler bugs and mysteries
              Messages such as "internal compiler error" suggest
              compiler problems.  These should be reported to the
              compiler developers in the form of a preprocessed <i>.i</i> file,
              plus the compiler command line.  To gather relevant
              information, run

              stap -k --vp 0003 -p4 ....

              Systemtap will report the saved temporary directory, and
              the compiler command line it attempted.  Go to the
              directory to find he main generated file <i>stap_NNNNN_src.c</i>.
              Force the compiler to produce a preprocessed file with:

              make -C /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build M=`pwd` stap_NNNNN_src.i

              (note the <i>.i</i> suffix), and the compiler command line should
              be in the file <i>.stap_NNNNN_src.i.cmd</i>.
