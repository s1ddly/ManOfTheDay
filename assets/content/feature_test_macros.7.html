<pre>
       Feature test macros allow the programmer to control the
       definitions that are exposed by system header files when a
       program is compiled.

       <b>NOTE: </b>In order to be effective, a feature test macro <i>must be</i>
       <i>defined before including any header files</i>.  This can be done
       either in the compilation command (<i>cc -DMACRO=value</i>) or by
       defining the macro within the source code before including any
       headers.  The requirement that the macro must be defined before
       including any header file exists because header files may freely
       include one another.  Thus, for example, in the following lines,
       defining the <b>_GNU_SOURCE </b>macro may have no effect because the
       header <i>&lt;abc.h&gt;</i> itself includes <i>&lt;xyz.h&gt;</i> (POSIX explicitly allows
       this):

           #include &lt;abc.h&gt;
           #define _GNU_SOURCE
           #include &lt;xyz.h&gt;

       Some feature test macros are useful for creating portable
       applications, by preventing nonstandard definitions from being
       exposed.  Other macros can be used to expose nonstandard
       definitions that are not exposed by default.

       The precise effects of each of the feature test macros described
       below can be ascertained by inspecting the <i>&lt;features.h&gt;</i> header
       file.  <b>Note</b>: applications do <i>not</i> need to directly include
       <i>&lt;features.h&gt;</i>; indeed, doing so is actively discouraged.  See
       NOTES.

   <b>Specification of feature test macro requirements in manual pages</b>
       When a function requires that a feature test macro is defined,
       the manual page SYNOPSIS typically includes a note of the
       following form (this example from the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/acct.2.html">acct(2)</a> manual page):

              <b>#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</b>

              <b>int acct(const char *</b><i>filename</i><b>);</b>

          Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
          <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/feature_test_macros.7.html">feature_test_macros(7)</a>):

              <b>acct</b>(): _BSD_SOURCE || (_XOPEN_SOURCE &amp;&amp; _XOPEN_SOURCE &lt;
              500)

       The <b>|| </b>means that in order to obtain the declaration of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/acct.2.html">acct(2)</a>
       from <i>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</i>, <i>either</i> of the following macro definitions must
       be made before including any header files:

           #define _BSD_SOURCE
           #define _XOPEN_SOURCE        /* or any value &lt; 500 */

       Alternatively, equivalent definitions can be included in the
       compilation command:

           cc -D_BSD_SOURCE
           cc -D_XOPEN_SOURCE           # Or any value &lt; 500

       Note that, as described below, <b>some feature test macros are</b>
       <b>defined by default</b>, so that it may not always be necessary to
       explicitly specify the feature test macro(s) shown in the
       SYNOPSIS.

       In a few cases, manual pages use a shorthand for expressing the
       feature test macro requirements (this example from <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/readahead.2.html">readahead(2)</a>):

           <b>#define _GNU_SOURCE</b>
           <b>#include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;</b>

           <b>ssize_t readahead(int </b><i>fd</i><b>, off64_t *</b><i>offset</i><b>, size_t </b><i>count</i><b>);</b>

       This format is employed in cases where only a single feature test
       macro can be used to expose the function declaration, and that
       macro is not defined by default.

   <b>Feature test macros understood by glibc</b>
       The paragraphs below explain how feature test macros are handled
       in glibc 2.<i>x</i>, <i>x</i> &gt; 0.

       First, though, a summary of a few details for the impatient:

       *  The macros that you most likely need to use in modern source
          code are <b>_POSIX_C_SOURCE </b>(for definitions from various
          versions of POSIX.1), <b>_XOPEN_SOURCE </b>(for definitions from
          various versions of SUS), <b>_GNU_SOURCE </b>(for GNU and/or Linux
          specific stuff), and <b>_DEFAULT_SOURCE </b>(to get definitions that
          would normally be provided by default).

       *  Certain macros are defined with default values.  Thus,
          although one or more macros may be indicated as being required
          in the SYNOPSIS of a man page, it may not be necessary to
          define them explicitly.  Full details of the defaults are
          given later in this man page.

       *  Defining <b>_XOPEN_SOURCE </b>with a value of 600 or greater produces
          the same effects as defining <b>_POSIX_C_SOURCE </b>with a value of
          200112L or greater.  Where one sees

              _POSIX_C_SOURCE &gt;= 200112L

          in the feature test macro requirements in the SYNOPSIS of a
          man page, it is implicit that the following has the same
          effect:

              _XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 600

       *  Defining <b>_XOPEN_SOURCE </b>with a value of 700 or greater produces
          the same effects as defining <b>_POSIX_C_SOURCE </b>with a value of
          200809L or greater.  Where one sees

              _POSIX_C_SOURCE &gt;= 200809L

          in the feature test macro requirements in the SYNOPSIS of a
          man page, it is implicit that the following has the same
          effect:

              _XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 700

       Glibc understands the following feature test macros:

       <b>__STRICT_ANSI__</b>
              ISO Standard C.  This macro is implicitly defined by
              <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/gcc.1.html">gcc(1)</a> when invoked with, for example, the <i>-std=c99</i> or
              <i>-ansi</i> flag.

       <b>_POSIX_C_SOURCE</b>
              Defining this macro causes header files to expose
              definitions as follows:

              •  The value 1 exposes definitions conforming to
                 POSIX.1-1990 and ISO C (1990).

              •  The value 2 or greater additionally exposes definitions
                 for POSIX.2-1992.

              •  The value 199309L or greater additionally exposes
                 definitions for POSIX.1b (real-time extensions).

              •  The value 199506L or greater additionally exposes
                 definitions for POSIX.1c (threads).

              •  (Since glibc 2.3.3) The value 200112L or greater
                 additionally exposes definitions corresponding to the
                 POSIX.1-2001 base specification (excluding the XSI
                 extension).  This value also causes C95 (since glibc
                 2.12) and C99 (since glibc 2.10) features to be exposed
                 (in other words, the equivalent of defining
                 <b>_ISOC99_SOURCE</b>).

              •  (Since glibc 2.10) The value 200809L or greater
                 additionally exposes definitions corresponding to the
                 POSIX.1-2008 base specification (excluding the XSI
                 extension).

       <b>_POSIX_SOURCE</b>
              Defining this obsolete macro with any value is equivalent
              to defining <b>_POSIX_C_SOURCE </b>with the value 1.

              Since this macro is obsolete, its usage is generally not
              documented when discussing feature test macro requirements
              in the man pages.

       <b>_XOPEN_SOURCE</b>
              Defining this macro causes header files to expose
              definitions as follows:

              •  Defining with any value exposes definitions conforming
                 to POSIX.1, POSIX.2, and XPG4.

              •  The value 500 or greater additionally exposes
                 definitions for SUSv2 (UNIX 98).

              •  (Since glibc 2.2) The value 600 or greater additionally
                 exposes definitions for SUSv3 (UNIX 03; i.e., the
                 POSIX.1-2001 base specification plus the XSI extension)
                 and C99 definitions.

              •  (Since glibc 2.10) The value 700 or greater
                 additionally exposes definitions for SUSv4 (i.e., the
                 POSIX.1-2008 base specification plus the XSI
                 extension).

              If <b>__STRICT_ANSI__ </b>is not defined, or <b>_XOPEN_SOURCE </b>is
              defined with a value greater than or equal to 500 <i>and</i>
              neither <b>_POSIX_SOURCE </b>nor <b>_POSIX_C_SOURCE </b>is explicitly
              defined, then the following macros are implicitly defined:

              •  <b>_POSIX_SOURCE </b>is defined with the value 1.

              •  <b>_POSIX_C_SOURCE </b>is defined, according to the value of
                 <b>_XOPEN_SOURCE</b>:

                 <b>_XOPEN_SOURCE </b>&lt; 500
                        <b>_POSIX_C_SOURCE </b>is defined with the value 2.

                 500 &lt;= <b>_XOPEN_SOURCE </b>&lt; 600
                        <b>_POSIX_C_SOURCE </b>is defined with the value
                        199506L.

                 600 &lt;= <b>_XOPEN_SOURCE </b>&lt; 700
                        <b>_POSIX_C_SOURCE </b>is defined with the value
                        200112L.

                 700 &lt;= <b>_XOPEN_SOURCE </b>(since glibc 2.10)
                        <b>_POSIX_C_SOURCE </b>is defined with the value
                        200809L.

              In addition, defining <b>_XOPEN_SOURCE </b>with a value of 500 or
              greater produces the same effects as defining
              <b>_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED</b>.

       <b>_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED</b>
              If this macro is defined, <i>and</i> <b>_XOPEN_SOURCE </b>is defined,
              then expose definitions corresponding to the XPG4v2
              (SUSv1) UNIX extensions (UNIX 95).  Defining <b>_XOPEN_SOURCE</b>
              with a value of 500 or more also produces the same effect
              as defining <b>_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED</b>.  Use of
              <b>_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED </b>in new source code should be
              avoided.

              Since defining <b>_XOPEN_SOURCE </b>with a value of 500 or more
              has the same effect as defining <b>_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED</b>,
              the latter (obsolete) feature test macro is generally not
              described in the SYNOPSIS in man pages.

       <b>_ISOC99_SOURCE </b>(since glibc 2.1.3)
              Exposes declarations consistent with the ISO C99 standard.

              Earlier glibc 2.1.x versions recognized an equivalent
              macro named <b>_ISOC9X_SOURCE </b>(because the C99 standard had
              not then been finalized).  Although the use of this macro
              is obsolete, glibc continues to recognize it for backward
              compatibility.

              Defining <b>_ISOC99_SOURCE </b>also exposes ISO C (1990)
              Amendment 1 ("C95") definitions.  (The primary change in
              C95 was support for international character sets.)

              Invoking the C compiler with the option <i>-std=c99</i> produces
              the same effects as defining this macro.

       <b>_ISOC11_SOURCE </b>(since glibc 2.16)
              Exposes declarations consistent with the ISO C11 standard.
              Defining this macro also enables C99 and C95 features
              (like <b>_ISOC99_SOURCE</b>).

              Invoking the C compiler with the option <i>-std=c11</i> produces
              the same effects as defining this macro.

       <b>_LARGEFILE64_SOURCE</b>
              Expose definitions for the alternative API specified by
              the LFS (Large File Summit) as a "transitional extension"
              to the Single UNIX Specification.  (See
              ⟨<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pagestp://opengroup.org/platform/lfs.html">http://opengroup.org/platform/lfs.html</a>⟩.)  The
              alternative API consists of a set of new objects (i.e.,
              functions and types) whose names are suffixed with "64"
              (e.g., <i>off64_t</i> versus <i>off_t</i>, <b>lseek64</b>() versus <b>lseek</b>(),
              etc.).  New programs should not employ this macro; instead
              <i>_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64</i> should be employed.

       <b>_LARGEFILE_SOURCE</b>
              This macro was historically used to expose certain
              functions (specifically <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/fseeko.3.html">fseeko(3)</a> and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/ftello.3.html">ftello(3)</a>) that
              address limitations of earlier APIs (<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/fseek.3.html">fseek(3)</a> and
              <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/ftell.3.html">ftell(3)</a>) that use <i>long</i> for file offsets.  This macro is
              implicitly defined if <b>_XOPEN_SOURCE </b>is defined with a
              value greater than or equal to 500.  New programs should
              not employ this macro; defining <b>_XOPEN_SOURCE </b>as just
              described or defining <b>_FILE_OFFSET_BITS </b>with the value 64
              is the preferred mechanism to achieve the same result.

       <b>_FILE_OFFSET_BITS</b>
              Defining this macro with the value 64 automatically
              converts references to 32-bit functions and data types
              related to file I/O and filesystem operations into
              references to their 64-bit counterparts.  This is useful
              for performing I/O on large files (&gt; 2 Gigabytes) on
              32-bit systems.  (Defining this macro permits correctly
              written programs to use large files with only a
              recompilation being required.)

              64-bit systems naturally permit file sizes greater than 2
              Gigabytes, and on those systems this macro has no effect.

       <b>_BSD_SOURCE </b>(deprecated since glibc 2.20)
              Defining this macro with any value causes header files to
              expose BSD-derived definitions.

              In glibc versions up to and including 2.18, defining this
              macro also causes BSD definitions to be preferred in some
              situations where standards conflict, unless one or more of
              <b>_SVID_SOURCE</b>, <b>_POSIX_SOURCE</b>, <b>_POSIX_C_SOURCE</b>,
              <b>_XOPEN_SOURCE</b>, <b>_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED</b>, or <b>_GNU_SOURCE </b>is
              defined, in which case BSD definitions are disfavored.
              Since glibc 2.19, <b>_BSD_SOURCE </b>no longer causes BSD
              definitions to be preferred in case of conflicts.

              Since glibc 2.20, this macro is deprecated.  It now has
              the same effect as defining <b>_DEFAULT_SOURCE</b>, but generates
              a compile-time warning (unless <b>_DEFAULT_SOURCE </b>is also
              defined).  Use <b>_DEFAULT_SOURCE </b>instead.  To allow code
              that requires <b>_BSD_SOURCE </b>in glibc 2.19 and earlier and
              <b>_DEFAULT_SOURCE </b>in glibc 2.20 and later to compile without
              warnings, define <i>both</i> <b>_BSD_SOURCE </b>and <b>_DEFAULT_SOURCE</b>.

       <b>_SVID_SOURCE </b>(deprecated since glibc 2.20)
              Defining this macro with any value causes header files to
              expose System V-derived definitions.  (SVID == System V
              Interface Definition; see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/standards.7.html">standards(7)</a>.)

              Since glibc 2.20, this macro is deprecated in the same
              fashion as <b>_BSD_SOURCE</b>.

       <b>_DEFAULT_SOURCE </b>(since glibc 2.19)
              This macro can be defined to ensure that the "default"
              definitions are provided even when the defaults would
              otherwise be disabled, as happens when individual macros
              are explicitly defined, or the compiler is invoked in one
              of its "standard" modes (e.g., <i>cc -std=c99</i>).  Defining
              <b>_DEFAULT_SOURCE </b>without defining other individual macros
              or invoking the compiler in one of its "standard" modes
              has no effect.

              The "default" definitions comprise those required by
              POSIX.1-2008 and ISO C99, as well as various definitions
              originally derived from BSD and System V.  On glibc 2.19
              and earlier, these defaults were approximately equivalent
              to explicitly defining the following:

                  cc -D_BSD_SOURCE -D_SVID_SOURCE
              -D_POSIX_C_SOURCE=200809

       <b>_ATFILE_SOURCE </b>(since glibc 2.4)
              Defining this macro with any value causes header files to
              expose declarations of a range of functions with the
              suffix "at"; see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/openat.2.html">openat(2)</a>.  Since glibc 2.10, this macro
              is also implicitly defined if <b>_POSIX_C_SOURCE </b>is defined
              with a value greater than or equal to 200809L.

       <b>_GNU_SOURCE</b>
              Defining this macro (with any value) implicitly defines
              <b>_ATFILE_SOURCE</b>, <b>_LARGEFILE64_SOURCE</b>, <b>_ISOC99_SOURCE</b>,
              <b>_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED</b>, <b>_POSIX_SOURCE</b>, <b>_POSIX_C_SOURCE</b>
              with the value 200809L (200112L in glibc versions before
              2.10; 199506L in glibc versions before 2.5; 199309L in
              glibc versions before 2.1) and <b>_XOPEN_SOURCE </b>with the
              value 700 (600 in glibc versions before 2.10; 500 in glibc
              versions before 2.2).  In addition, various GNU-specific
              extensions are also exposed.

              Since glibc 2.19, defining <b>_GNU_SOURCE </b>also has the effect
              of implicitly defining <b>_DEFAULT_SOURCE</b>.  In glibc versions
              before 2.20, defining <b>_GNU_SOURCE </b>also had the effect of
              implicitly defining <b>_BSD_SOURCE </b>and <b>_SVID_SOURCE</b>.

       <b>_REENTRANT</b>
              Historically, on various C libraries it was necessary to
              define this macro in all multithreaded code.  (Some C
              libraries may still require this.)  In glibc, this macro
              also exposed definitions of certain reentrant functions.

              However, glibc has been thread-safe by default for many
              years; since glibc 2.3, the only effect of defining
              <b>_REENTRANT </b>has been to enable one or two of the same
              declarations that are also enabled by defining
              <b>_POSIX_C_SOURCE </b>with a value of 199606L or greater.

              <b>_REENTRANT </b>is now obsolete.  In glibc 2.25 and later,
              defining <b>_REENTRANT </b>is equivalent to defining
              <b>_POSIX_C_SOURCE </b>with the value 199606L.  If a higher POSIX
              conformance level is selected by any other means (such as
              <b>_POSIX_C_SOURCE </b>itself, <b>_XOPEN_SOURCE</b>, <b>_DEFAULT_SOURCE</b>, or
              <b>_GNU_SOURCE</b>), then defining <b>_REENTRANT </b>has no effect.

              This macro is automatically defined if one compiles with
              <i>cc -pthread</i>.

       <b>_THREAD_SAFE</b>
              Synonym for the (deprecated) <b>_REENTRANT</b>, provided for
              compatibility with some other implementations.

       <b>_FORTIFY_SOURCE </b>(since glibc 2.3.4)
              Defining this macro causes some lightweight checks to be
              performed to detect some buffer overflow errors when
              employing various string and memory manipulation functions
              (for example, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/memcpy.3.html">memcpy(3)</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/memset.3.html">memset(3)</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/stpcpy.3.html">stpcpy(3)</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/strcpy.3.html">strcpy(3)</a>,
              <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/strncpy.3.html">strncpy(3)</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/strcat.3.html">strcat(3)</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/strncat.3.html">strncat(3)</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/sprintf.3.html">sprintf(3)</a>,
              <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/snprintf.3.html">snprintf(3)</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/vsprintf.3.html">vsprintf(3)</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/vsnprintf.3.html">vsnprintf(3)</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/gets.3.html">gets(3)</a>, and wide
              character variants thereof).  For some functions, argument
              consistency is checked; for example, a check is made that
              <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/open.2.html">open(2)</a> has been supplied with a <i>mode</i> argument when the
              specified flags include <b>O_CREAT</b>.  Not all problems are
              detected, just some common cases.

              If <b>_FORTIFY_SOURCE </b>is set to 1, with compiler optimization
              level 1 (<i>gcc -O1</i>) and above, checks that shouldn't change
              the behavior of conforming programs are performed.  With
              <b>_FORTIFY_SOURCE </b>set to 2, some more checking is added, but
              some conforming programs might fail.

              Some of the checks can be performed at compile time (via
              macros logic implemented in header files), and result in
              compiler warnings; other checks take place at run time,
              and result in a run-time error if the check fails.

              Use of this macro requires compiler support, available
              with <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/gcc.1.html">gcc(1)</a> since version 4.0.

   <b>Default definitions, implicit definitions, and combining definitions</b>
       If no feature test macros are explicitly defined, then the
       following feature test macros are defined by default: <b>_BSD_SOURCE</b>
       (in glibc 2.19 and earlier), <b>_SVID_SOURCE </b>(in glibc 2.19 and
       earlier), <b>_DEFAULT_SOURCE </b>(since glibc 2.19), <b>_POSIX_SOURCE</b>, and
       <b>_POSIX_C_SOURCE</b>=200809L (200112L in glibc versions before 2.10;
       199506L in glibc versions before 2.4; 199309L in glibc versions
       before 2.1).

       If any of <b>__STRICT_ANSI__</b>, <b>_ISOC99_SOURCE</b>, <b>_ISOC11_SOURCE </b>(since
       glibc 2.18), <b>_POSIX_SOURCE</b>, <b>_POSIX_C_SOURCE</b>, <b>_XOPEN_SOURCE</b>,
       <b>_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED </b>(in glibc 2.11 and earlier), <b>_BSD_SOURCE</b>
       (in glibc 2.19 and earlier), or <b>_SVID_SOURCE </b>(in glibc 2.19 and
       earlier) is explicitly defined, then <b>_BSD_SOURCE</b>, <b>_SVID_SOURCE</b>,
       and <b>_DEFAULT_SOURCE </b>are not defined by default.

       If <b>_POSIX_SOURCE </b>and <b>_POSIX_C_SOURCE </b>are not explicitly defined,
       and either <b>__STRICT_ANSI__ </b>is not defined or <b>_XOPEN_SOURCE </b>is
       defined with a value of 500 or more, then

       *  <b>_POSIX_SOURCE </b>is defined with the value 1; and

       *  <b>_POSIX_C_SOURCE </b>is defined with one of the following values:

          •  2, if <b>_XOPEN_SOURCE </b>is defined with a value less than 500;

          •  199506L, if <b>_XOPEN_SOURCE </b>is defined with a value greater
             than or equal to 500 and less than 600; or

          •  (since glibc 2.4) 200112L, if <b>_XOPEN_SOURCE </b>is defined with
             a value greater than or equal to 600 and less than 700.

          •  (Since glibc 2.10) 200809L, if <b>_XOPEN_SOURCE </b>is defined
             with a value greater than or equal to 700.

          •  Older versions of glibc do not know about the values
             200112L and 200809L for <b>_POSIX_C_SOURCE</b>, and the setting of
             this macro will depend on the glibc version.

          •  If <b>_XOPEN_SOURCE </b>is undefined, then the setting of
             <b>_POSIX_C_SOURCE </b>depends on the glibc version: 199506L, in
             glibc versions before 2.4; 200112L, in glibc 2.4 to 2.9;
             and 200809L, since glibc 2.10.

       Multiple macros can be defined; the results are additive.
