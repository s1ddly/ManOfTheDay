       <b>pmdapipe </b>is a configurable command output monitoring Performance
       Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA).  It can be seen as analogous to a
       restricted shell, where options can be passed to preset commands,
       and each line of their output is converted into a performance
       event.  These events can be consumed by client tools like
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmval.1.html">pmval(1)</a>.

       The <b>pipe </b>PMDA exports both event-style metrics reflecting
       timestamped event records for text-oriented command output, as
       well as the more orthodox sample-style metrics such as event
       counts and throughput size values.

       The PMDA is configured via a <i>configfile</i> which contains one line
       for each process from which output can be captured, as described
       in the ``CONFIGURATION'' section below.

       A brief description of the <b>pmdapipe </b>command line options follows:

       <b>-c   </b>specifies an alternate configuration file for the PMDA.  By
            default, a file named <i>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/pipe/pipe.conf</i> and any
            files below the <i>$PCP_SYSCONF_DIR/pipe.conf.d/</i> directory are
            used.

       <b>-d   </b>It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics <i>domain</i>
            number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is,
            <i>domain</i> should be different for every PMDA on the one host,
            and the same <i>domain</i> number should be used for the same PMDA
            on all hosts.

       <b>-l   </b>Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
            <i>pipe.log</i> is written in the current directory of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> when
            <b>pmdapipe </b>is started, i.e.  <b>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd</b>.  If the log
            file cannot be created or is not writable, output is written
            to the standard error instead.

       <b>-m   </b>Limit the physical memory used by the PMDA to buffer event
            records to <i>maxsize</i> bytes.  As log events arrive at the PMDA,
            they must be buffered until individual client tools request
            the next batch since their previous batch of events.  The
            default maximum is 2 megabytes.
