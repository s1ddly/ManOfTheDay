       This program replays a typescript, using timing information to
       ensure that output happens in the same rhythm as it originally
       appeared when the script was recorded.

       The replay simply displays the information again; the programs
       that were run when the typescript was being recorded are <b>not run</b>
       <b>again</b>. Since the same information is simply being displayed,
       <b>scriptreplay </b>is only guaranteed to work properly if run on the
       same type of terminal the typescript was recorded on. Otherwise,
       any escape characters in the typescript may be interpreted
       differently by the terminal to which <b>scriptreplay </b>is sending its
       output.

       The timing information is what <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/script.1.html">script(1)</a> outputs to file
       specified by <b>--log-timing</b>.

       By default, the typescript to display is assumed to be named
       <i>typescript</i>, but other filenames may be specified, as the second
       parameter or with option <b>--log-out</b>.

       If the third parameter or <b>--divisor </b>is specified, it is used as a
       speed-up multiplier. For example, a speed-up of 2 makes
       <b>scriptreplay </b>go twice as fast, and a speed-up of 0.1 makes it go
       ten times slower than the original session.
