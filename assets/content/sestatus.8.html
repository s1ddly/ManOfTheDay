       This manual page describes the <b>sestatus </b>program.

       This tool is used to get the status of a system running SELinux.
       It displays data about whether SELinux is enabled or disabled,
       location of key directories, and the loaded policy with its
       status as shown in the example:
              &gt; sestatus
              SELinux status:              enabled
              SELinuxfs mount:             /selinux
              SELinux root directory:      /etc/selinux
              Loaded policy name:          targeted
              Current mode:                permissive
              Mode from config file:       enforcing
              Policy MLS status:           enabled
              Policy deny_unknown status:  allow
              Memory protection checking:  actual (secure)
              Max kernel policy version:   26

       <b>sestatus </b>can also be used to display:

              -   The security context of files and processes listed in
                  the <i>/etc/sestatus.conf</i> file. The format of this file
                  is described in <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/sestatus.conf.5.html">sestatus.conf(5)</a>.

              -   The status of booleans.
