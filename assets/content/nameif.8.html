       <b>nameif </b>renames network interfaces based on mac addresses. When no
       arguments are given <i>/etc/mactab</i> is read. Each line  of it
       contains an interface name and a Ethernet MAC address. Comments
       are allowed starting with #.  Otherwise the interfaces specified
       on the command line are processed.  <i>nameif</i> looks for the
       interface with the given MAC address and renames it to the name
       given.

       When the <i>-s</i> argument is given all error messages go to the
       syslog.

       When the <i>-c</i> argument is given with a file name that file is read
       instead of /etc/mactab.
