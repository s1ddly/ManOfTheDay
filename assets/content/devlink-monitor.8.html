       The <b>devlink </b>utility can monitor the state of devlink devices and
       ports continuously. This option has a slightly different format.
       Namely, the <b>monitor </b>command is the first in the command line and
       then the object list.

       <i>OBJECT-LIST</i> is the list of object types that we want to monitor.
       It may contain <b>dev</b>, <b>port</b>, <b>health</b>, <b>trap</b>, <b>trap-group</b>, <b>trap-policer</b>.

       <b>devlink </b>opens Devlink Netlink socket, listens on it and dumps
       state changes.
