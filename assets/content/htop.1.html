       <b>htop </b>is a cross-platform ncurses-based process viewer.

       It is similar to <b>top</b>, but allows you to scroll vertically and
       horizontally, and interact using a pointing device (mouse).  You
       can observe all processes running on the system, along with their
       command line arguments, as well as view them in a tree format,
       select multiple processes and act on them all at once.

       Tasks related to processes (killing, renicing) can be done
       without entering their PIDs.

       <b>pcp-htop </b>is a version of <b>htop </b>built using the Performance Co-
       Pilot (PCP) Metrics API (see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/PCPIntro.1.html">PCPIntro(1)</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/PMAPI.3.html">PMAPI(3)</a>), allowing to
       extend <b>htop </b>to display values from arbitrary metrics.  See the
       section below titled <b>CONFIG FILES </b>for further details.
