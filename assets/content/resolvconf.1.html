       <b>resolvectl </b>may be used to resolve domain names, IPv4 and IPv6
       addresses, DNS resource records and services with the
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/systemd-resolved.service.8.html">systemd-resolved.service(8)</a> resolver service. By default, the
       specified list of parameters will be resolved as hostnames,
       retrieving their IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. If the parameters
       specified are formatted as IPv4 or IPv6 operation the reverse
       operation is done, and a hostname is retrieved for the specified
       addresses.

       The program's output contains information about the protocol used
       for the look-up and on which network interface the data was
       discovered. It also contains information on whether the
       information could be authenticated. All data for which local
       DNSSEC validation succeeds is considered authenticated. Moreover
       all data originating from local, trusted sources is also reported
       authenticated, including resolution of the local host name, the
       "localhost" hostname or all data from /etc/hosts.
