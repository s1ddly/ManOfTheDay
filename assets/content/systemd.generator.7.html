       Generators are small executables placed in
       /usr/lib/systemd/system-generators/ and other directories listed
       above.  <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/systemd.1.html">systemd(1)</a> will execute these binaries very early at
       bootup and at configuration reload time â€” before unit files are
       loaded. Their main purpose is to convert configuration that is
       not native to the service manager into dynamically generated unit
       files, symlinks or unit file drop-ins, so that they can extend
       the unit file hierarchy the service manager subsequently loads
       and operates on.

       Each generator is called with three directory paths that are to
       be used for generator output. In these three directories,
       generators may dynamically generate unit files (regular ones,
       instances, as well as templates), unit file .d/ drop-ins, and
       create symbolic links to unit files to add additional
       dependencies, create aliases, or instantiate existing templates.
       Those directories are included in the unit load path of
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/systemd.1.html">systemd(1)</a>, allowing generated configuration to extend or
       override existing definitions.

       Directory paths for generator output differ by priority:
       .../generator.early has priority higher than the admin
       configuration in /etc/, while .../generator has lower priority
       than /etc/ but higher than vendor configuration in /usr/, and
       .../generator.late has priority lower than all other
       configuration. See the next section and the discussion of unit
       load paths and unit overriding in <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/systemd.unit.5.html">systemd.unit(5)</a>.

       Generators are loaded from a set of paths determined during
       compilation, as listed above. System and user generators are
       loaded from directories with names ending in system-generators/
       and user-generators/, respectively. Generators found in
       directories listed earlier override the ones with the same name
       in directories lower in the list. A symlink to /dev/null or an
       empty file can be used to mask a generator, thereby preventing it
       from running. Please note that the order of the two directories
       with the highest priority is reversed with respect to the unit
       load path, and generators in /run/ overwrite those in /etc/.

       After installing new generators or updating the configuration,
       <b>systemctl daemon-reload </b>may be executed. This will delete the
       previous configuration created by generators, re-run all
       generators, and cause <b>systemd </b>to reload units from disk. See
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/systemctl.1.html">systemctl(1)</a> for more information.
