       <b>pmdasummary </b>is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
       derives performance metrics values from values made available by
       other PMDAs.  <b>pmdasummary </b>consists of two processes:

       <b>pmie process</b>
              The inference engine for performance values <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmie.1.html">pmie(1)</a> is
              used to periodically sample values for the base metrics
              and compute the derived values.  This process is launched
              with the given <i>pmie-command-line</i> arguments by the main
              process, described below.

       <b>main process</b>
              The main process reads and buffers the values computed by
              <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmie.1.html">pmie(1)</a> and makes them available to the performance
              metrics collector daemon <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a>.

       A brief description of the <b>pmdasummary </b>command line options
       follows:

       <b>-d   </b>It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics <i>domain</i>
            number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is,
            <i>domain</i> should be different for every PMDA on the one host,
            and the same <i>domain</i> number should be used for the same PMDA
            on all hosts.

       <b>-h   </b>This option specifies an alternative help text file <i>helpfile</i>
            for describing the metrics that <b>pmdasummary </b>represents.

       <b>-l   </b>Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
            <i>summary.log</i> is written in the current directory of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a>
            when <b>pmdasummary </b>is started, i.e.  <b>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd</b>.  If
            the log file cannot be created or is not writable, output is
            written to the standard error instead.

       <b>-U   </b>User account under which to run the agent.  The default is
            the unprivileged "pcp" account in current versions of PCP,
            but in older versions the superuser account ("root") was
            used by default.
