       <b>pmlogger_merge </b>is a helper script that is used by
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmlogger_daily.1.html">pmlogger_daily(1)</a> when merging all of the Performance Co-Pilot
       (PCP) archives for a single host on a single day into a combined
       PCP archive.

       <b>pmlogger_merge </b>is a wrapper script for <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmlogextract.1.html">pmlogextract(1)</a> that
       merges all of the archive logs matching the <i>input-basename</i>
       arguments, and creates a new archive using <i>output-name</i> as the
       base name for the physical files that constitute an archive log.
       The <i>input-basename</i> arguments may contain meta characters in the
       style of <b>sh</b>(1).
