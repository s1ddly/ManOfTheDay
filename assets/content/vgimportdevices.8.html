       vgimportdevices adds PVs from a VG to the devices file.  This is
       similar to using using lvmdevices --adddev to add each PV to the
       devices file individually.  vgimportdevices will also update the
       VG metadata to include the device IDs of each PV.
       vgimportdevices will create a new devices file if none exists.

       When a devices file is used, the regex filter is ignored, except
       in the case of vgimportdevices which will apply the regex filter
       when looking for the VGs to import to the devices file.  Use
       vgimportdevices -a to import all VGs on a system to the devices
       file.
