<pre>
       The <i>strings</i> utility shall look for printable strings in regular
       files and shall write those strings to standard output. A
       printable string is any sequence of four (by default) or more
       printable characters terminated by a &lt;newline&gt; or NUL character.
       Additional implementation-defined strings may be written; see
       <i>localedef</i>.

       If the first argument is <b>'-'</b>, the results are unspecified.
