       <b>cfdisk </b>is a curses-based program for partitioning any block
       device. The default device is <i>/dev/sda</i>.

       Note that <b>cfdisk </b>provides basic partitioning functionality with a
       user-friendly interface. If you need advanced features, use
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/fdisk.8.html">fdisk(8)</a> instead.

       All disk label changes will remain in memory only, and the disk
       will be unmodified until you decide to write your changes. Be
       careful before using the write command.

       Since version 2.25 <b>cfdisk </b>supports MBR (DOS), GPT, SUN and SGI
       disk labels, but no longer provides any functionality for CHS
       (Cylinder-Head-Sector) addressing. CHS has never been important
       for Linux, and this addressing concept does not make any sense
       for new devices.

       Since version 2.25 <b>cfdisk </b>also does not provide a 'print' command
       any more. This functionality is provided by the utilities
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/partx.8.html">partx(8)</a> and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/lsblk.8.html">lsblk(8)</a> in a very comfortable and rich way.

       If you want to remove an old partition table from a device, use
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/wipefs.8.html">wipefs(8)</a>.
