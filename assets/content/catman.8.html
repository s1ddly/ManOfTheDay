       <b>catman </b>is used to create an up to date set of pre-formatted
       manual pages known as cat pages.  Cat pages are generally much
       faster to display than the original manual pages, but require
       extra storage space.  The decision to support cat pages is that
       of the local administrator, who must provide suitable directories
       to contain them.

       The options available to <b>catman </b>are the manual page hierarchies
       and sections to pre-format.  The default hierarchies are those
       specified as system hierarchies in the man-db configuration file,
       and the default sections are either the colon-delimited contents
       of the environment variable $<b>MANSECT </b>or the standard set compiled
       into <b>man </b>if $<b>MANSECT </b>is undefined.  Supplying <b>catman </b>with a set
       of whitespace-delimited section names will override both of the
       above.

       <b>catman </b>makes use of the <b>index </b>database cache associated with each
       hierarchy to determine which files need to be formatted.
