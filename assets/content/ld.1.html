       <b>ld </b>combines a number of object and archive files, relocates their
       data and ties up symbol references. Usually the last step in
       compiling a program is to run <b>ld</b>.

       <b>ld </b>accepts Linker Command Language files written in a superset of
       AT&amp;T's Link Editor Command Language syntax, to provide explicit
       and total control over the linking process.

       This man page does not describe the command language; see the <b>ld</b>
       entry in "info" for full details on the command language and on
       other aspects of the GNU linker.

       This version of <b>ld </b>uses the general purpose BFD libraries to
       operate on object files. This allows <b>ld </b>to read, combine, and
       write object files in many different formats---for example, COFF
       or "a.out".  Different formats may be linked together to produce
       any available kind of object file.

       Aside from its flexibility, the GNU linker is more helpful than
       other linkers in providing diagnostic information.  Many linkers
       abandon execution immediately upon encountering an error;
       whenever possible, <b>ld </b>continues executing, allowing you to
       identify other errors (or, in some cases, to get an output file
       in spite of the error).

       The GNU linker <b>ld </b>is meant to cover a broad range of situations,
       and to be as compatible as possible with other linkers.  As a
       result, you have many choices to control its behavior.
