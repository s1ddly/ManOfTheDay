       This command shows the differences between two versions of a
       patch series, or more generally, two commit ranges (ignoring
       merge commits).

       To that end, it first finds pairs of commits from both commit
       ranges that correspond with each other. Two commits are said to
       correspond when the diff between their patches (i.e. the author
       information, the commit message and the commit diff) is
       reasonably small compared to the patches' size. See ``Algorithm``
       below for details.

       Finally, the list of matching commits is shown in the order of
       the second commit range, with unmatched commits being inserted
       just after all of their ancestors have been shown.

       There are three ways to specify the commit ranges:

       •   <b>&lt;range1&gt; &lt;range2&gt;</b>: Either commit range can be of the form
           <b>&lt;base&gt;..&lt;rev&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;rev&gt;^!  </b>or <b>&lt;rev&gt;^-&lt;n&gt;</b>. See <b>SPECIFYING RANGES</b>
           in <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/gitrevisions.7.html">gitrevisions(7)</a> for more details.

       •   <b>&lt;rev1&gt;...&lt;rev2&gt;</b>. This is equivalent to <b>&lt;rev2&gt;..&lt;rev1&gt;</b>
           <b>&lt;rev1&gt;..&lt;rev2&gt;</b>.

       •   <b>&lt;base&gt; &lt;rev1&gt; &lt;rev2&gt;</b>: This is equivalent to <b>&lt;base&gt;..&lt;rev1&gt;</b>
           <b>&lt;base&gt;..&lt;rev2&gt;</b>.
