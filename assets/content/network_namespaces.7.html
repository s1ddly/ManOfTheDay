       Network namespaces provide isolation of the system resources
       associated with networking: network devices, IPv4 and IPv6
       protocol stacks, IP routing tables, firewall rules, the <i>/proc/net</i>
       directory (which is a symbolic link to <i>/proc/PID/net</i>), the
       <i>/sys/class/net</i> directory, various files under <i>/proc/sys/net</i>, port
       numbers (sockets), and so on.  In addition, network namespaces
       isolate the UNIX domain abstract socket namespace (see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/unix.7.html">unix(7)</a>).

       A physical network device can live in exactly one network
       namespace.  When a network namespace is freed (i.e., when the
       last process in the namespace terminates), its physical network
       devices are moved back to the initial network namespace (not to
       the parent of the process).

       A virtual network (<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man4/veth.4.html">veth(4)</a>) device pair provides a pipe-like
       abstraction that can be used to create tunnels between network
       namespaces, and can be used to create a bridge to a physical
       network device in another namespace.  When a namespace is freed,
       the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man4/veth.4.html">veth(4)</a> devices that it contains are destroyed.

       Use of network namespaces requires a kernel that is configured
       with the <b>CONFIG_NET_NS </b>option.
