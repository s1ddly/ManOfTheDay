       Files on cramfs file systems are zlib-compressed one page at a
       time to allow random read access. The metadata is not compressed,
       but is expressed in a terse representation that is more
       space-efficient than conventional file systems.

       The file system is intentionally read-only to simplify its
       design; random write access for compressed files is difficult to
       implement. cramfs ships with a utility (<b>mkcramfs</b>(8)) to pack
       files into new cramfs images.

       File sizes are limited to less than 16 MB.

       Maximum file system size is a little under 272 MB. (The last file
       on the file system must begin before the 256 MB block, but can
       extend past it.)
