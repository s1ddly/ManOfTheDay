       The RADIUS plugin for pppd permits pppd to perform PAP, CHAP, MS-
       CHAP and MS-CHAPv2 authentication against a RADIUS server instead
       of the usual <i>/etc/ppp/pap-secrets</i> and <i>/etc/ppp/chap-secrets</i>
       files.

       The RADIUS plugin is built on a library called <b>radiusclient </b>which
       has its own configuration files (usually in <i>/etc/radiusclient</i>),
       consult those files for more information on configuring the
       RADIUS plugin
