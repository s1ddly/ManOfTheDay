       <b>Rsyslogd </b>is a system utility providing support for message
       logging.  Support of both internet and unix domain sockets
       enables this utility to support both local and remote logging.

       <b>Note that this version of rsyslog ships with extensive</b>
       <b>documentation in HTML format.  </b>This is provided in the ./doc
       subdirectory and probably in a separate package if you installed
       rsyslog via a packaging system.  To use rsyslog's advanced
       features, you <b>need </b>to look at the HTML documentation, because the
       man pages only covers basic aspects of operation.  <b>For details</b>
       <b>and configuration examples, see the rsyslog.conf (5) man page and</b>
       <b>the online documentation at <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pagestps://www.rsyslog.com/doc/&lt;/b&gt;">https://www.rsyslog.com/doc/</a></b>

       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/rsyslogd.8.html">Rsyslogd(8)</a> is derived from the sysklogd package which in turn is
       derived from the stock BSD sources.

       <b>Rsyslogd </b>provides a kind of logging that many modern programs
       use.  Every logged message contains at least a time and a
       hostname field, normally a program name field, too, but that
       depends on how trusty the logging program is. The rsyslog package
       supports free definition of output formats via templates. It also
       supports precise timestamps and writing directly to databases. If
       the database option is used, tools like phpLogCon can be used to
       view the log data.

       While the <b>rsyslogd </b>sources have been heavily modified a couple of
       notes are in order.  First of all there has been a systematic
       attempt to ensure that rsyslogd follows its default, standard BSD
       behavior. Of course, some configuration file changes are
       necessary in order to support the template system. However,
       rsyslogd should be able to use a standard syslog.conf and act
       like the original syslogd. However, an original syslogd will not
       work correctly with a rsyslog-enhanced configuration file. At
       best, it will generate funny looking file names.  The second
       important concept to note is that this version of rsyslogd
       interacts transparently with the version of syslog found in the
       standard libraries.  If a binary linked to the standard shared
       libraries fails to function correctly we would like an example of
       the anomalous behavior.

       The main configuration file <i>/etc/rsyslog.conf</i> or an alternative
       file, given with the <b>-f </b>option, is read at startup.  Any lines
       that begin with the hash mark (``#'') and empty lines are
       ignored.  If an error occurs during parsing the error element is
       ignored. It is tried to parse the rest of the line.
