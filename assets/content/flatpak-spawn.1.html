       Unlike other flatpak commands, <b>flatpak-spawn </b>is available to
       applications inside the sandbox. It runs COMMAND outside the
       sandbox, either in another sandbox, or on the host.

       <b>flatpak-spawn </b>uses the Flatpak portal to create a copy the
       sandbox it was called from, optionally using tighter permissions
       and the latest version of the app and runtime.
