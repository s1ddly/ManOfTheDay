       List commits that are reachable by following the <b>parent </b>links
       from the given commit(s), but exclude commits that are reachable
       from the one(s) given with a <i>^</i> in front of them. The output is
       given in reverse chronological order by default.

       You can think of this as a set operation. Commits reachable from
       any of the commits given on the command line form a set, and then
       commits reachable from any of the ones given with <i>^</i> in front are
       subtracted from that set. The remaining commits are what comes
       out in the commandâ€™s output. Various other options and paths
       parameters can be used to further limit the result.

       Thus, the following command:

           $ git rev-list foo bar ^baz

       means "list all the commits which are reachable from <i>foo</i> or <i>bar</i>,
       but not from <i>baz</i>".

       A special notation "<i>&lt;commit1&gt;</i>..<i>&lt;commit2&gt;</i>" can be used as a
       short-hand for "^<i>&lt;commit1&gt; &lt;commit2&gt;</i>". For example, either of the
       following may be used interchangeably:

           $ git rev-list origin..HEAD
           $ git rev-list HEAD ^origin

       Another special notation is "<i>&lt;commit1&gt;</i>...<i>&lt;commit2&gt;</i>" which is
       useful for merges. The resulting set of commits is the symmetric
       difference between the two operands. The following two commands
       are equivalent:

           $ git rev-list A B --not $(git merge-base --all A B)
           $ git rev-list A...B

       <i>rev-list</i> is a very essential Git command, since it provides the
       ability to build and traverse commit ancestry graphs. For this
       reason, it has a lot of different options that enables it to be
       used by commands as different as <i>git bisect</i> and <i>git repack</i>.
