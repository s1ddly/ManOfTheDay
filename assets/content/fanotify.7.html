<pre>
       The fanotify API provides notification and interception of
       filesystem events.  Use cases include virus scanning and
       hierarchical storage management.  In the original fanotify API,
       only a limited set of events was supported.  In particular, there
       was no support for create, delete, and move events.  The support
       for those events was added in Linux 5.1.  (See <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/inotify.7.html">inotify(7)</a> for
       details of an API that did notify those events pre Linux 5.1.)

       Additional capabilities compared to the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/inotify.7.html">inotify(7)</a> API include
       the ability to monitor all of the objects in a mounted
       filesystem, the ability to make access permission decisions, and
       the possibility to read or modify files before access by other
       applications.

       The following system calls are used with this API:
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fanotify_init.2.html">fanotify_init(2)</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fanotify_mark.2.html">fanotify_mark(2)</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/read.2.html">read(2)</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/write.2.html">write(2)</a>, and
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/close.2.html">close(2)</a>.

   <b>fanotify_init(), fanotify_mark(), and notification groups</b>
       The <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fanotify_init.2.html">fanotify_init(2)</a> system call creates and initializes an
       fanotify notification group and returns a file descriptor
       referring to it.

       An fanotify notification group is a kernel-internal object that
       holds a list of files, directories, filesystems, and mounts for
       which events shall be created.

       For each entry in an fanotify notification group, two bit masks
       exist: the <i>mark</i> mask and the <i>ignore</i> mask.  The mark mask defines
       file activities for which an event shall be created.  The ignore
       mask defines activities for which no event shall be generated.
       Having these two types of masks permits a filesystem, mount, or
       directory to be marked for receiving events, while at the same
       time ignoring events for specific objects under a mount or
       directory.

       The <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fanotify_mark.2.html">fanotify_mark(2)</a> system call adds a file, directory,
       filesystem, or mount to a notification group and specifies which
       events shall be reported (or ignored), or removes or modifies
       such an entry.

       A possible usage of the ignore mask is for a file cache.  Events
       of interest for a file cache are modification of a file and
       closing of the same.  Hence, the cached directory or mount is to
       be marked to receive these events.  After receiving the first
       event informing that a file has been modified, the corresponding
       cache entry will be invalidated.  No further modification events
       for this file are of interest until the file is closed.  Hence,
       the modify event can be added to the ignore mask.  Upon receiving
       the close event, the modify event can be removed from the ignore
       mask and the file cache entry can be updated.

       The entries in the fanotify notification groups refer to files
       and directories via their inode number and to mounts via their
       mount ID.  If files or directories are renamed or moved within
       the same mount, the respective entries survive.  If files or
       directories are deleted or moved to another mount or if
       filesystems or mounts are unmounted, the corresponding entries
       are deleted.

   <b>The event queue</b>
       As events occur on the filesystem objects monitored by a
       notification group, the fanotify system generates events that are
       collected in a queue.  These events can then be read (using
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/read.2.html">read(2)</a> or similar) from the fanotify file descriptor returned by
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fanotify_init.2.html">fanotify_init(2)</a>.

       Two types of events are generated: <i>notification</i> events and
       <i>permission</i> events.  Notification events are merely informative
       and require no action to be taken by the receiving application
       with one exception: if a valid file descriptor is provided within
       a generic event, the file descriptor must be closed.  Permission
       events are requests to the receiving application to decide
       whether permission for a file access shall be granted.  For these
       events, the recipient must write a response which decides whether
       access is granted or not.

       An event is removed from the event queue of the fanotify group
       when it has been read.  Permission events that have been read are
       kept in an internal list of the fanotify group until either a
       permission decision has been taken by writing to the fanotify
       file descriptor or the fanotify file descriptor is closed.

   <b>Reading fanotify events</b>
       Calling <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/read.2.html">read(2)</a> for the file descriptor returned by
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fanotify_init.2.html">fanotify_init(2)</a> blocks (if the flag <b>FAN_NONBLOCK </b>is not
       specified in the call to <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fanotify_init.2.html">fanotify_init(2)</a>) until either a file
       event occurs or the call is interrupted by a signal (see
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/signal.7.html">signal(7)</a>).

       The use of one of the flags <b>FAN_REPORT_FID</b>, <b>FAN_REPORT_DIR_FID </b>in
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fanotify_init.2.html">fanotify_init(2)</a> influences what data structures are returned to
       the event listener for each event.  Events reported to a group
       initialized with one of these flags will use file handles to
       identify filesystem objects instead of file descriptors.

       After a successful <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/read.2.html">read(2)</a>, the read buffer contains one or more
       of the following structures:

           struct fanotify_event_metadata {
               __u32 event_len;
               __u8 vers;
               __u8 reserved;
               __u16 metadata_len;
               __aligned_u64 mask;
               __s32 fd;
               __s32 pid;
           };

       In case of an fanotify group that identifies filesystem objects
       by file handles, you should also expect to receive one or more
       additional information records of the structure detailed below
       following the generic <i>fanotify_event_metadata</i> structure within
       the read buffer:

           struct fanotify_event_info_header {
               __u8 info_type;
               __u8 pad;
               __u16 len;
           };

           struct fanotify_event_info_fid {
               struct fanotify_event_info_header hdr;
               __kernel_fsid_t fsid;
               unsigned char file_handle[0];
           };

       For performance reasons, it is recommended to use a large buffer
       size (for example, 4096 bytes), so that multiple events can be
       retrieved by a single <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/read.2.html">read(2)</a>.

       The return value of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/read.2.html">read(2)</a> is the number of bytes placed in the
       buffer, or -1 in case of an error (but see BUGS).

       The fields of the <i>fanotify_event_metadata</i> structure are as
       follows:

       <i>event_len</i>
              This is the length of the data for the current event and
              the offset to the next event in the buffer.  Unless the
              group identifies filesystem objects by file handles, the
              value of <i>event_len</i> is always <b>FAN_EVENT_METADATA_LEN</b>.  For
              a group that identifies filesystem objects by file
              handles, <i>event_len</i> also includes the variable length file
              identifier records.

       <i>vers</i>   This field holds a version number for the structure.  It
              must be compared to <b>FANOTIFY_METADATA_VERSION </b>to verify
              that the structures returned at run time match the
              structures defined at compile time.  In case of a
              mismatch, the application should abandon trying to use the
              fanotify file descriptor.

       <i>reserved</i>
              This field is not used.

       <i>metadata_len</i>
              This is the length of the structure.  The field was
              introduced to facilitate the implementation of optional
              headers per event type.  No such optional headers exist in
              the current implementation.

       <i>mask</i>   This is a bit mask describing the event (see below).

       <i>fd</i>     This is an open file descriptor for the object being
              accessed, or <b>FAN_NOFD </b>if a queue overflow occurred.  With
              an fanotify group that identifies filesystem objects by
              file handles, applications should expect this value to be
              set to <b>FAN_NOFD </b>for each event that is received.  The file
              descriptor can be used to access the contents of the
              monitored file or directory.  The reading application is
              responsible for closing this file descriptor.

              When calling <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fanotify_init.2.html">fanotify_init(2)</a>, the caller may specify (via
              the <i>event_f_flags</i> argument) various file status flags that
              are to be set on the open file description that
              corresponds to this file descriptor.  In addition, the
              (kernel-internal) <b>FMODE_NONOTIFY </b>file status flag is set
              on the open file description.  This flag suppresses
              fanotify event generation.  Hence, when the receiver of
              the fanotify event accesses the notified file or directory
              using this file descriptor, no additional events will be
              created.

       <i>pid</i>    If flag <b>FAN_REPORT_TID </b>was set in <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fanotify_init.2.html">fanotify_init(2)</a>, this
              is the TID of the thread that caused the event.
              Otherwise, this the PID of the process that caused the
              event.

       A program listening to fanotify events can compare this PID to
       the PID returned by <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getpid.2.html">getpid(2)</a>, to determine whether the event is
       caused by the listener itself, or is due to a file access by
       another process.

       The bit mask in <i>mask</i> indicates which events have occurred for a
       single filesystem object.  Multiple bits may be set in this mask,
       if more than one event occurred for the monitored filesystem
       object.  In particular, consecutive events for the same
       filesystem object and originating from the same process may be
       merged into a single event, with the exception that two
       permission events are never merged into one queue entry.

       The bits that may appear in <i>mask</i> are as follows:

       <b>FAN_ACCESS</b>
              A file or a directory (but see BUGS) was accessed (read).

       <b>FAN_OPEN</b>
              A file or a directory was opened.

       <b>FAN_OPEN_EXEC</b>
              A file was opened with the intent to be executed.  See
              NOTES in <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fanotify_mark.2.html">fanotify_mark(2)</a> for additional details.

       <b>FAN_ATTRIB</b>
              A file or directory metadata was changed.

       <b>FAN_CREATE</b>
              A child file or directory was created in a watched parent.

       <b>FAN_DELETE</b>
              A child file or directory was deleted in a watched parent.

       <b>FAN_DELETE_SELF</b>
              A watched file or directory was deleted.

       <b>FAN_MOVED_FROM</b>
              A file or directory has been moved from a watched parent
              directory.

       <b>FAN_MOVED_TO</b>
              A file or directory has been moved to a watched parent
              directory.

       <b>FAN_MOVE_SELF</b>
              A watched file or directory was moved.

       <b>FAN_MODIFY</b>
              A file was modified.

       <b>FAN_CLOSE_WRITE</b>
              A file that was opened for writing (<b>O_WRONLY </b>or <b>O_RDWR</b>)
              was closed.

       <b>FAN_CLOSE_NOWRITE</b>
              A file or directory that was opened read-only (<b>O_RDONLY</b>)
              was closed.

       <b>FAN_Q_OVERFLOW</b>
              The event queue exceeded the limit of 16384 entries.  This
              limit can be overridden by specifying the
              <b>FAN_UNLIMITED_QUEUE </b>flag when calling <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fanotify_init.2.html">fanotify_init(2)</a>.

       <b>FAN_ACCESS_PERM</b>
              An application wants to read a file or directory, for
              example using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/read.2.html">read(2)</a> or <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/readdir.2.html">readdir(2)</a>.  The reader must
              write a response (as described below) that determines
              whether the permission to access the filesystem object
              shall be granted.

       <b>FAN_OPEN_PERM</b>
              An application wants to open a file or directory.  The
              reader must write a response that determines whether the
              permission to open the filesystem object shall be granted.

       <b>FAN_OPEN_EXEC_PERM</b>
              An application wants to open a file for execution.  The
              reader must write a response that determines whether the
              permission to open the filesystem object for execution
              shall be granted.  See NOTES in <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fanotify_mark.2.html">fanotify_mark(2)</a> for
              additional details.

       To check for any close event, the following bit mask may be used:

       <b>FAN_CLOSE</b>
              A file was closed.  This is a synonym for:

                  FAN_CLOSE_WRITE | FAN_CLOSE_NOWRITE

       To check for any move event, the following bit mask may be used:

       <b>FAN_MOVE</b>
              A file or directory was moved.  This is a synonym for:

                  FAN_MOVED_FROM | FAN_MOVED_TO

       The following bits may appear in <i>mask</i> only in conjunction with
       other event type bits:

       <b>FAN_ONDIR</b>
              The events described in the <i>mask</i> have occurred on a
              directory object.  Reporting events on directories
              requires setting this flag in the mark mask.  See
              <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fanotify_mark.2.html">fanotify_mark(2)</a> for additional details.  The <b>FAN_ONDIR</b>
              flag is reported in an event mask only if the fanotify
              group identifies filesystem objects by file handles.

       The fields of the <i>fanotify_event_info_fid</i> structure are as
       follows:

       <i>hdr</i>    This is a structure of type <i>fanotify_event_info_header</i>.
              It is a generic header that contains information used to
              describe an additional information record attached to the
              event.  For example, when an fanotify file descriptor is
              created using <b>FAN_REPORT_FID</b>, a single information record
              is expected to be attached to the event with <i>info_type</i>
              field value of <b>FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_FID</b>.  When an fanotify
              file descriptor is created using the combination of
              <b>FAN_REPORT_FID </b>and <b>FAN_REPORT_DIR_FID</b>, there may be two
              information records attached to the event: one with
              <i>info_type</i> field value of <b>FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_DFID</b>,
              identifying a parent directory object, and one with
              <i>info_type</i> field value of <b>FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_FID</b>,
              identifying a non-directory object.  The
              <i>fanotify_event_info_header</i> contains a <i>len</i> field.  The
              value of <i>len</i> is the size of the additional information
              record including the <i>fanotify_event_info_header</i> itself.
              The total size of all additional information records is
              not expected to be bigger than ( <i>event_len</i> - <i>metadata_len</i>
              ).

       <i>fsid</i>   This is a unique identifier of the filesystem containing
              the object associated with the event.  It is a structure
              of type <i>__kernel_fsid_t</i> and contains the same value as
              <i>f_fsid</i> when calling <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/statfs.2.html">statfs(2)</a>.

       <i>file_handle</i>
              This is a variable length structure of type struct
              file_handle.  It is an opaque handle that corresponds to a
              specified object on a filesystem as returned by
              <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/name_to_handle_at.2.html">name_to_handle_at(2)</a>.  It can be used to uniquely identify
              a file on a filesystem and can be passed as an argument to
              <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/open_by_handle_at.2.html">open_by_handle_at(2)</a>.  Note that for the directory entry
              modification events <b>FAN_CREATE</b>, <b>FAN_DELETE</b>, and <b>FAN_MOVE</b>,
              the <i>file_handle</i> identifies the modified directory and not
              the created/deleted/moved child object.  If the value of
              <i>info_type</i> field is <b>FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_DFID_NAME</b>, the file
              handle is followed by a null terminated string that
              identifies the created/deleted/moved directory entry name.
              For other events such as <b>FAN_OPEN</b>, <b>FAN_ATTRIB</b>,
              <b>FAN_DELETE_SELF</b>, and <b>FAN_MOVE_SELF</b>, if the value of
              <i>info_type</i> field is <b>FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_FID</b>, the
              <i>file_handle</i> identifies the object correlated to the event.
              If the value of <i>info_type</i> field is
              <b>FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_DFID</b>, the <i>file_handle</i> identifies the
              directory object correlated to the event or the parent
              directory of a non-directory object correlated to the
              event.  If the value of <i>info_type</i> field is
              <b>FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_DFID_NAME</b>, the <i>file_handle</i> identifies
              the same directory object that would be reported with
              <b>FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_DFID </b>and the file handle is followed
              by a null terminated string that identifies the name of a
              directory entry in that directory, or '.' to identify the
              directory object itself.

       The following macros are provided to iterate over a buffer
       containing fanotify event metadata returned by a <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/read.2.html">read(2)</a> from an
       fanotify file descriptor:

       <b>FAN_EVENT_OK(meta, len)</b>
              This macro checks the remaining length <i>len</i> of the buffer
              <i>meta</i> against the length of the metadata structure and the
              <i>event_len</i> field of the first metadata structure in the
              buffer.

       <b>FAN_EVENT_NEXT(meta, len)</b>
              This macro uses the length indicated in the <i>event_len</i>
              field of the metadata structure pointed to by <i>meta</i> to
              calculate the address of the next metadata structure that
              follows <i>meta</i>.  <i>len</i> is the number of bytes of metadata that
              currently remain in the buffer.  The macro returns a
              pointer to the next metadata structure that follows <i>meta</i>,
              and reduces <i>len</i> by the number of bytes in the metadata
              structure that has been skipped over (i.e., it subtracts
              <i>meta-&gt;event_len</i> from <i>len</i>).

       In addition, there is:

       <b>FAN_EVENT_METADATA_LEN</b>
              This macro returns the size (in bytes) of the structure
              <i>fanotify_event_metadata</i>.  This is the minimum size (and
              currently the only size) of any event metadata.

   <b>Monitoring an fanotify file descriptor for events</b>
       When an fanotify event occurs, the fanotify file descriptor
       indicates as readable when passed to <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/epoll.7.html">epoll(7)</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/poll.2.html">poll(2)</a>, or
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/select.2.html">select(2)</a>.

   <b>Dealing with permission events</b>
       For permission events, the application must <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/write.2.html">write(2)</a> a structure
       of the following form to the fanotify file descriptor:

           struct fanotify_response {
               __s32 fd;
               __u32 response;
           };

       The fields of this structure are as follows:

       <i>fd</i>     This is the file descriptor from the structure
              <i>fanotify_event_metadata</i>.

       <i>response</i>
              This field indicates whether or not the permission is to
              be granted.  Its value must be either <b>FAN_ALLOW </b>to allow
              the file operation or <b>FAN_DENY </b>to deny the file operation.

       If access is denied, the requesting application call will receive
       an <b>EPERM </b>error.  Additionally, if the notification group has been
       created with the <b>FAN_ENABLE_AUDIT </b>flag, then the <b>FAN_AUDIT </b>flag
       can be set in the <i>response</i> field.  In that case, the audit
       subsystem will log information about the access decision to the
       audit logs.

   <b>Closing the fanotify file descriptor</b>
       When all file descriptors referring to the fanotify notification
       group are closed, the fanotify group is released and its
       resources are freed for reuse by the kernel.  Upon <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/close.2.html">close(2)</a>,
       outstanding permission events will be set to allowed.

   <b>/proc/[pid]/fdinfo</b>
       The file <i>/proc/[pid]/fdinfo/[fd]</i> contains information about
       fanotify marks for file descriptor <i>fd</i> of process <i>pid</i>.  See
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/proc.5.html">proc(5)</a> for details.
