       <b>dh_installdirs </b>is a debhelper program that is responsible for
       creating subdirectories in package build directories.

       Many packages can get away with omitting the call to
       <b>dh_installdirs </b>completely.  Notably, other <b>dh_* </b>commands are
       expected to create directories as needed.
