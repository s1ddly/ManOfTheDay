       <b>systemd-machined </b>is a system service that keeps track of locally
       running virtual machines and containers.

       <b>systemd-machined </b>is useful for registering and keeping track of
       both OS containers (containers that share the host kernel but run
       a full init system of their own and behave in most regards like a
       full virtual operating system rather than just one virtualized
       app) and full virtual machines (virtualized hardware running
       normal operating systems and possibly different kernels).

       <b>systemd-machined </b>should <i>not</i> be used for registering/keeping track
       of application sandbox containers. A <i>machine</i> in the context of
       <b>systemd-machined </b>is supposed to be an abstract term covering both
       OS containers and full virtual machines, but not application
       sandboxes.

       Machines registered with machined are exposed in various ways in
       the system. For example:

       •   Tools like <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ps.1.html">ps(1)</a> will show to which machine a specific
           process belongs in a column of its own, and so will
           <b>gnome-system-monitor</b><b></b>[1] or <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/systemd-cgls.1.html">systemd-cgls(1)</a>.

       •   systemd's various tools (<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/systemctl.1.html">systemctl(1)</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/journalctl.1.html">journalctl(1)</a>,
           <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/loginctl.1.html">loginctl(1)</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/hostnamectl.1.html">hostnamectl(1)</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/timedatectl.1.html">timedatectl(1)</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/localectl.1.html">localectl(1)</a>,
           <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/machinectl.1.html">machinectl(1)</a>, ...) support the <b>-M </b>switch to operate on local
           containers instead of the host system.

       •   <b>systemctl list-machines </b>will show the system state of all
           local containers, connecting to the container's init system
           for that.

       •   systemctl's <b>--recursive </b>switch has the effect of not only
           showing the locally running services, but recursively showing
           the services of all registered containers.

       •   The <b>machinectl </b>command provides access to a number of useful
           operations on registered containers, such as introspecting
           them, rebooting, shutting them down, and getting a login
           prompt on them.

       •   The <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/sd-bus.3.html">sd-bus(3)</a> library exposes the
           <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/sd_bus_open_system_machine.3.html">sd_bus_open_system_machine(3)</a> call to connect to the system
           bus of any registered container.

       •   The <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/nss-mymachines.8.html">nss-mymachines(8)</a> module makes sure all registered
           containers can be resolved via normal glibc <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/gethostbyname.3.html">gethostbyname(3)</a>
           or <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/getaddrinfo.3.html">getaddrinfo(3)</a> calls.

       See <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/systemd-nspawn.1.html">systemd-nspawn(1)</a> for some examples on how to run containers
       with OS tools.

       If you are interested in writing a VM or container manager that
       makes use of machined, please have look at <b>Writing Virtual</b>
       <b>Machine or Container Managers</b><b></b>[2]. Also see the <b>New Control Group</b>
       <b>Interfaces</b><b></b>[3].

       The daemon provides both a C library interface (which is shared
       with <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/systemd-logind.service.8.html">systemd-logind.service(8)</a>) as well as a D-Bus interface. The
       library interface may be used to introspect and watch the state
       of virtual machines/containers. The bus interface provides the
       same but in addition may also be used to register or terminate
       machines. For more information please consult <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/sd-login.3.html">sd-login(3)</a> and
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/org.freedesktop.machine1.5.html">org.freedesktop.machine1(5)</a> and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/org.freedesktop.LogControl1.5.html">org.freedesktop.LogControl1(5)</a>.

       A small companion daemon <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/systemd-importd.service.8.html">systemd-importd.service(8)</a> is also
       available, which implements importing, exporting, and downloading
       of container and VM images.

       For each container registered with systemd-machined.service that
       employs user namespacing, users/groups are synthesized for the
       used UIDs/GIDs. These are made available to the system using the
       <b>User/Group Record Lookup API via Varlink</b><b></b>[4], and thus may be
       resolved with <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/userdbctl.1.html">userdbctl(1)</a> or the usual glibc NSS calls.
