       systemd-suspend.service is a system service that is pulled in by
       suspend.target and is responsible for the actual system suspend.
       Similarly, systemd-hibernate.service is pulled in by
       hibernate.target to execute the actual hibernation. Finally,
       systemd-hybrid-sleep.service is pulled in by hybrid-sleep.target
       to execute hybrid hibernation with system suspend and pulled in
       by suspend-then-hibernate.target to execute system suspend with a
       timeout that will activate hibernate later.

       Immediately before entering system suspend and/or hibernation
       systemd-suspend.service (and the other mentioned units,
       respectively) will run all executables in
       /usr/lib/systemd/system-sleep/ and pass two arguments to them.
       The first argument will be "pre", the second either "suspend",
       "hibernate", "hybrid-sleep", or "suspend-then-hibernate"
       depending on the chosen action. An environment variable called
       "SYSTEMD_SLEEP_ACTION" will be set and contain the sleep action
       that is processing. This is primarily helpful for
       "suspend-then-hibernate" where the value of the variable will be
       "suspend", "hibernate", or "suspend-after-failed-hibernate" in
       cases where hibernation has failed. Immediately after leaving
       system suspend and/or hibernation the same executables are run,
       but the first argument is now "post". All executables in this
       directory are executed in parallel, and execution of the action
       is not continued until all executables have finished.

       Note that scripts or binaries dropped in
       /usr/lib/systemd/system-sleep/ are intended for local use only
       and should be considered hacks. If applications want to react to
       system suspend/hibernation and resume, they should rather use the
       <b>Inhibitor interface</b><b></b>[1].

       Note that systemd-suspend.service, systemd-hibernate.service,
       systemd-hybrid-sleep.service, and
       systemd-suspend-then-hibernate.service should never be executed
       directly. Instead, trigger system sleep with a command such as
       <b>systemctl suspend </b>or <b>systemctl hibernate</b>.

       Internally, this service will echo a string like "mem" into
       /sys/power/state, to trigger the actual system suspend. What
       exactly is written where can be configured in the [Sleep] section
       of /etc/systemd/sleep.conf or a sleep.conf.d file. See
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/systemd-sleep.conf.5.html">systemd-sleep.conf(5)</a>.
