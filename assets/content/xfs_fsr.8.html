       <i>xfs_fsr</i> is applicable only to XFS filesystems.

       <i>xfs_fsr</i> improves the organization of mounted filesystems.  The
       reorganization algorithm operates on one file at a time,
       compacting or otherwise improving the layout of the file extents
       (contiguous blocks of file data).

       The following options are accepted by <i>xfs_fsr</i>.  The <b>-m</b>, <b>-t</b>, and
       <b>-f </b>options have no meaning if any filesystems or files are
       specified on the command line.

       <b>-m </b><i>mtab</i>
              Use this file for the list of filesystems to reorganize.
              The default is to use <i>/etc/mtab</i>.

       <b>-t </b><i>seconds</i>
              How long to reorganize.  The default is 7200 seconds (2
              hours).

       <b>-p </b><i>passes</i>
              Number of passes before terminating global re-org.  The
              default is 10 passes.

       <b>-f </b><i>leftoff</i>
              Use this file instead of <i>/var/tmp/.fsrlast</i> to read the
              state of where to start and as the file to store the state
              of where reorganization left off.

       <b>-v     </b>Verbose.  Print cryptic information about each file being
              reorganized.

       <b>-d     </b>Debug.  Print even more cryptic information.

       <b>-g     </b>Print to syslog (default if stdout not a tty).

       <b>-V     </b>Prints the version number and exits.

       When invoked with no arguments <i>xfs_fsr</i> reorganizes all regular
       files in all mounted filesystems.  <i>xfs_fsr</i> makes many cycles over
       <i>/etc/mtab</i> each time making a single pass over each XFS
       filesystem.  Each pass goes through and selects files that have
       the largest number of extents.  It attempts to defragment the top
       10% of these files on each pass.

       It runs for up to two hours after which it records the filesystem
       where it left off, so it can start there the next time.  This
       information is stored in the file <i>/var/tmp/.fsrlast_xfs.</i>  If the
       information found here is somehow inconsistent or out of date it
       is ignored and reorganization starts at the beginning of the
       first filesystem found in <i>/etc/mtab</i>.

       <i>xfs_fsr</i> can be called with one or more arguments naming
       filesystems (block device name), and files to reorganize.  In
       this mode <i>xfs_fsr</i> does not read or write <i>/var/tmp/.fsrlast_xfs</i>
       nor does it run for a fixed time interval.  It makes one pass
       through each specified regular file and all regular files in each
       specified filesystem.  A command line name referring to a
       symbolic link (except to a file system device), FIFO, or UNIX
       domain socket generates a warning message, but is otherwise
       ignored.  While traversing the filesystem these types of files
       are silently skipped.
