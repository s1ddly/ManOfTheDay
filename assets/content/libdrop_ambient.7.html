<pre>
       This library can be used via LD_PRELOAD to force an application
       started with ambient capabilities to drop them. It leaves other
       capabilities intact. This can also be linked against and
       automatically does the right thing. You do not need to make any
       calls into the library because all the work is done in the
       constructor which runs before main() is called.
