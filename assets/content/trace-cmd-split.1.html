       The trace-cmd(1) split is used to break up a trace.dat into small
       files. The <i>start-time</i> specifies where the new file will start at.
       Using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/trace-cmd-report.1.html">trace-cmd-report(1)</a> and copying the time stamp given at a
       particular event, can be used as input for either <i>start-time</i> or
       <i>end-time</i>. The split will stop creating files when it reaches an
       event after <i>end-time</i>. If only the end-time is needed, use 0.0 as
       the start-time.

       If start-time is left out, then the split will start at the
       beginning of the file. If end-time is left out, then split will
       continue to the end unless it meets one of the requirements
       specified by the options.
