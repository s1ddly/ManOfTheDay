       This command allows to run simple daemon process that starts and
       monitors configured record sessions.

       You can imagine <i>perf daemon</i> of background process with several
       <i>perf record</i> child tasks, like:

           # ps axjf
           ...
                1  916507 ... perf daemon start
           916507  916508 ...  \_ perf record --control=fifo:control,ack -m 10M -e cycles --overwrite --switch-output -a
           916507  916509 ...  \_ perf record --control=fifo:control,ack -m 20M -e sched:* --overwrite --switch-output -a

       Not every <i>perf record</i> session is suitable for running under
       daemon. User need perf session that either produces data on
       query, like the flight recorder sessions in above example or
       session that is configured to produce data periodically, like
       with --switch-output configuration for time and size.

       Each session is started with control setup (with perf record
       --control options).

       Sessions are configured through config file, see CONFIG FILE
       section with EXAMPLES.
