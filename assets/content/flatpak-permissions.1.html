       Lists dynamic permissions which are stored in the Flatpak
       permission store.

       When called without arguments, lists all the entries in all
       permission store tables. When called with one argument, lists all
       the entries in the named table. When called with two arguments,
       lists the entry in the named table for the given object ID.

       The permission store is used by portals. Each portal generally
       has its own table in the permission store, and the format of the
       table entries is specific to each portal.
