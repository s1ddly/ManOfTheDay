<pre>
       A TIPC socket is represented by an unsigned integer.

          <b>Bound state</b>
              A bound socket has a logical TIPC port name associated
              with it.

          <b>Connected state</b>
              A connected socket is directly connected to another socket
              creating a point to point connection between TIPC sockets.
              If the connection to X was made using a logical port name
              Y that name will show up as <b>connected to </b>X <b>via </b>Y
