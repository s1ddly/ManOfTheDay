       Flatpak maintains a list of patterns that define which refs are
       pinned. A pinned ref will never be automatically uninstalled (as
       are unused runtimes periodically). This can be useful if for
       example you are using a runtime for development purposes.

       Runtimes that are explicitly installed, rather than installed as
       a dependency of something else, are automatically pinned.

       The patterns are just a partial ref, with the * character
       matching anything within that part of the ref. Only runtimes can
       be pinned, not apps. Here are some example patterns:

           org.some.Runtime
           org.some.Runtime//unstable
           runtime/org.domain.*
           org.some.Runtime/arm

       To list the current set of pins, run this command without any
       patterns.
