       <b>Route </b>manipulates the kernel's IP routing tables.  Its primary
       use is to set up static routes to specific hosts or networks via
       an interface after it has been configured with the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ifconfig.8.html">ifconfig(8)</a>
       program.

       When the <b>add </b>or <b>del </b>options are used, <b>route </b>modifies the routing
       tables.  Without these options, <b>route </b>displays the current
       contents of the routing tables.
