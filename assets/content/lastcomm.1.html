       <b>lastcomm </b>prints out information about previously executed
       commands.  If no arguments are specified, <b>lastcomm </b>will print
       info about all of the commands in <i>acct</i> (the record file).  If
       called with one or more of <i>command-name, user-name,</i> or <i>terminal-</i>
       <i>name,</i> only records containing those items will be displayed.  For
       example, to find out which users used command `a.out' and which
       users were logged into `tty0', type:
                              lastcomm a.out tty0

       This will print any entry for which `a.out' or `tty0' matches in
       any of the record's fields (command, name, or terminal).  If you
       want to find only items that match *all* of the arguments on the
       command line, you must use the '-strict-match' option.  For
       example, to list all of the executions of command <i>a.out</i> by user
       <i>root</i> on terminal <i>tty0,</i> type:
        lastcomm --strict-match --command a.out --user root --tty tty0

       The order of the arguments is not important.

       For each entry the following information is printed:
          + command name of the process
          + flags, as recorded by the system accounting routines:
               S -- command executed by super-user
               F -- command executed after a fork but without a
       following exec
               C -- command run in PDP-11 compatibility mode (VAX only)
               D -- command terminated with the generation of a core
       file
               X -- command was terminated with the signal SIGTERM
          + the name of the user who ran the process
          + time the process started
