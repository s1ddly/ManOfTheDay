<pre>
       This command resolves both system call names and numbers with
       respect to the given architecture supplied in the optional <i>ARCH</i>
       argument.  If the architecture is not supplied on the command
       line then the native architecture is used.  If the "-t" argument
       is specified along with a system call name, then the system call
       will be translated as necessary for the given architecture.  The
       "-t" argument has no effect if a system call number is specified.

       In some combinations of architecture and system call, a negative
       system call number will be displayed.  A negative system call
       number indicates that the system call is not defined for the
       given architecture and is treated in a special manner by
       libseccomp depending on the operation.

       <b>-a </b><i>ARCH</i>
              The architecture to use for resolving the system call.
              Valid <i>ARCH</i> values are "x86", "x86_64", "x32", "arm",
              "aarch64", "mips", "mipsel", "mips64", "mipsel64",
              "mips64n32", "mipsel64n32", "parisc", "parisc64", "ppc",
              "ppc64", "ppc64le", "s390", "s390x", "sheb" and "sh".

       <b>-t     </b>If necessary, translate the system call name to the proper
              system call number, even if the system call name is
              different, e.g. socket(2) on x86.

       <b>-h     </b>A simple one-line usage display.
