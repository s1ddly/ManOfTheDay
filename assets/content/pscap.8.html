       <b>pscap </b>is a program that prints out a report of process
       capabilities. If the application has any capabilities, it will be
       in the report with the exception of init. By giving the -a
       command line option, init will be included, too. If a process is
       not in the report, it has dropped all capabilities. If the
       process has partial capabilities, it is further examined to see
       if it has an open-ended bounding set. If this is found to be
       true, a '+' symbol is added. If the process has ambient
       capabilities, a '@' symbols is added.

       The command name in the output may be followed by an asterisk
       mark (*). This mark denotes processes which run in child user
       namespaces (relative to the user namespace of pscap itself).
