       The <i>cxref</i> utility shall analyze a collection of C-language <i>file</i>s
       and attempt to build a cross-reference table. Information from
       <b>#define </b>lines shall be included in the symbol table. A sorted
       listing shall be written to standard output of all symbols (auto,
       static, and global) in each <i>file</i> separately, or with the <b>-c</b>
       option, in combination. Each symbol shall contain an &lt;asterisk&gt;
       before the declaring reference.
