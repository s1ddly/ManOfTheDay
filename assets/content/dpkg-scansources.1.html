       <b>dpkg-scansources </b>scans the given <i>binary-dir</i> for <i>.dsc</i> files.
       These are used to create a Debian source index, which is output
       to stdout.

       The <i>override-file</i>, if given, is used to set priorities in the
       resulting index records and to override the maintainer field
       given in the <i>.dsc</i> files.  The file can be compressed (since dpkg
       1.15.5).  See <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/deb-override.5.html">deb-override(5)</a> for the format of this file. Note:
       Since the override file is indexed by binary, not source
       packages, there's a bit of a problem here. The current
       implementation uses the highest priority of all the binary
       packages produced by a <i>.dsc</i> file for the priority of the source
       package, and the override entry for the first binary package
       listed in the <i>.dsc</i> file to modify maintainer information. This
       might change.

       The <i>path-prefix</i>, if given, is prepended to the directory field in
       the generated source index. You generally use this to make the
       directory fields contain the path from the top of the Debian
       archive hierarchy.

       <b>Note: </b>If you want to access the generated Sources file with
       <b>apt</b>(8) you will probably need to compress the file with <b>gzip</b>(1)
       (generating a Sources.gz file). apt ignores uncompressed Sources
       files except on local access (i.e.  <b>file:// </b>sources).
