       <b>autrace </b>is a program that will add the audit rules to trace a
       process similar to strace. It will then execute the <i>program</i>
       passing <i>arguments</i> to it. The resulting audit information will be
       in the audit logs if the audit daemon is running or syslog. This
       command deletes all audit rules prior to executing the target
       program and after executing it. As a safety precaution, it will
       not run unless all rules are deleted with <b>auditctl </b>prior to use.
