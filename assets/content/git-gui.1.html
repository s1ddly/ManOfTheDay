<pre>
       A Tcl/Tk based graphical user interface to Git. <i>git gui</i> focuses
       on allowing users to make changes to their repository by making
       new commits, amending existing ones, creating branches,
       performing local merges, and fetching/pushing to remote
       repositories.

       Unlike <i>gitk</i>, <i>git gui</i> focuses on commit generation and single file
       annotation and does not show project history. It does however
       supply menu actions to start a <i>gitk</i> session from within <i>git gui</i>.

       <i>git gui</i> is known to work on all popular UNIX systems, Mac OS X,
       and Windows (under both Cygwin and MSYS). To the extent possible
       OS specific user interface guidelines are followed, making <i>git</i>
       <i>gui</i> a fairly native interface for users.
