       This series of shell scripts and associated control files may be
       used to create a customized regime of administration and
       management for the Performance Co-Pilot (see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/PCPIntro.1.html">PCPIntro(1)</a>)
       inference engine, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmie.1.html">pmie(1)</a>.

       <b>pmie_check </b>may be run at any time of the day and verifies that a
       desired set of <b>pmie </b>processes is running.  If not, it (re-)starts
       any missing inference engine processes.

       <b>pmie_daily </b>is intended to be run once per day, preferably in the
       early morning, as soon after midnight as practicable.  Its task
       is to rotate the log files for the running <b>pmie </b>processes - these
       files may grow without bound if the ``print'' action is used, or
       any other <b>pmie </b>action writes to its stdout/stderr streams.  After
       some period, old <b>pmie </b>log files are discarded.
