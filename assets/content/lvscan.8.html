       lvscan scans all VGs or all supported LVM block devices in the
       system for LVs. The output consists of one line for each LV
       indicating whether or not it is active, a snapshot or origin, the
       size of the device and its allocation policy. Use <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/lvs.8.html">lvs(8)</a> or
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/lvdisplay.8.html">lvdisplay(8)</a> to obtain more comprehensive information about LVs.
