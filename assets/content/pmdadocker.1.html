       <b>pmdadocker </b>is a docker Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA)
       which exposes performance metrics as reported from the Docker
       Remote API.

       A brief description of the <b>pmdadocker </b>command line options
       follows:

       <b>-d   </b>It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics <i>domain</i>
            number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is,
            <i>domain</i> should be different for every PMDA on the one host,
            and the same <i>domain</i> number should be used for the same PMDA
            on all hosts.

       <b>-l   </b>Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
            <i>docker.log</i> is written in the current directory of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a>
            when <b>pmdadocker </b>is started, i.e.  <b>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd</b>.  If the
            log file cannot be created or is not writable, output is
            written to the standard error instead.

       Remote API metric requests are activated automatically and are
       fetched on a timer.  This timer is represented as a by <b>pmdadocker</b>
       via the <b>docker.control.timing.  </b>By default, <b>pmdadocker </b>will be
       set to fetch on a 1 second interval.

       <b>pmdadocker </b>will iterate over three different <b>docker </b>remote API
       calls:

       <b>/containers/$ID/json</b>
              Container metrics regarding the current state of the
              container. Such as PID, name or if the container is
              running.

       <b>/version</b>
              Basic version metrics about the current docker deamon in
              use.

       <b>/containers/$ID/stats?stream=0</b>
              More in depth memory and cpu metrics of the container.
