<pre>
       The <b>@TPUT@ </b>utility uses the <b>terminfo </b>database to make the values
       of terminal-dependent capabilities and information available to
       the shell (see <b>sh</b>(1)), to initialize or reset the terminal, or
       return the long name of the requested terminal type.  The result
       depends upon the capability's type:

          string
               <b>@TPUT@ </b>writes the string to the standard output.  No
               trailing newline is supplied.

          integer
               <b>@TPUT@ </b>writes the decimal value to the standard output,
               with a trailing newline.

          boolean
               <b>@TPUT@ </b>simply sets the exit code (<b>0 </b>for TRUE if the
               terminal has the capability, <b>1 </b>for FALSE if it does not),
               and writes nothing to the standard output.

       Before using a value returned on the standard output, the
       application should test the exit code (e.g., <b>$?</b>, see <b>sh</b>(1)) to be
       sure it is <b>0</b>.  (See the <b>EXIT CODES </b>and <b>DIAGNOSTICS </b>sections.)
       For a complete list of capabilities and the <i>capname</i> associated
       with each, see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/terminfo.5.html">terminfo(5)</a>.

   <b>Options</b>
       <b>-S     </b>allows more than one capability per invocation of <b>@TPUT@</b>.
              The capabilities must be passed to <b>@TPUT@ </b>from the
              standard input instead of from the command line (see
              example).  Only one <i>capname</i> is allowed per line.  The <b>-S</b>
              option changes the meaning of the <b>0 </b>and <b>1 </b>boolean and
              string exit codes (see the EXIT CODES section).

              Because some capabilities may use <i>string</i> parameters rather
              than <i>numbers</i>, <b>@TPUT@ </b>uses a table and the presence of
              parameters in its input to decide whether to use
              <b>tparm</b>(3X), and how to interpret the parameters.

       <b>-T</b><i>type</i> indicates the <i>type</i> of terminal.  Normally this option is
              unnecessary, because the default is taken from the
              environment variable <b>TERM</b>.  If <b>-T </b>is specified, then the
              shell variables <b>LINES </b>and <b>COLUMNS </b>will also be ignored.

       <b>-V     </b>reports the version of ncurses which was used in this
              program, and exits.

       <b>-x     </b>do not attempt to clear the terminal's scrollback buffer
              using the extended “E3” capability.

   <b>Commands</b>
       A few commands (<b>init</b>, <b>reset </b>and <b>longname</b>) are special; they are
       defined by the <b>@TPUT@ </b>program.  The others are the names of
       <i>capabilities</i> from the terminal database (see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/terminfo.5.html">terminfo(5)</a> for a
       list).  Although <b>init </b>and <b>reset </b>resemble capability names, <b>@TPUT@</b>
       uses several capabilities to perform these special functions.

       <i>capname</i>
              indicates the capability from the terminal database.

              If the capability is a string that takes parameters, the
              arguments following the capability will be used as
              parameters for the string.

              Most parameters are numbers.  Only a few terminal
              capabilities require string parameters; <b>@TPUT@ </b>uses a
              table to decide which to pass as strings.  Normally <b>@TPUT@</b>
              uses <b>tparm</b>(3X) to perform the substitution.  If no
              parameters are given for the capability, <b>@TPUT@ </b>writes the
              string without performing the substitution.

       <b>init   </b>If the terminal database is present and an entry for the
              user's terminal exists (see <b>-T</b><i>type</i>, above), the following
              will occur:

              (1)  first, <b>@TPUT@ </b>retrieves the current terminal mode
                   settings for your terminal.  It does this by
                   successively testing

                   •   the standard error,

                   •   standard output,

                   •   standard input and

                   •   ultimately “/dev/tty”

                   to obtain terminal settings.  Having retrieved these
                   settings, <b>@TPUT@ </b>remembers which file descriptor to
                   use when updating settings.

              (2)  if the window size cannot be obtained from the
                   operating system, but the terminal description (or
                   environment, e.g., <b>LINES </b>and <b>COLUMNS </b>variables
                   specify this), update the operating system's notion
                   of the window size.

              (3)  the terminal modes will be updated:

                   •   any delays (e.g., newline) specified in the entry
                       will be set in the tty driver,

                   •   tabs expansion will be turned on or off according
                       to the specification in the entry, and

                   •   if tabs are not expanded, standard tabs will be
                       set (every 8 spaces).

              (4)  if present, the terminal's initialization strings
                   will be output as detailed in the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/terminfo.5.html">terminfo(5)</a> section
                   on <i>Tabs and Initialization</i>,

              (5)  output is flushed.

              If an entry does not contain the information needed for
              any of these activities, that activity will silently be
              skipped.

       <b>reset  </b>This is similar to <b>init</b>, with two differences:

              (1)  before any other initialization, the terminal modes
                   will be reset to a “sane” state:

                   •   set cooked and echo modes,

                   •   turn off cbreak and raw modes,

                   •   turn on newline translation and

                   •   reset any unset special characters to their
                       default values

              (2)  Instead of putting out <i>initialization</i> strings, the
                   terminal's <i>reset</i> strings will be output if present
                   (<b>rs1</b>, <b>rs2</b>, <b>rs3</b>, <b>rf</b>).  If the <i>reset</i> strings are not
                   present, but <i>initialization</i> strings are, the
                   <i>initialization</i> strings will be output.

              Otherwise, <b>reset </b>acts identically to <b>init</b>.

       <b>longname</b>
              If the terminal database is present and an entry for the
              user's terminal exists (see <b>-T</b><i>type</i> above), then the long
              name of the terminal will be put out.  The long name is
              the last name in the first line of the terminal's
              description in the <b>terminfo </b>database [see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/term.5.html">term(5)</a>].

   <b>Aliases</b>
       <b>@TPUT@ </b>handles the <b>clear</b>, <b>init </b>and <b>reset </b>commands specially: it
       allows for the possibility that it is invoked by a link with
       those names.

       If <b>@TPUT@ </b>is invoked by a link named <b>reset</b>, this has the same
       effect as <b>@TPUT@ reset</b>.  The <b>@TSET@</b>(1) utility also treats a link
       named <b>reset </b>specially.

       Before ncurses 6.1, the two utilities were different from each
       other:

       •   <b>@TSET@ </b>utility reset the terminal modes and special
           characters (not done with <b>@TPUT@</b>).

       •   On the other hand, <b>@TSET@</b>'s repertoire of terminal
           capabilities for resetting the terminal was more limited,
           i.e., only <b>reset_1string</b>, <b>reset_2string </b>and <b>reset_file </b>in
           contrast to the tab-stops and margins which are set by this
           utility.

       •   The <b>reset </b>program is usually an alias for <b>@TSET@</b>, because of
           this difference with resetting terminal modes and special
           characters.

       With the changes made for ncurses 6.1, the <i>reset</i> feature of the
       two programs is (mostly) the same.  A few differences remain:

       •   The <b>@TSET@ </b>program waits one second when resetting, in case
           it happens to be a hardware terminal.

       •   The two programs write the terminal initialization strings to
           different streams (i.e., the standard error for <b>@TSET@ </b>and
           the standard output for <b>@TPUT@</b>).

           <b>Note: </b>although these programs write to different streams,
           redirecting their output to a file will capture only part of
           their actions.  The changes to the terminal modes are not
           affected by redirecting the output.

       If <b>@TPUT@ </b>is invoked by a link named <b>init</b>, this has the same
       effect as <b>@TPUT@ init</b>.  Again, you are less likely to use that
       link because another program named <b>init </b>has a more well-
       established use.

   <b>Terminal Size</b>
       Besides the special commands (e.g., <b>clear</b>), @TPUT@ treats certain
       terminfo capabilities specially: <b>lines </b>and <b>cols</b>.  @TPUT@ calls
       <b>setupterm</b>(3X) to obtain the terminal size:

       •   first, it gets the size from the terminal database (which
           generally is not provided for terminal emulators which do not
           have a fixed window size)

       •   then it asks the operating system for the terminal's size
           (which generally works, unless connecting via a serial line
           which does not support <i>NAWS</i>: negotiations about window size).

       •   finally, it inspects the environment variables <b>LINES </b>and
           <b>COLUMNS </b>which may override the terminal size.

       If the <b>-T </b>option is given @TPUT@ ignores the environment
       variables by calling <b>use_tioctl(TRUE)</b>, relying upon the operating
       system (or finally, the terminal database).
