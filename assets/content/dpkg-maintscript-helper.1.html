<pre>
       This program is designed to be run within maintainer scripts to
       achieve some tasks that <b>dpkg </b>can't (yet) handle natively either
       because of design decisions or due to current limitations.

       Many of those tasks require coordinated actions from several
       maintainer scripts (<b>preinst</b>, <b>postinst</b>, <b>prerm</b>, <b>postrm</b>). To avoid
       mistakes the same call simply needs to be put in all scripts and
       the program will automatically adapt its behaviour based on the
       environment variable <b>DPKG_MAINTSCRIPT_NAME </b>and on the maintainer
       scripts arguments that you have to forward after a double hyphen.
