       The trace-cmd(1) reset command turns off all tracing of Ftrace.
       This will bring back the performance of the system before tracing
       was enabled. This is necessary since <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/trace-cmd-record.1.html">trace-cmd-record(1)</a>,
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/trace-cmd-stop.1.html">trace-cmd-stop(1)</a> and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/trace-cmd-extract.1.html">trace-cmd-extract(1)</a> do not disable the
       tracer, event after the data has been pulled from the buffers.
       The rational is that the user may want to manually enable the
       tracer with the Ftrace pseudo file system, or examine other parts
       of Ftrace to see what trace-cmd did. After the reset command
       happens, the data in the ring buffer, and the options that were
       used are all lost.
