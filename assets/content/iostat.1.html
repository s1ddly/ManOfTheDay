       The <b>iostat </b>command is used for monitoring system input/output
       device loading by observing the time the devices are active in
       relation to their average transfer rates. The <b>iostat </b>command
       generates reports that can be used to change system configuration
       to better balance the input/output load between physical disks.

       The first report generated by the <b>iostat </b>command provides
       statistics concerning the time since the system was booted,
       unless the <b>-y </b>option is used (in this case, this first report is
       omitted).  Each subsequent report covers the time since the
       previous report. All statistics are reported each time the <b>iostat</b>
       command is run. The report consists of a CPU header row followed
       by a row of CPU statistics. On multiprocessor systems, CPU
       statistics are calculated system-wide as averages among all
       processors. A device header row is displayed followed by a line
       of statistics for each device that is configured.

       The <i>interval</i> parameter specifies the amount of time in seconds
       between each report. The <i>count</i> parameter can be specified in
       conjunction with the <i>interval</i> parameter. If the <i>count</i> parameter
       is specified, the value of <i>count</i> determines the number of reports
       generated at <i>interval</i> seconds apart. If the <i>interval</i> parameter is
       specified without the <i>count</i> parameter, the <b>iostat </b>command
       generates reports continuously.
