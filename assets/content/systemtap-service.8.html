       The SystemTap initscript aims to provide a way to run scripts as
       a service and easily control them individually. Scripts can be
       configured to start upon manual request, or during system
       startup. On dracut-based systems, it is also possible to
       integrate scripts in the initramfs and have them start during
       early-boot.

       The SystemTap initscript can be invoked manually using the
       <b>systemtap-service </b>command. On systemd-based systems, the
       initscript is controlled by <b>systemctl </b>with the service file
       <b>systemtap.service</b>.

       There are various parameters and options available to modify
       global behaviour, as well as script behaviour. Dependencies
       between scripts can be established so that starting one starts
       others.

       The configuration file of the initscript is located at
       <b>${prefix}/etc/systemtap/config</b>. Acceptable parameters are
       detailed in the GLOBAL PARAMETERS section.

       Scripts must be placed in the <b>${prefix}/etc/systemtap/script.d</b>
       directory and must have a <b>.stp </b>extension. When referring to them
       on the command-line however, there in no need to include the <b>.stp</b>
       extension.  Script names can only contain alphanumeric characters
       (and '_') and must not start with a number. The scripts directory
       may be changed by setting the SCRIPT_PATH parameter in the
       configuration file.
