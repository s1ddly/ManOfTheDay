       <b>btrfs restore </b>is used to try to salvage files from a damaged
       filesystem and restore them into <i>&lt;path&gt;</i> or just list the
       subvolume tree roots. The filesystem image is not modified.

       If the filesystem is damaged and cannot be repaired by the other
       tools (<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/btrfs-check.8.html">btrfs-check(8)</a> or <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/btrfs-rescue.8.html">btrfs-rescue(8)</a>), <b>btrfs restore </b>could be
       used to retrieve file data, as far as the metadata are readable.
       The checks done by restore are less strict and the process is
       usually able to get far enough to retrieve data from the whole
       filesystem. This comes at a cost that some data might be
       incomplete or from older versions if theyâ€™re available.

       There are several options to attempt restoration of various file
       metadata type. You can try a dry run first to see how well the
       process goes and use further options to extend the set of
       restored metadata.

       For images with damaged tree structures, there are several
       options to point the process to some spare copy.

           <b>Note</b>
           It is recommended to read the following btrfs wiki page if
           your data is not salvaged with default option:
