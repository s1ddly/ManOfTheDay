       The <b>genl </b>utility provides a simple frontend to the generic
       netlink library. Although it's designed to support multiple
       <i>OBJECT</i>s, for now only the <b>ctrl </b>object is available, which is used
       to query the generic netlink controller.

   <b>ctrl</b>
       The generic netlink controller can be queried in various ways:

       <b>help   </b>This command just prints a help text for the <b>ctrl </b>object.

       <b>list   </b>Show the registered netlink users.

       <b>monitor</b>
              Listen for generic netlink notifications.

       <b>get    </b>Query the controller for a given user, identified either
              by <b>name </b>or <b>id</b>.
