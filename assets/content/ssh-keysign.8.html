     <b>ssh-keysign </b>is used by ssh(1) to access the local host keys and
     generate the digital signature required during host-based
     authentication.

     <b>ssh-keysign </b>is disabled by default and can only be enabled in the
     global client configuration file <i>/etc/ssh/ssh_config</i> by setting
     <b>EnableSSHKeysign </b>to “yes”.

     <b>ssh-keysign </b>is not intended to be invoked by the user, but from
     ssh(1).  See ssh(1) and sshd(8) for more information about host-
     based authentication.
