       one range, or many ranges separated by commas.  Selected input is
       written in the same order that it is read, and is written exactly
       once.  Each range is one of:

       N      N'th byte, character or field, counted from 1

       N-     from N'th byte, character or field, to end of line

       N-M    from N'th to M'th (included) byte, character or field

       <b>-M     </b>from first to M'th (included) byte, character or field
