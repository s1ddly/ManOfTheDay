       For each operand that names a file of a type other than directory
       or symbolic link to a directory, <i>ls</i> shall write the name of the
       file as well as any requested, associated information. For each
       operand that names a file of type directory, <i>ls</i> shall write the
       names of files contained within the directory as well as any
       requested, associated information. Filenames beginning with a
       &lt;period&gt; (<b>'.'</b>)  and any associated information shall not be
       written out unless explicitly referenced, the <b>-A </b>or <b>-a </b>option is
       supplied, or an implementation-defined condition causes them to
       be written. If one or more of the <b>-d</b>, <b>-F</b>, or <b>-l </b>options are
       specified, and neither the <b>-H </b>nor the <b>-L </b>option is specified, for
       each operand that names a file of type symbolic link to a
       directory, <i>ls</i> shall write the name of the file as well as any
       requested, associated information. If none of the <b>-d</b>, <b>-F</b>, or <b>-l</b>
       options are specified, or the <b>-H </b>or <b>-L </b>options are specified, for
       each operand that names a file of type symbolic link to a
       directory, <i>ls</i> shall write the names of files contained within the
       directory as well as any requested, associated information. In
       each case where the names of files contained within a directory
       are written, if the directory contains any symbolic links then <i>ls</i>
       shall evaluate the file information and file type to be those of
       the symbolic link itself, unless the <b>-L </b>option is specified.

       If no operands are specified, <i>ls</i> shall behave as if a single
       operand of dot (<b>'.'</b>)  had been specified. If more than one
       operand is specified, <i>ls</i> shall write non-directory operands
       first; it shall sort directory and non-directory operands
       separately according to the collating sequence in the current
       locale.

       Whenever <i>ls</i> sorts filenames or pathnames according to the
       collating sequence in the current locale, if this collating
       sequence does not have a total ordering of all characters (see
       the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‚Äê2017, <i>Section 7.3.2</i>,
       <i>LC_COLLATE</i>), then any filenames or pathnames that collate equally
       should be further compared byte-by-byte using the collating
       sequence for the POSIX locale.

       The <i>ls</i> utility shall detect infinite loops; that is, entering a
       previously visited directory that is an ancestor of the last file
       encountered.  When it detects an infinite loop, <i>ls</i> shall write a
       diagnostic message to standard error and shall either recover its
       position in the hierarchy or terminate.
