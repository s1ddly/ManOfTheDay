       Use <b>git mergetool </b>to run one of several merge utilities to
       resolve merge conflicts. It is typically run after <i>git merge</i>.

       If one or more &lt;file&gt; parameters are given, the merge tool
       program will be run to resolve differences on each file (skipping
       those without conflicts). Specifying a directory will include all
       unresolved files in that path. If no &lt;file&gt; names are specified,
       <i>git mergetool</i> will run the merge tool program on every file with
       merge conflicts.
