       <b>sa </b>summarizes information about previously executed commands as
       recorded in the <i>acct</i> file.  In addition, it condenses this data
       into a summary file named <i>savacct</i> which contains the number of
       times the command was called and the system resources used.  The
       information can also be summarized on a per-user basis; <b>sa </b>will
       save this information into a file named <i>usracct.</i>

       If no arguments are specified, <b>sa </b>will print information about
       all of the commands in the <i>acct</i> file.

       If called with a file name as the last argument, <b>sa </b>will use that
       file instead of the system's default <i>acct</i> file.

       By default, <b>sa </b>will sort the output by sum of user and system
       time.  If command names have unprintable characters, or are only
       called once, <b>sa </b>will sort them into a group called `***other'.
       If more than one sorting option is specified, the list will be
       sorted by the one specified last on the command line.

       The output fields are labeled as follows:

       <i>cpu</i>
               sum of system and user time in cpu minutes

       <i>re</i>
               "elapsed time" in minutes

       <i>k</i>
               cpu-time averaged core usage, in 1k units

       <i>avio</i>
               average number of I/O operations per execution

       <i>tio</i>
               total number of I/O operations

       <i>k*sec</i>
               cpu storage integral (kilo-core seconds)

       <i>u</i>
               user cpu time in cpu seconds

       <i>s</i>
               system time in cpu seconds

       Note that these column titles do not appear in the first row of
       the table, but after each numeric entry (as units of measurement)
       in every row.  For example, you might see `79.29re', meaning
       79.29 cpu seconds of "real time".

       An asterisk will appear after the name of commands that forked
       but didn't call <b>exec.</b>

       GNU <b>sa </b>takes care to implement a number of features not found in
       other versions.  For example, most versions of <b>sa </b>don't pay
       attention to flags like `--print-seconds' and `--sort-num-calls'
       when printing out commands when combined with the `--user-
       summary' or `--print-users' flags.  GNU <b>sa </b>pays attention to
       these flags if they are applicable.  Also, MIPS' <b>sa </b>stores the
       average memory use as a short rather than a double, resulting in
       some round-off errors.  GNU <b>sa </b>uses double the whole way through.
