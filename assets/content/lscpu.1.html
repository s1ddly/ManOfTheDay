       <b>lscpu </b>gathers CPU architecture information from <i>sysfs</i>,
       <i>/proc/cpuinfo</i> and any applicable architecture-specific libraries
       (e.g. <b>librtas </b>on Powerpc). The command output can be optimized
       for parsing or for easy readability by humans. The information
       includes, for example, the number of CPUs, threads, cores,
       sockets, and Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) nodes. There is
       also information about the CPU caches and cache sharing, family,
       model, bogoMIPS, byte order, and stepping.

       The default output formatting on terminal is subject to change
       and maybe optimized for better readability. The output for
       non-terminals (e.g., pipes) is never affected by this
       optimization and it is always in "Field: data\n" format. Use for
       example "<b>lscpu | less</b>" to see the default output without
       optimizations.

       In virtualized environments, the CPU architecture information
       displayed reflects the configuration of the guest operating
       system which is typically different from the physical (host)
       system. On architectures that support retrieving physical
       topology information, <b>lscpu </b>also displays the number of physical
       sockets, chips, cores in the host system.

       Options that result in an output table have a <i>list</i> argument. Use
       this argument to customize the command output. Specify a
       comma-separated list of column labels to limit the output table
       to only the specified columns, arranged in the specified order.
       See <b>COLUMNS </b>for a list of valid column labels. The column labels
       are not case sensitive.

       Not all columns are supported on all architectures. If an
       unsupported column is specified, <b>lscpu </b>prints the column but does
       not provide any data for it.

       The cache sizes are reported as summary from all CPUs. The
       versions before v2.34 reported per-core sizes, but this output
       was confusing due to complicated CPUs topology and the way how
       caches are shared between CPUs. For more details about caches see
       <b>--cache</b>. Since version v2.37 <b>lscpu </b>follows cache IDs as provided
       by Linux kernel and it does not always start from zero.
