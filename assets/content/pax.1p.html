<pre>
       The <i>pax</i> utility shall read, write, and write lists of the members
       of archive files and copy directory hierarchies. A variety of
       archive formats shall be supported; see the <b>-x </b><i>format</i> option.

       The action to be taken depends on the presence of the <b>-r </b>and <b>-w</b>
       options. The four combinations of <b>-r </b>and <b>-w </b>are referred to as
       the four modes of operation: <b>list</b>, <b>read</b>, <b>write</b>, and <b>copy </b>modes,
       corresponding respectively to the four forms shown in the
       SYNOPSIS section.

       <b>list      </b>In <b>list </b>mode (when neither <b>-r </b>nor <b>-w </b>are specified),
                 <i>pax</i> shall write the names of the members of the archive
                 file read from the standard input, with pathnames
                 matching the specified patterns, to standard output. If
                 a named file is of type directory, the file hierarchy
                 rooted at that file shall be listed as well.

       <b>read      </b>In <b>read </b>mode (when <b>-r </b>is specified, but <b>-w </b>is not), <i>pax</i>
                 shall extract the members of the archive file read from
                 the standard input, with pathnames matching the
                 specified patterns. If an extracted file is of type
                 directory, the file hierarchy rooted at that file shall
                 be extracted as well. The extracted files shall be
                 created performing pathname resolution with the
                 directory in which <i>pax</i> was invoked as the current
                 working directory.

                 If an attempt is made to extract a directory when the
                 directory already exists, this shall not be considered
                 an error. If an attempt is made to extract a FIFO when
                 the FIFO already exists, this shall not be considered
                 an error.

                 The ownership, access, and modification times, and file
                 mode of the restored files are discussed under the <b>-p</b>
                 option.

       <b>write     </b>In <b>write </b>mode (when <b>-w </b>is specified, but <b>-r </b>is not),
                 <i>pax</i> shall write the contents of the <i>file</i> operands to
                 the standard output in an archive format. If no <i>file</i>
                 operands are specified, a list of files to copy, one
                 per line, shall be read from the standard input and
                 each entry in this list shall be processed as if it had
                 been a <i>file</i> operand on the command line. A file of type
                 directory shall include all of the files in the file
                 hierarchy rooted at the file.

       <b>copy      </b>In <b>copy </b>mode (when both <b>-r </b>and <b>-w </b>are specified), <i>pax</i>
                 shall copy the <i>file</i> operands to the destination
                 directory.

                 If no <i>file</i> operands are specified, a list of files to
                 copy, one per line, shall be read from the standard
                 input. A file of type directory shall include all of
                 the files in the file hierarchy rooted at the file.

                 The effect of the <b>copy </b>shall be as if the copied files
                 were written to a <i>pax</i> format archive file and then
                 subsequently extracted, except that copying of sockets
                 may be supported even if archiving them in write mode
                 is not supported, and that there may be hard links
                 between the original and the copied files. If the
                 destination directory is a subdirectory of one of the
                 files to be copied, the results are unspecified. If the
                 destination directory is a file of a type not defined
                 by the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017, the
                 results are implementation-defined; otherwise, it shall
                 be an error for the file named by the <i>directory</i> operand
                 not to exist, not be writable by the user, or not be a
                 file of type directory.

       In <b>read </b>or <b>copy </b>modes, if intermediate directories are necessary
       to extract an archive member, <i>pax</i> shall perform actions
       equivalent to the <i>mkdir</i>() function defined in the System
       Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017, called with the following
       arguments:

        *  The intermediate directory used as the <i>path</i> argument

        *  The value of the bitwise-inclusive OR of S_IRWXU, S_IRWXG,
           and S_IRWXO as the <i>mode</i> argument

       If any specified <i>pattern</i> or <i>file</i> operands are not matched by at
       least one file or archive member, <i>pax</i> shall write a diagnostic
       message to standard error for each one that did not match and
       exit with a non-zero exit status.

       The archive formats described in the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section
       shall be automatically detected on input. The default output
       archive format shall be implementation-defined.

       A single archive can span multiple files. The <i>pax</i> utility shall
       determine, in an implementation-defined manner, what file to read
       or write as the next file.

       If the selected archive format supports the specification of
       linked files, it shall be an error if these files cannot be
       linked when the archive is extracted. For archive formats that do
       not store file contents with each name that causes a hard link,
       if the file that contains the data is not extracted during this
       <i>pax</i> session, either the data shall be restored from the original
       file, or a diagnostic message shall be displayed with the name of
       a file that can be used to extract the data. In traversing
       directories, <i>pax</i> shall detect infinite loops; that is, entering a
       previously visited directory that is an ancestor of the last file
       visited. When it detects an infinite loop, <i>pax</i> shall write a
       diagnostic message to standard error and shall terminate.
