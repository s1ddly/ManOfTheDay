       <b>mount.nfs </b>is a part of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/nfs.5.html">nfs(5)</a> utilities package, which provides
       NFS client functionality.

       <b>mount.nfs </b>is meant to be used by the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/mount.8.html">mount(8)</a> command for
       mounting NFS shares. This subcommand, however, can also be used
       as a standalone command with limited functionality.

       <i>remotetarget</i> is a server share usually in the form of
       <b>servername:/path/to/share.  </b><i>dir</i> is the directory on which the
       file system is to be mounted.

       Under Linux 2.6.32 and later kernel versions, <b>mount.nfs </b>can mount
       all NFS file system versions.  Under earlier Linux kernel
       versions, <b>mount.nfs4 </b>must be used for mounting NFSv4 file systems
       while <b>mount.nfs </b>must be used for NFSv3 and v2.
