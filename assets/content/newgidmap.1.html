       The <b>newgidmap </b>sets /proc/[pid]/gid_map based on its command line
       arguments and the gids allowed. Subgid delegation can either be
       managed via /etc/subgid or through the configured NSS subid
       module. These options are mutually exclusive.

       Note that the root group is not exempted from the requirement for
       a valid /etc/subgid entry.

       After the pid argument, <b>newgidmap </b>expects sets of 3 integers:

       gid
           Beginning of the range of GIDs inside the user namespace.

       lowergid
           Beginning of the range of GIDs outside the user namespace.

       count
           Length of the ranges (both inside and outside the user
           namespace).

       <b>newgidmap </b>verifies that the caller is the owner of the process
       indicated by <b>pid </b>and that for each of the above sets, each of the
       GIDs in the range [lowergid, lowergid+count) is allowed to the
       caller according to /etc/subgid before setting
       /proc/[pid]/gid_map.

       Note that newgidmap may be used only once for a given process.
