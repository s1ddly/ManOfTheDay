       <b>dh_missing </b>compares the list of installed files with the files in
       the source directory. If any of the files (and symlinks) in the
       source directory were not installed to somewhere, it will warn on
       stderr about that (<b>--list-missing</b>) or fail (<b>--fail-missing</b>).

       Please note that in compat 11 and earlier without either of these
       options, <b>dh_missing </b>will silently do nothing.  In compat 12,
       <b>--list-missing </b>is the default  In compat 13 and later,
       <b>--fail-missing </b>is the default.

       This may be useful if you have a large package and want to make
       sure that you don't miss installing newly added files in new
       upstream releases.

       Remember to test different kinds of builds (dpkg-buildpackage
       -A/-B/...) as you may experience varying results when only a
       subset of the packages are built.
