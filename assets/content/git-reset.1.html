<pre>
       In the first three forms, copy entries from <b>&lt;tree-ish&gt; </b>to the
       index. In the last form, set the current branch head (<b>HEAD</b>) to
       <b>&lt;commit&gt;</b>, optionally modifying index and working tree to match.
       The <b>&lt;tree-ish&gt;</b>/<b>&lt;commit&gt; </b>defaults to <b>HEAD </b>in all forms.

       <i>git reset</i> [-q] [&lt;tree-ish&gt;] [--] &lt;pathspec&gt;..., <i>git reset</i> [-q]
       [--pathspec-from-file=&lt;file&gt; [--pathspec-file-nul]] [&lt;tree-ish&gt;]
           These forms reset the index entries for all paths that match
           the <b>&lt;pathspec&gt; </b>to their state at <b>&lt;tree-ish&gt;</b>. (It does not
           affect the working tree or the current branch.)

           This means that <b>git reset &lt;pathspec&gt; </b>is the opposite of <b>git</b>
           <b>add &lt;pathspec&gt;</b>. This command is equivalent to <b>git restore</b>
           <b>[--source=&lt;tree-ish&gt;] --staged &lt;pathspec&gt;...</b>.

           After running <b>git reset &lt;pathspec&gt; </b>to update the index entry,
           you can use <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/git-restore.1.html">git-restore(1)</a> to check the contents out of the
           index to the working tree. Alternatively, using
           <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/git-restore.1.html">git-restore(1)</a> and specifying a commit with <b>--source</b>, you can
           copy the contents of a path out of a commit to the index and
           to the working tree in one go.

       <i>git reset</i> (--patch | -p) [&lt;tree-ish&gt;] [--] [&lt;pathspec&gt;...]
           Interactively select hunks in the difference between the
           index and <b>&lt;tree-ish&gt; </b>(defaults to <b>HEAD</b>). The chosen hunks are
           applied in reverse to the index.

           This means that <b>git reset -p </b>is the opposite of <b>git add -p</b>,
           i.e. you can use it to selectively reset hunks. See the
           “Interactive Mode” section of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/git-add.1.html">git-add(1)</a> to learn how to
           operate the <b>--patch </b>mode.

       <i>git reset</i> [&lt;mode&gt;] [&lt;commit&gt;]
           This form resets the current branch head to <b>&lt;commit&gt; </b>and
           possibly updates the index (resetting it to the tree of
           <b>&lt;commit&gt;</b>) and the working tree depending on <b>&lt;mode&gt;</b>. If <b>&lt;mode&gt;</b>
           is omitted, defaults to <b>--mixed</b>. The <b>&lt;mode&gt; </b>must be one of
           the following:

           --soft
               Does not touch the index file or the working tree at all
               (but resets the head to <b>&lt;commit&gt;</b>, just like all modes
               do). This leaves all your changed files "Changes to be
               committed", as <b>git status </b>would put it.

           --mixed
               Resets the index but not the working tree (i.e., the
               changed files are preserved but not marked for commit)
               and reports what has not been updated. This is the
               default action.

               If <b>-N </b>is specified, removed paths are marked as
               intent-to-add (see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/git-add.1.html">git-add(1)</a>).

           --hard
               Resets the index and working tree. Any changes to tracked
               files in the working tree since <b>&lt;commit&gt; </b>are discarded.

           --merge
               Resets the index and updates the files in the working
               tree that are different between <b>&lt;commit&gt; </b>and <b>HEAD</b>, but
               keeps those which are different between the index and
               working tree (i.e. which have changes which have not been
               added). If a file that is different between <b>&lt;commit&gt; </b>and
               the index has unstaged changes, reset is aborted.

               In other words, <b>--merge </b>does something like a <b>git</b>
               <b>read-tree -u -m &lt;commit&gt;</b>, but carries forward unmerged
               index entries.

           --keep
               Resets index entries and updates files in the working
               tree that are different between <b>&lt;commit&gt; </b>and <b>HEAD</b>. If a
               file that is different between <b>&lt;commit&gt; </b>and <b>HEAD </b>has
               local changes, reset is aborted.

           --[no-]recurse-submodules
               When the working tree is updated, using
               --recurse-submodules will also recursively reset the
               working tree of all active submodules according to the
               commit recorded in the superproject, also setting the
               submodules' HEAD to be detached at that commit.

       See "Reset, restore and revert" in <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/git.1.html">git(1)</a> for the differences
       between the three commands.
