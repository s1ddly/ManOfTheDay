       The <b>rev </b>utility copies the specified files to standard output,
       reversing the order of characters in every line. If no files are
       specified, standard input is read.

       This utility is a line-oriented tool and it uses in-memory
       allocated buffer for a whole wide-char line. If the input file is
       huge and without line breaks than allocate the memory for the
       file may be unsuccessful.
