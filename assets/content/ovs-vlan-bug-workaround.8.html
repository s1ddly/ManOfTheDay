       Some Linux network drivers support a feature called ``VLAN
       acceleration''.  VLAN acceleration is associated with a data
       structure called a <b>vlan_group </b>that is, abstractly, a dictionary
       that maps from a VLAN ID (in the range 0 to 4095) to a VLAN
       device, that is, a Linux network device associated with a
       particular VLAN, e.g. <b>eth0.9 </b>for VLAN 9 on <b>eth0</b>.

       Some drivers that support VLAN acceleration have bugs that fall
       roughly into the categories listed below.  <b>ovs-vlan-test</b>(8) can
       test for these driver bugs.

       •      When NICs use VLAN stripping on receive they must pass a
              pointer to a <b>vlan_group </b>when reporting the stripped tag to
              the networking core.  If no <b>vlan_group </b>is in use then some
              drivers just drop the extracted tag.  Drivers are supposed
              to only enable stripping if a <b>vlan_group </b>is registered but
              not all of them do that.

       •      On receive, some drivers handle priority tagged packets
              specially and don't pass the tag onto the network stack at
              all, so Open vSwitch never has a chance to see it.

       •      Some drivers size their receive buffers based on whether a
              <b>vlan_group </b>is enabled, meaning that a maximum size packet
              with a VLAN tag will not fit if no <b>vlan_group </b>is
              configured.

       •      On transmit, some drivers expect that VLAN acceleration
              will be used if it is available, which can only be done if
              a <b>vlan_group </b>is configured.  In these cases, the driver
              may fail to parse the packet and correctly setup checksum
              offloading or TSO.

       The correct long term solution is to fix these driver bugs.

       For now, <b>ovs-vlan-bug-workaround </b>can enable a special-purpose
       workaround for devices with buggy VLAN acceleration.  A kernel
       patch must be applied for this workaround to work.

       Use the command <b>ovs-vlan-bug-workaround </b><i>netdev</i> <b>on </b>to enable the
       VLAN driver bug workaround for network device <i>netdev</i>.  Use the
       command <b>ovs-vlan-bug-workaround </b><i>netdev</i> <b>off </b>to disable the VLAN
       driver bug workaround for network device <i>netdev</i>.
