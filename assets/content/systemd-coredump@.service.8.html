       systemd-coredump@.service is a system service to process core
       dumps. It will log a summary of the event to
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/systemd-journald.service.8.html">systemd-journald.service(8)</a>, including information about the
       process identifier, owner, the signal that killed the process,
       and the stack trace if possible. It may also save the core dump
       for later processing. See the "Information about the crashed
       process" section below.

       The behavior of a specific program upon reception of a signal is
       governed by a few factors which are described in detail in
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/core.5.html">core(5)</a>. In particular, the core dump will only be processed when
       the related resource limits are sufficient.

       Core dumps can be written to the journal or saved as a file. In
       both cases, they can be retrieved for further processing, for
       example in <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/gdb.1.html">gdb(1)</a>. See <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/coredumpctl.1.html">coredumpctl(1)</a>, in particular the <b>list </b>and
       <b>debug </b>verbs.

       By default, <b>systemd-coredump </b>will log the core dump to the
       journal, including a backtrace if possible, and store the core
       dump (an image of the memory contents of the process) itself in
       an external file in /var/lib/systemd/coredump. These core dumps
       are deleted after a few days by default; see
       /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/systemd.conf for details. Note that the
       removal of core files from the file system and the purging of
       journal entries are independent, and the core file may be present
       without the journal entry, and journal entries may point to
       since-removed core files. Some metadata is attached to core files
       in the form of extended attributes, so the core files are useful
       for some purposes even without the full metadata available in the
       journal entry.

   <b>Invocation of systemd-coredump</b>
       The <b>systemd-coredump </b>executable does the actual work. It is
       invoked twice: once as the handler by the kernel, and the second
       time in the systemd-coredump@.service to actually write the data
       to the journal and process and save the core file.

       When the kernel invokes <b>systemd-coredump </b>to handle a core dump,
       it runs in privileged mode, and will connect to the socket
       created by the systemd-coredump.socket unit, which in turn will
       spawn an unprivileged systemd-coredump@.service instance to
       process the core dump. Hence systemd-coredump.socket and
       systemd-coredump@.service are helper units which do the actual
       processing of core dumps and are subject to normal service
       management.

       It is also possible to invoke <b>systemd-coredump </b>with <b>--backtrace</b>
       option. In this case, <b>systemd-coredump </b>expects a journal entry in
       the journal <b>Journal Export Format</b><b></b>[1] on standard input. The entry
       should contain a <i>MESSAGE=</i> field and any additional metadata
       fields the caller deems reasonable.  <b>systemd-coredump </b>will append
       additional metadata fields in the same way it does for core dumps
       received from the kernel. In this mode, no core dump is stored in
       the journal.
