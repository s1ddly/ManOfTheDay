       <b>pmdamounts </b>is a simple Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA)
       which monitors availability of a given set of filesystem mounts.

       The <b>mounts </b>PMDA exports metrics that reflect whether the
       configured filesystems are mounted ("up") or not.  The list of
       mount points to monitor is specified via the
       <i>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mounts/mounts.conf</i> file which simply contains one
       line for each mount point.

       A brief description of the <b>pmdamounts </b>command line options
       follows:

       <b>-d   </b>It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics <i>domain</i>
            number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is,
            <i>domain</i> should be different for every PMDA on the one host,
            and the same <i>domain</i> number should be used for the same PMDA
            on all hosts.

       <b>-l   </b>Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
            <i>mounts.log</i> is written in the current directory of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a>
            when <b>pmdamounts </b>is started, i.e.  <b>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd</b>.  If the
            log file cannot be created or is not writable, output is
            written to the standard error instead.

       <b>-U   </b>User account under which to run the agent.  The default is
            the unprivileged "pcp" account in current versions of PCP,
            but in older versions the superuser account ("root") was
            used by default.
