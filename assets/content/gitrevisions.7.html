       Many Git commands take revision parameters as arguments.
       Depending on the command, they denote a specific commit or, for
       commands which walk the revision graph (such as <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/git-log.1.html">git-log(1)</a>), all
       commits which are reachable from that commit. For commands that
       walk the revision graph one can also specify a range of revisions
       explicitly.

       In addition, some Git commands (such as <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/git-show.1.html">git-show(1)</a> and
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/git-push.1.html">git-push(1)</a>) can also take revision parameters which denote other
       objects than commits, e.g. blobs ("files") or trees ("directories
       of files").
