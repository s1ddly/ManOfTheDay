       Show changes between the working tree and the index or a tree,
       changes between the index and a tree, changes between two trees,
       changes resulting from a merge, changes between two blob objects,
       or changes between two files on disk.

       <i>git diff</i> [&lt;options&gt;] [--] [&lt;path&gt;...]
           This form is to view the changes you made relative to the
           index (staging area for the next commit). In other words, the
           differences are what you <i>could</i> tell Git to further add to the
           index but you still havenâ€™t. You can stage these changes by
           using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/git-add.1.html">git-add(1)</a>.

       <i>git diff</i> [&lt;options&gt;] --no-index [--] &lt;path&gt; &lt;path&gt;
           This form is to compare the given two paths on the
           filesystem. You can omit the <b>--no-index </b>option when running
           the command in a working tree controlled by Git and at least
           one of the paths points outside the working tree, or when
           running the command outside a working tree controlled by Git.
           This form implies <b>--exit-code</b>.

       <i>git diff</i> [&lt;options&gt;] --cached [--merge-base] [&lt;commit&gt;] [--]
       [&lt;path&gt;...]
           This form is to view the changes you staged for the next
           commit relative to the named &lt;commit&gt;. Typically you would
           want comparison with the latest commit, so if you do not give
           &lt;commit&gt;, it defaults to HEAD. If HEAD does not exist (e.g.
           unborn branches) and &lt;commit&gt; is not given, it shows all
           staged changes. --staged is a synonym of --cached.

           If --merge-base is given, instead of using &lt;commit&gt;, use the
           merge base of &lt;commit&gt; and HEAD.  <b>git diff --cached</b>
           <b>--merge-base A </b>is equivalent to <b>git diff --cached $(git</b>
           <b>merge-base A HEAD)</b>.

       <i>git diff</i> [&lt;options&gt;] [--merge-base] &lt;commit&gt; [--] [&lt;path&gt;...]
           This form is to view the changes you have in your working
           tree relative to the named &lt;commit&gt;. You can use HEAD to
           compare it with the latest commit, or a branch name to
           compare with the tip of a different branch.

           If --merge-base is given, instead of using &lt;commit&gt;, use the
           merge base of &lt;commit&gt; and HEAD.  <b>git diff --merge-base A </b>is
           equivalent to <b>git diff $(git merge-base A HEAD)</b>.

       <i>git diff</i> [&lt;options&gt;] [--merge-base] &lt;commit&gt; &lt;commit&gt; [--]
       [&lt;path&gt;...]
           This is to view the changes between two arbitrary &lt;commit&gt;.

           If --merge-base is given, use the merge base of the two
           commits for the "before" side.  <b>git diff --merge-base A B </b>is
           equivalent to <b>git diff $(git merge-base A B) B</b>.

       <i>git diff</i> [&lt;options&gt;] &lt;commit&gt; &lt;commit&gt;... &lt;commit&gt; [--]
       [&lt;path&gt;...]
           This form is to view the results of a merge commit. The first
           listed &lt;commit&gt; must be the merge itself; the remaining two
           or more commits should be its parents. A convenient way to
           produce the desired set of revisions is to use the <b>^@ </b>suffix.
           For instance, if <b>master </b>names a merge commit, <b>git diff master</b>
           <b>master^@ </b>gives the same combined diff as <b>git show master</b>.

       <i>git diff</i> [&lt;options&gt;] &lt;commit&gt;..&lt;commit&gt; [--] [&lt;path&gt;...]
           This is synonymous to the earlier form (without the <b>..</b>) for
           viewing the changes between two arbitrary &lt;commit&gt;. If
           &lt;commit&gt; on one side is omitted, it will have the same effect
           as using HEAD instead.

       <i>git diff</i> [&lt;options&gt;] &lt;commit&gt;...&lt;commit&gt; [--] [&lt;path&gt;...]
           This form is to view the changes on the branch containing and
           up to the second &lt;commit&gt;, starting at a common ancestor of
           both &lt;commit&gt;.  <b>git diff A...B </b>is equivalent to <b>git diff</b>
           <b>$(git merge-base A B) B</b>. You can omit any one of &lt;commit&gt;,
           which has the same effect as using HEAD instead.

       Just in case you are doing something exotic, it should be noted
       that all of the &lt;commit&gt; in the above description, except in the
       <b>--merge-base </b>case and in the last two forms that use <b>..</b>
       notations, can be any &lt;tree&gt;.

       For a more complete list of ways to spell &lt;commit&gt;, see
       "SPECIFYING REVISIONS" section in <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/gitrevisions.7.html">gitrevisions(7)</a>. However,
       "diff" is about comparing two <i>endpoints</i>, not ranges, and the
       range notations (<b>&lt;commit&gt;..&lt;commit&gt; </b>and <b>&lt;commit&gt;...&lt;commit&gt;</b>) do
       not mean a range as defined in the "SPECIFYING RANGES" section in
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/gitrevisions.7.html">gitrevisions(7)</a>.

       <i>git diff</i> [&lt;options&gt;] &lt;blob&gt; &lt;blob&gt;
           This form is to view the differences between the raw contents
           of two blob objects.
