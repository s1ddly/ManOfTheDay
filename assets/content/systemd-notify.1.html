       <b>systemd-notify </b>may be called by daemon scripts to notify the init
       system about status changes. It can be used to send arbitrary
       information, encoded in an environment-block-like list of
       strings. Most importantly, it can be used for start-up completion
       notification.

       This is mostly just a wrapper around <b>sd_notify() </b>and makes this
       functionality available to shell scripts. For details see
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/sd_notify.3.html">sd_notify(3)</a>.

       The command line may carry a list of environment variables to
       send as part of the status update.

       Note that systemd will refuse reception of status updates from
       this command unless <i>NotifyAccess=</i> is set for the service unit
       this command is called from.

       Note that <b>sd_notify() </b>notifications may be attributed to units
       correctly only if either the sending process is still around at
       the time PID 1 processes the message, or if the sending process
       is explicitly runtime-tracked by the service manager. The latter
       is the case if the service manager originally forked off the
       process, i.e. on all processes that match <i>NotifyAccess=</i><b>main </b>or
       <i>NotifyAccess=</i><b>exec</b>. Conversely, if an auxiliary process of the
       unit sends an <b>sd_notify() </b>message and immediately exits, the
       service manager might not be able to properly attribute the
       message to the unit, and thus will ignore it, even if
       <i>NotifyAccess=</i><b>all </b>is set for it. When <b>--no-block </b>is used, all
       synchronization for reception of notifications is disabled, and
       hence the aforementioned race may occur if the invoking process
       is not the service manager or spawned by the service manager.

       Hence, <b>systemd-notify </b>will first attempt to invoke <b>sd_notify()</b>
       pretending to have the PID of the invoking process. This will
       only succeed when invoked with sufficient privileges. On failure,
       it will then fall back to invoking it under its own PID. This
       behaviour is useful in order that when the tool is invoked from a
       shell script the shell process — and not the <b>systemd-notify</b>
       process — appears as sender of the message, which in turn is
       helpful if the shell process is the main process of a service,
       due to the limitations of <i>NotifyAccess=</i><b>all</b>. Use the <b>--pid= </b>switch
       to tweak this behaviour.
