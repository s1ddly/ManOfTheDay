       <b>nss-systemd </b>is a plug-in module for the GNU Name Service Switch
       (NSS) functionality of the GNU C Library (<b>glibc</b>), providing UNIX
       user and group name resolution for services implementing the
       <b>User/Group Record Lookup API via Varlink</b><b></b>[1], such as the system
       and service manager <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/systemd.1.html">systemd(1)</a> (for its <i>DynamicUser=</i> feature, see
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/systemd.exec.5.html">systemd.exec(5)</a> for details), <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/systemd-homed.service.8.html">systemd-homed.service(8)</a>, or
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/systemd-machined.service.8.html">systemd-machined.service(8)</a>.

       This module also ensures that the root and nobody users and
       groups (i.e. the users/groups with the UIDs/GIDs 0 and 65534)
       remain resolvable at all times, even if they aren't listed in
       /etc/passwd or /etc/group, or if these files are missing.

       This module preferably utilizes <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/systemd-userdbd.service.8.html">systemd-userdbd.service(8)</a> for
       resolving users and groups, but also works without the service
       running.

       To activate the NSS module, add "systemd" to the lines starting
       with "passwd:", "group:", "shadow:" and "gshadow:" in
       /etc/nsswitch.conf.

       It is recommended to place "systemd" after the "files" or
       "compat" entry of the /etc/nsswitch.conf lines so that
       /etc/passwd, /etc/group, /etc/shadow and /etc/gshadow based
       mappings take precedence.
