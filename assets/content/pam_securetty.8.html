       pam_securetty is a PAM module that allows root logins only if the
       user is logging in on a "secure" tty, as defined by the listing
       in /etc/securetty. pam_securetty also checks to make sure that
       /etc/securetty is a plain file and not world writable. It will
       also allow root logins on the tty specified with <b>console= </b>switch
       on the kernel command line and on ttys from the
       /sys/class/tty/console/active.

       This module has no effect on non-root users and requires that the
       application fills in the <b>PAM_TTY </b>item correctly.

       For canonical usage, should be listed as a <b>required</b>
       authentication method before any <b>sufficient </b>authentication
       methods.
