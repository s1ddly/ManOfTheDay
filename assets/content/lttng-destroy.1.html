       The <b>lttng destroy </b>command destroys one or more tracing sessions.

       If no options are specified, the current tracing session is
       destroyed (see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/lttng-create.1.html">lttng-create(1)</a> for more information about the
       current tracing session).

       If <i>SESSION</i> is specified, the existing tracing session named
       <i>SESSION</i> is destroyed. <b>lttng list </b>outputs all the existing tracing
       sessions (see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/lttng-list.1.html">lttng-list(1)</a>).

       If the <b>--all </b>option is used, <b>all </b>the tracing sessions, as listed
       in the output of <b>lttng list</b>, are destroyed.

       Destroying a tracing session stops any tracing running within the
       latter. By default, the implicit <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/lttng-stop.1.html">lttng-stop(1)</a> command invoked by
       the <b>lttng destroy </b>command ensures that the tracing session’s
       trace data is valid before returning. With the <b>--no-wait </b>option,
       the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/lttng-stop.1.html">lttng-stop(1)</a> command finishes immediately, hence a local
       trace might not be valid when the command is done. In this case,
       there is no way to know when the trace becomes valid.

       Destroying a tracing session does not destroy the recorded trace
       data, if any; it frees resources acquired by the session daemon
       and tracer side, making sure to flush all trace data.

       If at least one rotation occurred during the chosen tracing
       session’s lifetime (see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/lttng-rotate.1.html">lttng-rotate(1)</a> and
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/lttng-enable-rotation.1.html">lttng-enable-rotation(1)</a>), and without the <b>--no-wait </b>option, all
       the tracing session’s output directory’s subdirectories are
       considered trace chunk archives once the command returns: it is
       safe to read them, modify them, move them, or remove them.
