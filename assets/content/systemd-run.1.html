       <b>systemd-run </b>may be used to create and start a transient .service
       or .scope unit and run the specified <i>COMMAND</i> in it. It may also
       be used to create and start a transient .path, .socket, or .timer
       unit, that activates a .service unit when elapsing.

       If a command is run as transient service unit, it will be started
       and managed by the service manager like any other service, and
       thus shows up in the output of <b>systemctl list-units </b>like any
       other unit. It will run in a clean and detached execution
       environment, with the service manager as its parent process. In
       this mode, <b>systemd-run </b>will start the service asynchronously in
       the background and return after the command has begun execution
       (unless <b>--no-block </b>or <b>--wait </b>are specified, see below).

       If a command is run as transient scope unit, it will be executed
       by <b>systemd-run </b>itself as parent process and will thus inherit the
       execution environment of the caller. However, the processes of
       the command are managed by the service manager similar to normal
       services, and will show up in the output of <b>systemctl list-units</b>.
       Execution in this case is synchronous, and will return only when
       the command finishes. This mode is enabled via the <b>--scope </b>switch
       (see below).

       If a command is run with path, socket, or timer options such as
       <b>--on-calendar= </b>(see below), a transient path, socket, or timer
       unit is created alongside the service unit for the specified
       command. Only the transient path, socket, or timer unit is
       started immediately, the transient service unit will be triggered
       by the path, socket, or timer unit. If the <b>--unit= </b>option is
       specified, the <i>COMMAND</i> may be omitted. In this case, <b>systemd-run</b>
       creates only a .path, .socket, or .timer unit that triggers the
       specified unit.

       By default, services created with <b>systemd-run </b>default to the
       <b>simple </b>type, see the description of <i>Type=</i> in <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/systemd.service.5.html">systemd.service(5)</a>
       for details. Note that when this type is used the service manager
       (and thus the <b>systemd-run </b>command) considers service start-up
       successful as soon as the <b>fork() </b>for the main service process
       succeeded, i.e. before the <b>execve() </b>is invoked, and thus even if
       the specified command cannot be started. Consider using the <b>exec</b>
       service type (i.e.  <b>--property=Type=exec</b>) to ensure that
       <b>systemd-run </b>returns successfully only if the specified command
       line has been successfully started.
