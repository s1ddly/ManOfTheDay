       <b>This mkfs frontend is deprecated in favour of filesystem specific</b>
       <b>mkfs.&lt;type&gt; utils.</b>

       <b>mkfs </b>is used to build a Linux filesystem on a device, usually a
       hard disk partition. The <i>device</i> argument is either the device
       name (e.g., <i>/dev/hda1</i>, <i>/dev/sdb2</i>), or a regular file that shall
       contain the filesystem. The <i>size</i> argument is the number of blocks
       to be used for the filesystem.

       The exit status returned by <b>mkfs </b>is 0 on success and 1 on
       failure.

       In actuality, <b>mkfs </b>is simply a front-end for the various
       filesystem builders (<b>mkfs.</b><i>fstype</i>) available under Linux. The
       filesystem-specific builder is searched for via your <b>PATH</b>
       environment setting only. Please see the filesystem-specific
       builder manual pages for further details.
