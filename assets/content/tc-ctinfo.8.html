       CTINFO (Conntrack Information) is a tc action for retrieving data
       from conntrack marks into various fields.  At present it has two
       independent processing modes which may be viewed as sub-
       functions.

       DSCP mode copies a DSCP stored in conntrack's connmark into the
       IPv4/v6 diffserv field.  The copying may conditionally occur
       based on a flag also stored in the connmark.  DSCP mode was
       designed to assist in restoring packet classifications on
       ingress, classifications which may then be used by qdiscs such as
       CAKE.  It may be used in any circumstance where ingress
       classification needs to be maintained across links that otherwise
       bleach or remap according to their own policies.

       CPMARK (copymark) mode copies the conntrack connmark into the
       packet's mark field.  Without additional parameters it is
       functionally completely equivalent to the existing connmark
       action.  An optional mask may be specified to mask which bits of
       the connmark are restored.  This may be useful when DSCP and
       CPMARK modes are combined.

       Simple statistics (tc -s) on DSCP restores and CPMARK copies are
       maintained where values for set indicate a count of packets
       altered for that mode.  DSCP includes an error count where the
       destination packet's diffserv field was unwriteable.
