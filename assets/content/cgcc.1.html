       <b>cgcc </b>provides a wrapper around a C compiler (<b>cc </b>by default) which
       also invokes the Sparse static analysis tool.

       <b>cgcc </b>accepts all Sparse command-line options, such as warning
       options, and passes all other options through to the compiler.

       By providing the same interface as the C compiler, <b>cgcc </b>allows
       projects to run Sparse as part of their build without modifying
       their build system, by using <b>cgcc </b>as the compiler.  For many
       projects, setting <b>CC=cgcc </b>on the <b>make </b>command-line will work.
