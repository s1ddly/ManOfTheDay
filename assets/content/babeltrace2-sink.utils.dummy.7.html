       A Babeltrace 2 <b>sink.utils.dummy </b>component consumes messages and
       discards them (does absolutely nothing with them).

                       +------------------+
                       | sink.utils.dummy |
                       |                  |
           Messages --&gt;@ in               |
                       +------------------+

       See <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/babeltrace2-intro.7.html">babeltrace2-intro(7)</a> to learn more about the Babeltrace 2
       project and its core concepts.

       A <b>sink.utils.dummy </b>sink component can be useful to run a trace
       processing graph with no sink side effect, for example to perform
       benchmarks. Prefer a <b>sink.utils.dummy </b>component class for such
       tasks to, for example, a <b>sink.text.pretty </b>component and sending
       its output to <b>/dev/null</b>, as a <b>sink.text.pretty </b>component still
       performs formatting operations.
