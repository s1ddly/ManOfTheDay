       CAKE (Common Applications Kept Enhanced) is a shaping-capable
       queue discipline which uses both AQM and FQ.  It combines COBALT,
       which is an AQM algorithm combining Codel and BLUE, a shaper
       which operates in deficit mode, and a variant of DRR++ for flow
       isolation.  8-way set-associative hashing is used to virtually
       eliminate hash collisions.  Priority queuing is available through
       a simplified diffserv implementation.  Overhead compensation for
       various encapsulation schemes is tightly integrated.

       All settings are optional; the default settings are chosen to be
       sensible in most common deployments.  Most people will only need
       to set the <b>bandwidth </b>parameter to get useful results, but reading
       the <b>Overhead Compensation </b>and <b>Round Trip Time </b>sections is
       strongly encouraged.
