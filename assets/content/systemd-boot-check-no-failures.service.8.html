       systemd-boot-check-no-failures.service is a system service that
       checks whether the system booted up successfully. This service
       implements a very minimal test only: whether there are any failed
       units on the system. This service is disabled by default. When
       enabled, it is ordered before boot-complete.target, thus ensuring
       the target cannot be reached when the system booted up with
       failed services.

       Note that due the simple nature of this check this service is
       probably not suitable for deployment in most scenarios. It is
       primarily useful only as example for developing more fine-grained
       checks to order before boot-complete.target.
