<pre>
       The <i>uncompress</i> utility shall restore files to their original
       state after they have been compressed using the <i>compress</i> utility.
       If no files are specified, the standard input shall be
       uncompressed to the standard output. If the invoking process has
       appropriate privileges, the ownership, modes, access time, and
       modification time of the original file shall be preserved.

       This utility shall support the uncompressing of any files
       produced by the <i>compress</i> utility on the same implementation. For
       files produced by <i>compress</i> on other systems, <i>uncompress</i> supports
       9 to 14-bit compression (see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/compress.1p.html">compress(1p)</a>, <b>-b</b>); it is
       implementation-defined whether values of <b>-b </b>greater than 14 are
       supported.
