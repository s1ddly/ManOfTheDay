       This manual page documents briefly the <b>ifcfg </b>command.

       This is a simplistic script replacing one option of <b>ifconfig </b>,
       namely, IP address management. It not only adds addresses, but
       also carries out Duplicate Address Detection RFC-DHCP, sends
       unsolicited ARP to update the caches of other hosts sharing the
       interface, adds some control routes and restarts Router Discovery
       when it is necessary.
