       <b>chattr </b>changes the file attributes on a Linux file system.

       The format of a symbolic mode is +-=[aAcCdDeFijmPsStTux].

       The operator '+' causes the selected attributes to be added to
       the existing attributes of the files; '-' causes them to be
       removed; and '=' causes them to be the only attributes that the
       files have.

       The letters 'aAcCdDeFijmPsStTux' select the new attributes for
       the files: append only (a), no atime updates (A), compressed (c),
       no copy on write (C), no dump (d), synchronous directory updates
       (D), extent format (e), case-insensitive directory lookups (F),
       immutable (i), data journaling (j), don't compress (m), project
       hierarchy (P), secure deletion (s), synchronous updates (S), no
       tail-merging (t), top of directory hierarchy (T), undeletable
       (u), and direct access for files (x).

       The following attributes are read-only, and may be listed by
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/lsattr.1.html">lsattr(1)</a> but not modified by chattr: encrypted (E), indexed
       directory (I), inline data (N), and verity (V).

       Not all flags are supported or utilized by all file systems;
       refer to file system-specific man pages such as <b>btrfs</b>(5),
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/ext4.5.html">ext4(5)</a>, and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/xfs.5.html">xfs(5)</a> for more file system-specific details.
