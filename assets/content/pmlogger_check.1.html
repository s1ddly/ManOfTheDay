       These shell scripts and associated control files may be used to
       create a customized regime of administration and management for
       Performance Co-Pilot (see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/PCPIntro.1.html">PCPIntro(1)</a>) archive log files.

       <b>pmlogger_check </b>may be run at any time of the day and is intended
       to check that a desired set of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> processes are running.
       If not, it (re-)starts any missing logger processes.

       <b>pmlogger_daily </b>is intended to be run once per day, preferably in
       the early morning, as soon after midnight as practicable.  Its
       task is to aggregate, rotate and perform general housekeeping one
       or more sets of PCP archives.

       To accommodate the evolution of PMDAs and changes in production
       logging environments, <b>pmlogger_daily </b>is integrated with
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmlogrewrite.1.html">pmlogrewrite(1)</a> to allow optional and automatic rewriting of
       archives before merging.  If there are global rewriting rules to
       be applied across all archives mentioned in the control file(s),
       then create the directory <b>$PCP_SYSCONF_DIR/pmlogrewrite </b>and place
       any <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmlogrewrite.1.html">pmlogrewrite(1)</a> rewriting rules in this directory.  For
       rewriting rules that are specific to only one family of archives,
       use the directory name from the control file(s) - i.e. the <i>fourth</i>
       field - and create a file, or a directory, or a symbolic link
       named <b>pmlogrewrite </b>within this directory and place the required
       rewriting rule(s) in the <b>pmlogrewrite </b>file or in files within the
       <b>pmlogrewrite </b>subdirectory.  <b>pmlogger_daily </b>will choose rewriting
       rules from the archive directory if they exist, else rewriting
       rules from <b>$PCP_SYSCONF_DIR/pmlogrewrite </b>if that directory
       exists, else no rewriting is attempted.

       As an alternate mechanism, if the file
       <b>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmlogger/.NeedRewrite </b>exists when <b>pmlogger_daily</b>
       starts then this is treated the same as specifying <b>-R </b>on the
       command line and <b>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmlogger/.NeedRewrite </b>will be
       removed once all the rewriting has been done.
