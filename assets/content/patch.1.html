       <b>patch </b>takes a patch file <i>patchfile</i> containing a difference
       listing produced by the <b>diff </b>program and applies those
       differences to one or more original files, producing patched
       versions.  Normally the patched versions are put in place of the
       originals.  Backups can be made; see the <b>-b </b>or <b>--backup </b>option.
       The names of the files to be patched are usually taken from the
       patch file, but if there's just one file to be patched it can be
       specified on the command line as <i>originalfile</i>.

       Upon startup, patch attempts to determine the type of the diff
       listing, unless overruled by a <b>-c </b>(<b>--context</b>), <b>-e </b>(<b>--ed</b>), <b>-n</b>
       (<b>--normal</b>), or <b>-u </b>(<b>--unified</b>) option.  Context diffs (old-style,
       new-style, and unified) and normal diffs are applied by the <b>patch</b>
       program itself, while <b>ed </b>diffs are simply fed to the <b>ed</b>(1) editor
       via a pipe.

       <b>patch </b>tries to skip any leading garbage, apply the diff, and then
       skip any trailing garbage.  Thus you could feed an article or
       message containing a diff listing to <b>patch</b>, and it should work.
       If the entire diff is indented by a consistent amount, if lines
       end in CRLF, or if a diff is encapsulated one or more times by
       prepending "<b>- </b>" to lines starting with "<b>-</b>" as specified by
       Internet RFC 934, this is taken into account.  After removing
       indenting or encapsulation, lines beginning with <b># </b>are ignored,
       as they are considered to be comments.

       With context diffs, and to a lesser extent with normal diffs,
       <b>patch </b>can detect when the line numbers mentioned in the patch are
       incorrect, and attempts to find the correct place to apply each
       hunk of the patch.  As a first guess, it takes the line number
       mentioned for the hunk, plus or minus any offset used in applying
       the previous hunk.  If that is not the correct place, <b>patch </b>scans
       both forwards and backwards for a set of lines matching the
       context given in the hunk.  First <b>patch </b>looks for a place where
       all lines of the context match.  If no such place is found, and
       it's a context diff, and the maximum fuzz factor is set to 1 or
       more, then another scan takes place ignoring the first and last
       line of context.  If that fails, and the maximum fuzz factor is
       set to 2 or more, the first two and last two lines of context are
       ignored, and another scan is made.  (The default maximum fuzz
       factor is 2.)

       Hunks with less prefix context than suffix context (after
       applying fuzz) must apply at the start of the file if their first
       line number is 1.  Hunks with more prefix context than suffix
       context (after applying fuzz) must apply at the end of the file.

       If <b>patch </b>cannot find a place to install that hunk of the patch,
       it puts the hunk out to a reject file, which normally is the name
       of the output file plus a <b>.rej </b>suffix, or <b># </b>if <b>.rej </b>would
       generate a file name that is too long (if even appending the
       single character <b># </b>makes the file name too long, then <b># </b>replaces
       the file name's last character).

       The rejected hunk comes out in unified or context diff format.
       If the input was a normal diff, many of the contexts are simply
       null.  The line numbers on the hunks in the reject file may be
       different than in the patch file: they reflect the approximate
       location patch thinks the failed hunks belong in the new file
       rather than the old one.

       As each hunk is completed, you are told if the hunk failed, and
       if so which line (in the new file) <b>patch </b>thought the hunk should
       go on.  If the hunk is installed at a different line from the
       line number specified in the diff, you are told the offset.  A
       single large offset <i>may</i> indicate that a hunk was installed in the
       wrong place.  You are also told if a fuzz factor was used to make
       the match, in which case you should also be slightly suspicious.
       If the <b>--verbose </b>option is given, you are also told about hunks
       that match exactly.

       If no original file <i>origfile</i> is specified on the command line,
       <b>patch </b>tries to figure out from the leading garbage what the name
       of the file to edit is, using the following rules.

       First, <b>patch </b>takes an ordered list of candidate file names as
       follows:

        <b>• </b>If the header is that of a context diff, <b>patch </b>takes the old
          and new file names in the header.  A name is ignored if it
          does not have enough slashes to satisfy the <b>-p</b><i>num</i> or
          <b>--strip=</b><i>num</i> option.  The name <b>/dev/null </b>is also ignored.

        <b>• </b>If there is an <b>Index: </b>line in the leading garbage and if
          either the old and new names are both absent or if <b>patch </b>is
          conforming to POSIX, <b>patch </b>takes the name in the <b>Index: </b>line.

        <b>• </b>For the purpose of the following rules, the candidate file
          names are considered to be in the order (old, new, index),
          regardless of the order that they appear in the header.

       Then <b>patch </b>selects a file name from the candidate list as
       follows:

        <b>• </b>If some of the named files exist, <b>patch </b>selects the first name
          if conforming to POSIX, and the best name otherwise.

        <b>• </b>If <b>patch </b>is not ignoring RCS, ClearCase, Perforce, and SCCS
          (see the <b>-g </b><i>num</i> or <b>--get=</b><i>num</i> option), and no named files exist
          but an RCS, ClearCase, Perforce, or SCCS master is found,
          <b>patch </b>selects the first named file with an RCS, ClearCase,
          Perforce, or SCCS master.

        <b>• </b>If no named files exist, no RCS, ClearCase, Perforce, or SCCS
          master was found, some names are given, <b>patch </b>is not
          conforming to POSIX, and the patch appears to create a file,
          <b>patch </b>selects the best name requiring the creation of the
          fewest directories.

        <b>• </b>If no file name results from the above heuristics, you are
          asked for the name of the file to patch, and <b>patch </b>selects
          that name.

       To determine the <i>best</i> of a nonempty list of file names, <b>patch</b>
       first takes all the names with the fewest path name components;
       of those, it then takes all the names with the shortest basename;
       of those, it then takes all the shortest names; finally, it takes
       the first remaining name.

       Additionally, if the leading garbage contains a <b>Prereq: </b>line,
       <b>patch </b>takes the first word from the prerequisites line (normally
       a version number) and checks the original file to see if that
       word can be found.  If not, <b>patch </b>asks for confirmation before
       proceeding.

       The upshot of all this is that you should be able to say, while
       in a news interface, something like the following:

              <b>| patch -d /usr/src/local/blurfl</b>

       and patch a file in the <b>blurfl </b>directory directly from the
       article containing the patch.

       If the patch file contains more than one patch, <b>patch </b>tries to
       apply each of them as if they came from separate patch files.
       This means, among other things, that it is assumed that the name
       of the file to patch must be determined for each diff listing,
       and that the garbage before each diff listing contains
       interesting things such as file names and revision level, as
       mentioned previously.
