       <i>Cron</i> is started from <i>/etc/rc.d/init.d</i> or <i>/etc/init.d</i> when
       classical sysvinit scripts are used. In case systemd is enabled,
       then unit file is installed into
       <i>/lib/systemd/system/crond.service</i> and daemon is started by
       <i>systemctl start crond.service</i> command. It returns immediately,
       thus, there is no need to need to start it with the '&amp;'
       parameter.

       <i>Cron</i> searches <i>/var/spool/cron</i> for crontab files which are named
       after accounts in <i>/etc/passwd;</i> The found crontabs are loaded into
       the memory.  <i>Cron</i> also searches for <i>/etc/anacrontab</i> and any files
       in the <i>/etc/cron.d</i> directory, which have a different format (see
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/crontab.5.html">crontab(5)</a>).  <i>Cron</i> examines all stored crontabs and checks each
       job to see if it needs to be run in the current minute.  When
       executing commands, any output is mailed to the owner of the
       crontab (or to the user specified in the <i>MAILTO</i> environment
       variable in the crontab, if such exists).  Any job output can
       also be sent to syslog by using the <b>-s </b>option.

       There are two ways how changes in crontables are checked.  The
       first method is checking the modtime of a file.  The second
       method is using the inotify support.  Using of inotify is logged
       in the <i>/var/log/cron</i> log after the daemon is started.  The
       inotify support checks for changes in all crontables and accesses
       the hard disk only when a change is detected.

       When using the modtime option, <i>Cron</i> checks its crontables'
       modtimes every minute to check for any changes and reloads the
       crontables which have changed.  There is no need to restart <i>Cron</i>
       after some of the crontables were modified.  The modtime option
       is also used when inotify can not be initialized.

       <i>Cron</i> checks these files and directories:

       <i>/etc/crontab</i>
              system crontab.  Nowadays the file is empty by default.
              Originally it was usually used to run daily, weekly,
              monthly jobs.  By default these jobs are now run through
              anacron which reads <i>/etc/anacrontab</i> configuration file.
              See <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/anacrontab.5.html">anacrontab(5)</a> for more details.

       <i>/etc/cron.d/</i>
              directory that contains system cronjobs stored for
              different users.

       <i>/var/spool/cron</i>
              directory that contains user crontables created by the
              <i>crontab</i> command.

       Note that the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/crontab.1.html">crontab(1)</a> command updates the modtime of the spool
       directory whenever it changes a crontab.

   <b>Daylight Saving Time and other time changes</b>
       Local time changes of less than three hours, such as those caused
       by the Daylight Saving Time changes, are handled in a special
       way.  This only applies to jobs that run at a specific time and
       jobs that run with a granularity greater than one hour.  Jobs
       that run more frequently are scheduled normally.

       If time was adjusted one hour forward, those jobs that would have
       run in the interval that has been skipped will be run
       immediately.  Conversely, if time was adjusted backward, running
       the same job twice is avoided.

       Time changes of more than 3 hours are considered to be
       corrections to the clock or the timezone, and the new time is
       used immediately.

       It is possible to use different time zones for crontables.  See
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/crontab.5.html">crontab(5)</a> for more information.

   <b>PAM Access Control</b>
       <i>Cron</i> supports access control with PAM if the system has PAM
       installed.  For more information, see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/pam.8.html">pam(8)</a>.  A PAM
       configuration file for <i>crond</i> is installed in <i>/etc/pam.d/crond</i>.
       The daemon loads the PAM environment from the pam_env module.
       This can be overridden by defining specific settings in the
       appropriate crontab file.
