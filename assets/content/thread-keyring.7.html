       The thread keyring is a keyring used to anchor keys on behalf of
       a process.  It is created only when a thread requests it.  The
       thread keyring has the name (description) <i>_tid</i>.

       A special serial number value, <b>KEY_SPEC_THREAD_KEYRING</b>, is
       defined that can be used in lieu of the actual serial number of
       the calling thread's thread keyring.

       From the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/keyctl.1.html">keyctl(1)</a> utility, '<b>@t</b>' can be used instead of a numeric
       key ID in much the same way, but as <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/keyctl.1.html">keyctl(1)</a> is a program run
       after forking, this is of no utility.

       Thread keyrings are not inherited across <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/clone.2.html">clone(2)</a> and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fork.2.html">fork(2)</a> and
       are cleared by <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>.  A thread keyring is destroyed when the
       thread that refers to it terminates.

       Initially, a thread does not have a thread keyring.  If a thread
       doesn't have a thread keyring when it is accessed, then it will
       be created if it is to be modified; otherwise the operation fails
       with the error <b>ENOKEY</b>.
