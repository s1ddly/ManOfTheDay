       <b>dh_md5sums </b>is a debhelper program that is responsible for
       generating a <i>DEBIAN/md5sums</i> file, which lists the md5sums of each
       file in the package.  These files are used by <b>dpkg --verify </b>or
       the <b>debsums</b>(1) program.

       All files in <i>DEBIAN/</i> are omitted from the <i>md5sums</i> file, as are
       all conffiles (unless you use the <b>--include-conffiles </b>switch).

       The md5sums file is installed with proper permissions and
       ownerships.
