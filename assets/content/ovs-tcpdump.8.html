       <b>ovs-tcpdump </b>creates switch mirror ports in the <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>
       daemon and executes <b>tcpdump </b>to listen against those ports. When
       the <b>tcpdump </b>instance exits, it then cleans up the mirror port it
       created.

       <b>ovs-tcpdump </b>will not allow multiple mirrors for the same port. It
       has some logic to parse the current configuration and prevent
       duplicate mirrors.

       The <b>-i </b>option may not appear multiple times.

       It is important to note that under <b>Linux </b>based kernels, tap
       devices do not receive packets unless the specific tuntap device
       has been opened by an application. This requires <b>CAP_NET_ADMIN</b>
       privileges, so the <b>ovs-tcpdump </b>command must be run as a user with
       such permissions (this is usually a super-user).
