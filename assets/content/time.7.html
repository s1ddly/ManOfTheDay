   <b>Real time and process time</b>
       <i>Real time</i> is defined as time measured from some fixed point,
       either from a standard point in the past (see the description of
       the Epoch and calendar time below), or from some point (e.g., the
       start) in the life of a process (<i>elapsed time</i>).

       <i>Process time</i> is defined as the amount of CPU time used by a
       process.  This is sometimes divided into <i>user</i> and <i>system</i>
       components.  User CPU time is the time spent executing code in
       user mode.  System CPU time is the time spent by the kernel
       executing in system mode on behalf of the process (e.g.,
       executing system calls).  The <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/time.1.html">time(1)</a> command can be used to
       determine the amount of CPU time consumed during the execution of
       a program.  A program can determine the amount of CPU time it has
       consumed using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/times.2.html">times(2)</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getrusage.2.html">getrusage(2)</a>, or <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/clock.3.html">clock(3)</a>.

   <b>The hardware clock</b>
       Most computers have a (battery-powered) hardware clock which the
       kernel reads at boot time in order to initialize the software
       clock.  For further details, see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man4/rtc.4.html">rtc(4)</a> and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/hwclock.8.html">hwclock(8)</a>.

   <b>The software clock, HZ, and jiffies</b>
       The accuracy of various system calls that set timeouts, (e.g.,
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/select.2.html">select(2)</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sigtimedwait.2.html">sigtimedwait(2)</a>) and measure CPU time (e.g.,
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getrusage.2.html">getrusage(2)</a>) is limited by the resolution of the <i>software clock</i>,
       a clock maintained by the kernel which measures time in <i>jiffies</i>.
       The size of a jiffy is determined by the value of the kernel
       constant <i>HZ</i>.

       The value of <i>HZ</i> varies across kernel versions and hardware
       platforms.  On i386 the situation is as follows: on kernels up to
       and including 2.4.x, HZ was 100, giving a jiffy value of 0.01
       seconds; starting with 2.6.0, HZ was raised to 1000, giving a
       jiffy of 0.001 seconds.  Since kernel 2.6.13, the HZ value is a
       kernel configuration parameter and can be 100, 250 (the default)
       or 1000, yielding a jiffies value of, respectively, 0.01, 0.004,
       or 0.001 seconds.  Since kernel 2.6.20, a further frequency is
       available: 300, a number that divides evenly for the common video
       frame rates (PAL, 25 HZ; NTSC, 30 HZ).

       The <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/times.2.html">times(2)</a> system call is a special case.  It reports times
       with a granularity defined by the kernel constant <i>USER_HZ</i>.  User-
       space applications can determine the value of this constant using
       <i>sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)</i>.

   <b>System and process clocks; time namespaces</b>
       The kernel supports a range of clocks that measure various kinds
       of elapsed and virtual (i.e., consumed CPU) time.  These clocks
       are described in <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/clock_gettime.2.html">clock_gettime(2)</a>.  A few of the clocks are
       settable using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/clock_settime.2.html">clock_settime(2)</a>.  The values of certain clocks
       are virtualized by time namespaces; see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/time_namespaces.7.html">time_namespaces(7)</a>.

   <b>High-resolution timers</b>
       Before Linux 2.6.21, the accuracy of timer and sleep system calls
       (see below) was also limited by the size of the jiffy.

       Since Linux 2.6.21, Linux supports high-resolution timers (HRTs),
       optionally configurable via <b>CONFIG_HIGH_RES_TIMERS</b>.  On a system
       that supports HRTs, the accuracy of sleep and timer system calls
       is no longer constrained by the jiffy, but instead can be as
       accurate as the hardware allows (microsecond accuracy is typical
       of modern hardware).  You can determine whether high-resolution
       timers are supported by checking the resolution returned by a
       call to <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/clock_getres.2.html">clock_getres(2)</a> or looking at the "resolution" entries in
       <i>/proc/timer_list</i>.

       HRTs are not supported on all hardware architectures.  (Support
       is provided on x86, arm, and powerpc, among others.)

   <b>The Epoch</b>
       UNIX systems represent time in seconds since the <i>Epoch</i>,
       1970-01-01 00:00:00 +0000 (UTC).

       A program can determine the <i>calendar time</i> via the
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/clock_gettime.2.html">clock_gettime(2)</a> <b>CLOCK_REALTIME </b>clock, which returns time (in
       seconds and nanoseconds) that have elapsed since the Epoch;
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/time.2.html">time(2)</a> provides similar information, but only with accuracy to
       the nearest second.  The system time can be changed using
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/clock_settime.2.html">clock_settime(2)</a>.

   <b>Broken-down time</b>
       Certain library functions use a structure of type <i>tm</i> to represent
       <i>broken-down time</i>, which stores time value separated out into
       distinct components (year, month, day, hour, minute, second,
       etc.).  This structure is described in <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/ctime.3.html">ctime(3)</a>, which also
       describes functions that convert between calendar time and
       broken-down time.  Functions for converting between broken-down
       time and printable string representations of the time are
       described in <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/ctime.3.html">ctime(3)</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/strftime.3.html">strftime(3)</a>, and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/strptime.3.html">strptime(3)</a>.

   <b>Sleeping and setting timers</b>
       Various system calls and functions allow a program to sleep
       (suspend execution) for a specified period of time; see
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/nanosleep.2.html">nanosleep(2)</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/clock_nanosleep.2.html">clock_nanosleep(2)</a>, and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/sleep.3.html">sleep(3)</a>.

       Various system calls allow a process to set a timer that expires
       at some point in the future, and optionally at repeated
       intervals; see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/alarm.2.html">alarm(2)</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getitimer.2.html">getitimer(2)</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/timerfd_create.2.html">timerfd_create(2)</a>, and
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/timer_create.2.html">timer_create(2)</a>.

   <b>Timer slack</b>
       Since Linux 2.6.28, it is possible to control the "timer slack"
       value for a thread.  The timer slack is the length of time by
       which the kernel may delay the wake-up of certain system calls
       that block with a timeout.  Permitting this delay allows the
       kernel to coalesce wake-up events, thus possibly reducing the
       number of system wake-ups and saving power.  For more details,
       see the description of <b>PR_SET_TIMERSLACK </b>in <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/prctl.2.html">prctl(2)</a>.
