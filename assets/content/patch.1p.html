<pre>
       The <i>patch</i> utility shall read a source (patch) file containing any
       of four forms of difference (diff) listings produced by the <i>diff</i>
       utility (normal, copied context, unified context, or in the style
       of <i>ed</i>) and apply those differences to a file. By default, <i>patch</i>
       shall read from the standard input.

       The <i>patch</i> utility shall attempt to determine the type of the <i>diff</i>
       listing, unless overruled by a <b>-c</b>, <b>-e</b>, <b>-n</b>, or <b>-u </b>option.

       If the patch file contains more than one patch, <i>patch</i> shall
       attempt to apply each of them as if they came from separate patch
       files. (In this case, the application shall ensure that the name
       of the patch file is determinable for each <i>diff</i> listing.)
