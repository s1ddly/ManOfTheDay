       IPC namespaces isolate certain IPC resources, namely, System V
       IPC objects (see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/sysvipc.7.html">sysvipc(7)</a>) and (since Linux 2.6.30) POSIX
       message queues (see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/mq_overview.7.html">mq_overview(7)</a>).  The common characteristic
       of these IPC mechanisms is that IPC objects are identified by
       mechanisms other than filesystem pathnames.

       Each IPC namespace has its own set of System V IPC identifiers
       and its own POSIX message queue filesystem.  Objects created in
       an IPC namespace are visible to all other processes that are
       members of that namespace, but are not visible to processes in
       other IPC namespaces.

       The following <i>/proc</i> interfaces are distinct in each IPC
       namespace:

       *  The POSIX message queue interfaces in <i>/proc/sys/fs/mqueue</i>.

       *  The System V IPC interfaces in <i>/proc/sys/kernel</i>, namely:
          <i>msgmax</i>, <i>msgmnb</i>, <i>msgmni</i>, <i>sem</i>, <i>shmall</i>, <i>shmmax</i>, <i>shmmni</i>, and
          <i>shm_rmid_forced</i>.

       *  The System V IPC interfaces in <i>/proc/sysvipc</i>.

       When an IPC namespace is destroyed (i.e., when the last process
       that is a member of the namespace terminates), all IPC objects in
       the namespace are automatically destroyed.

       Use of IPC namespaces requires a kernel that is configured with
       the <b>CONFIG_IPC_NS </b>option.
