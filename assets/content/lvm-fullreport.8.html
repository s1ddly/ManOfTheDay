       lvm fullreport produces formatted output about PVs, PV segments,
       VGs, LVs and LV segments. The information is all gathered
       together for each VG (under a per-VG lock) so it is consistent.
       Information gathered from separate calls to <b>vgs</b>, <b>pvs</b>, and <b>lvs </b>can
       be inconsistent if information changes between commands.
