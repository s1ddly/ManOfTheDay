       <b>dpkg-gensymbols </b>scans a temporary build tree (debian/tmp by
       default) looking for libraries and generates a <i>symbols</i> file
       describing them. This file, if non-empty, is then installed in
       the DEBIAN subdirectory of the build tree so that it ends up
       included in the control information of the package.

       When generating those files, it uses as input some symbols files
       provided by the maintainer. It looks for the following files (and
       uses the first that is found):

       •   debian/<i>package</i>.symbols.<i>arch</i>

       •   debian/symbols.<i>arch</i>

       •   debian/<i>package</i>.symbols

       •   debian/symbols

       The main interest of those files is to provide the minimal
       version associated to each symbol provided by the libraries.
       Usually it corresponds to the first version of that package that
       provided the symbol, but it can be manually incremented by the
       maintainer if the ABI of the symbol is extended without breaking
       backwards compatibility. It's the responsibility of the
       maintainer to keep those files up-to-date and accurate, but
       <b>dpkg-gensymbols </b>helps with that.

       When the generated symbols files differ from the maintainer
       supplied one, <b>dpkg-gensymbols </b>will print a diff between the two
       versions.  Furthermore if the difference is too significant, it
       will even fail (you can customize how much difference you can
       tolerate, see the <b>-c </b>option).
