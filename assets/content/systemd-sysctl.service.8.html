       systemd-sysctl.service is an early boot service that configures
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/sysctl.8.html">sysctl(8)</a> kernel parameters by invoking
       <b>/usr/lib/systemd/systemd-sysctl</b>.

       When invoked with no arguments, <b>/usr/lib/systemd/systemd-sysctl</b>
       applies all directives from configuration files listed in
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/sysctl.d.5.html">sysctl.d(5)</a>. If one or more filenames are passed on the command
       line, only the directives in these files are applied.

       In addition, <b>--prefix= </b>option may be used to limit which sysctl
       settings are applied.

       See <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/sysctl.d.5.html">sysctl.d(5)</a> for information about the configuration of sysctl
       settings. After sysctl configuration is changed on disk, it must
       be written to the files in /proc/sys/ before it takes effect. It
       is possible to update specific settings, or simply to reload all
       configuration, see Examples below.
