       The C++ and Java languages provide function overloading, which
       means that you can write many functions with the same name,
       providing that each function takes parameters of different types.
       In order to be able to distinguish these similarly named
       functions C++ and Java encode them into a low-level assembler
       name which uniquely identifies each different version.  This
       process is known as <i>mangling</i>. The <b>c++filt </b>[1] program does the
       inverse mapping: it decodes (<i>demangles</i>) low-level names into
       user-level names so that they can be read.

       Every alphanumeric word (consisting of letters, digits,
       underscores, dollars, or periods) seen in the input is a
       potential mangled name.  If the name decodes into a C++ name, the
       C++ name replaces the low-level name in the output, otherwise the
       original word is output.  In this way you can pass an entire
       assembler source file, containing mangled names, through <b>c++filt</b>
       and see the same source file containing demangled names.

       You can also use <b>c++filt </b>to decipher individual symbols by
       passing them on the command line:

               c++filt &lt;symbol&gt;

       If no <i>symbol</i> arguments are given, <b>c++filt </b>reads symbol names from
       the standard input instead.  All the results are printed on the
       standard output.  The difference between reading names from the
       command line versus reading names from the standard input is that
       command-line arguments are expected to be just mangled names and
       no checking is performed to separate them from surrounding text.
       Thus for example:

               c++filt -n _Z1fv

       will work and demangle the name to "f()" whereas:

               c++filt -n _Z1fv,

       will not work.  (Note the extra comma at the end of the mangled
       name which makes it invalid).  This command however will work:

               echo _Z1fv, | c++filt -n

       and will display "f(),", i.e., the demangled name followed by a
       trailing comma.  This behaviour is because when the names are
       read from the standard input it is expected that they might be
       part of an assembler source file where there might be extra,
       extraneous characters trailing after a mangled name.  For
       example:

                   .type   _Z1fv, @function
