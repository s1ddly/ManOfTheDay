       systemd-timesyncd is a system service that may be used to
       synchronize the local system clock with a remote Network Time
       Protocol (NTP) server. It also saves the local time to disk every
       time the clock has been synchronized and uses this to possibly
       advance the system realtime clock on subsequent reboots to ensure
       it (roughly) monotonically advances even if the system lacks a
       battery-buffered RTC chip.

       The systemd-timesyncd service implements SNTP only. This
       minimalistic service will step the system clock for large offsets
       or slowly adjust it for smaller deltas. Complex use cases that
       require full NTP support (and where SNTP is not sufficient) are
       not covered by systemd-timesyncd.

       The NTP servers contacted are determined from the global settings
       in <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/timesyncd.conf.5.html">timesyncd.conf(5)</a>, the per-link static settings in .network
       files, and the per-link dynamic settings received over DHCP. See
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/systemd.network.5.html">systemd.network(5)</a> for further details.

       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/timedatectl.1.html">timedatectl(1)</a>'s <b>set-ntp </b>command may be used to enable and start,
       or disable and stop this service.

       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/timedatectl.1.html">timedatectl(1)</a>'s <b>timesync-status </b>or <b>show-timesync </b>command can be
       used to show the current status of this service.

       systemd-timesyncd initialization delays the start of units that
       are ordered after time-set.target (see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/systemd.special.7.html">systemd.special(7)</a> for
       details) until the local time has been updated from
       /var/lib/systemd/timesync/clock (see below) in order to make it
       roughly monotonic. It does not delay other units until
       synchronization with an accurate reference time sources has been
       reached. Use <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/systemd-time-wait-sync.service.8.html">systemd-time-wait-sync.service(8)</a> to achieve that,
       which will delay start of units that are ordered after
       time-sync.target until synchronization to an accurate reference
       clock is reached.
