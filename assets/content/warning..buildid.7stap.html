       Because systemtap's script translation / execution stages may be
       executed at different times and places, it is sometimes necessary
       to verify certain invariants.  One such invariant is that if a
       script was informed by translate-time analysis of executables,
       then those same executables need to be used at run time.  This
       checking is done based upon the build-id, a binary hash that
       modern (post-2007) compilers/toolchains add as an <i>NT_GNU_BUILD_ID</i>
       ELF note to object files and executables.  Use the <i>readelf -n</i>
       command to examine the build-ids of binaries, if you are
       interested.

       Only scripts are sensitive to executables' build-ids: generally
       those that perform deep analysis of the binaries or their
       debuginfo.  For example, scripts that place <i>.function</i> or
       <i>.statement</i> probes, or use stack backtrace-related tapset
       functions may be sensitive.  Other scripts that rely only on
       <i>process.mark</i> or <i>kernel.trace</i> probes do not require debuginfo.
       See the DWARF DEBUGINFO section in the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/stapprobes.3stap.html">stapprobes(3stap)</a> man
       page.

       During translation, systemtap saves a copy of the relevant files'
       build-ids within the compiled modules.  At run-time, the modules
       compare the saved ones to the actual run-time build-ids in
       memory.  The warning message indicates that they did not match,
       so the module will decline placing a probe that was computed
       based upon obsolete data.  This is important for safety, as
       placing them at an inappropriate address could crash the
       programs.  However, this is not necessarily a fatal error, since
       probes unrelated to the mismatching binaries may operate.

       A build-id mismatch could be caused by a few different
       situations.  The main one is where the executable versions or
       architecture were different between the systemtap translation and
       execution times/places.  For example, one may run a stap-server
       on a slightly different version of the OS distribution.  Someone
       may have rebuilt a new kernel image, but preserved the previous
       version numbers.  The kernel running on the workstation may be
       slightly different from the version being targeted - perhaps due
       to a pending kernel upgrade leaving different files on disk
       versus running in memory.  If your OS distribution uses separate
       debuginfo packages, the split <i>.debug</i> files may not exactly match
       the main binaries.

       To disable build-id verification warnings, if one is confident
       that they are an artefact of build accidents rather than a real
       mismatch, one might try the <i>-DSTP_NO_BUILDID_CHECK</i> option.
