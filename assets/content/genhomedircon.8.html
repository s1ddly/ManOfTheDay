       <b>genhomedircon </b>is a script that executes <b>semodule </b>to rebuild the
       currently active SELinux policy (without reloading it) and to
       create the labels for each user home directory based on directory
       paths returned by calls to getpwent().

       The latter functionality depends on the "usepasswd" parameter
       being set to "true" (default) in /etc/selinux/semanage.conf.

       This script is usually executed by <b>semanage </b>although this default
       behavior can be optionally modified by setting to "true" the
       "disable-genhomedircon" in /etc/selinux/semanage.conf.

       Directories can be excluded from the list of home directories by
       the setting "ignoredirs" in /etc/selinux/semanage.conf.
