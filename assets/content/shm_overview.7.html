       The POSIX shared memory API allows processes to communicate
       information by sharing a region of memory.

       The interfaces employed in the API are:

       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/shm_open.3.html">shm_open(3)</a>
              Create and open a new object, or open an existing object.
              This is analogous to <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/open.2.html">open(2)</a>.  The call returns a file
              descriptor for use by the other interfaces listed below.

       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ftruncate.2.html">ftruncate(2)</a>
              Set the size of the shared memory object.  (A newly
              created shared memory object has a length of zero.)

       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html">mmap(2)</a>
              Map the shared memory object into the virtual address
              space of the calling process.

       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/munmap.2.html">munmap(2)</a>
              Unmap the shared memory object from the virtual address
              space of the calling process.

       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/shm_unlink.3.html">shm_unlink(3)</a>
              Remove a shared memory object name.

       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/close.2.html">close(2)</a>
              Close the file descriptor allocated by <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/shm_open.3.html">shm_open(3)</a> when it
              is no longer needed.

       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fstat.2.html">fstat(2)</a>
              Obtain a <i>stat</i> structure that describes the shared memory
              object.  Among the information returned by this call are
              the object's size (<i>st_size</i>), permissions (<i>st_mode</i>), owner
              (<i>st_uid</i>), and group (<i>st_gid</i>).

       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fchown.2.html">fchown(2)</a>
              To change the ownership of a shared memory object.

       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fchmod.2.html">fchmod(2)</a>
              To change the permissions of a shared memory object.

   <b>Versions</b>
       POSIX shared memory is supported since Linux 2.4 and glibc 2.2.

   <b>Persistence</b>
       POSIX shared memory objects have kernel persistence: a shared
       memory object will exist until the system is shut down, or until
       all processes have unmapped the object and it has been deleted
       with <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/shm_unlink.3.html">shm_unlink(3)</a>

   <b>Linking</b>
       Programs using the POSIX shared memory API must be compiled with
       <i>cc -lrt</i> to link against the real-time library, <i>librt</i>.

   <b>Accessing shared memory objects via the filesystem</b>
       On Linux, shared memory objects are created in a (<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/tmpfs.5.html">tmpfs(5)</a>)
       virtual filesystem, normally mounted under <i>/dev/shm</i>.  Since
       kernel 2.6.19, Linux supports the use of access control lists
       (ACLs) to control the permissions of objects in the virtual
       filesystem.
