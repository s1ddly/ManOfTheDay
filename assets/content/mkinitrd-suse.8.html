       <b>mkinitrd </b>creates an initramfs image &lt;initrd-image&gt; for the kernel
       with version &lt;kernel-version&gt; by calling <b>dracut</b>.

           <b>Important</b>
           This version of mkinitrd is provided for compatibility with
           older versions of mkinitrd. If a more fine grained control
           over the resulting image is needed, <b>dracut </b>should be called
           directly.
