       SKB Priority Queue is a queueing discipline intended to
       prioritize the most important packets during a denial-of-service
       ( <b>DoS </b>) attack. The priority of a packet is given by
       <b>skb-&gt;priority </b>, where a higher value places the packet closer to
       the exit of the queue. When the queue is full, the lowest
       priority packet in the queue is dropped to make room for the
       packet to be added if it has higher priority. If the packet to be
       added has lower priority than all packets in the queue, it is
       dropped.

       Without SKB priority queue, queue length limits must be imposed
       on individual sub-queues, and there is no straightforward way to
       enforce a global queue length limit across all priorities.
       SKBprio queue enforces a global queue length limit while not
       restricting the lengths of individual sub-queues.

       While SKB Priority Queue is agnostic to how <b>skb-&gt;priority </b>is
       assigned. A typical use case is to copy the 6-bit DS field of
       IPv4 and IPv6 packets using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/tc-skbedit.8.html">tc-skbedit(8)</a>.  If <b>skb-&gt;priority </b>is
       greater or equal to 64, the priority is assumed to be 63.
       Priorities less than 64 are taken at face value.

       SKB Priority Queue enables routers to locally decide which
       packets to drop under a DoS attack.  Priorities should be
       assigned to packets such that the higher the priority, the more
       expected behavior a source shows.  So sources have an incentive
       to play by the rules.
