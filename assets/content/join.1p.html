<pre>
       The <i>join</i> utility shall perform an equality join on the files
       <i>file1</i> and <i>file2</i>.  The joined files shall be written to the
       standard output.

       The join field is a field in each file on which the files are
       compared. The <i>join</i> utility shall write one line in the output for
       each pair of lines in <i>file1</i> and <i>file2</i> that have join fields that
       collate equally. The output line by default shall consist of the
       join field, then the remaining fields from <i>file1</i>, then the
       remaining fields from <i>file2</i>.  This format can be changed by using
       the <b>-o </b>option (see below). The <b>-a </b>option can be used to add
       unmatched lines to the output. The <b>-v </b>option can be used to
       output only unmatched lines.

       The files <i>file1</i> and <i>file2</i> shall be ordered in the collating
       sequence of <i>sort</i> <b>-b </b>on the fields on which they shall be joined,
       by default the first in each line. All selected output shall be
       written in the same collating sequence.

       The default input field separators shall be &lt;blank&gt; characters.
       In this case, multiple separators shall count as one field
       separator, and leading separators shall be ignored. The default
       output field separator shall be a &lt;space&gt;.

       The field separator and collating sequence can be changed by
       using the <b>-t </b>option (see below).

       If the same key appears more than once in either file, all
       combinations of the set of remaining fields in <i>file1</i> and the set
       of remaining fields in <i>file2</i> are output in the order of the lines
       encountered.

       If the input files are not in the appropriate collating sequence,
       the results are unspecified.
