<pre>
       The <i>lex</i> utility shall generate C programs to be used in lexical
       processing of character input, and that can be used as an
       interface to <i>yacc</i>.  The C programs shall be generated from <i>lex</i>
       source code and conform to the ISO C standard, without depending
       on any undefined, unspecified, or implementation-defined
       behavior, except in cases where the code is copied directly from
       the supplied source, or in cases that are documented by the
       implementation. Usually, the <i>lex</i> utility shall write the program
       it generates to the file <b>lex.yy.c</b>; the state of this file is
       unspecified if <i>lex</i> exits with a non-zero exit status. See the
       EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section for a complete description of the
       <i>lex</i> input language.
