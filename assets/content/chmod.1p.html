       The <i>chmod</i> utility shall change any or all of the file mode bits
       of the file named by each <i>file</i> operand in the way specified by
       the <i>mode</i> operand.

       It is implementation-defined whether and how the <i>chmod</i> utility
       affects any alternate or additional file access control mechanism
       (see the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‚Äê2017, <i>Section 4.5</i>,
       <i>File Access Permissions</i>) being used for the specified file.

       Only a process whose effective user ID matches the user ID of the
       file, or a process with appropriate privileges, shall be
       permitted to change the file mode bits of a file.

       Upon successfully changing the file mode bits of a file, the
       <i>chmod</i> utility shall mark for update the last file status change
       timestamp of the file.
