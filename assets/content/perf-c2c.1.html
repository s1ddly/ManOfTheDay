       C2C stands for Cache To Cache.

       The perf c2c tool provides means for Shared Data C2C/HITM
       analysis. It allows you to track down the cacheline contentions.

       On x86, the tool is based on load latency and precise store
       facility events provided by Intel CPUs. On PowerPC, the tool uses
       random instruction sampling with thresholding feature.

       These events provide: - memory address of the access - type of
       the access (load and store details) - latency (in cycles) of the
       load access

       The c2c tool provide means to record this data and report back
       access details for cachelines with highest contention - highest
       number of HITM accesses.

       The basic workflow with this tool follows the standard
       record/report phase. User uses the record command to record
       events data and report command to display it.
