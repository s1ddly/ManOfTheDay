<pre>
       The <i>time</i> utility shall invoke the utility named by the <i>utility</i>
       operand with arguments supplied as the <i>argument</i> operands and
       write a message to standard error that lists timing statistics
       for the utility. The message shall include the following
       information:

        *  The elapsed (real) time between invocation of <i>utility</i> and its
           termination.

        *  The User CPU time, equivalent to the sum of the <i>tms_utime</i> and
           <i>tms_cutime</i> fields returned by the <i>times</i>() function defined in
           the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‚Äê2017 for the process
           in which <i>utility</i> is executed.

        *  The System CPU time, equivalent to the sum of the <i>tms_stime</i>
           and <i>tms_cstime</i> fields returned by the <i>times</i>() function for
           the process in which <i>utility</i> is executed.

       The precision of the timing shall be no less than the granularity
       defined for the size of the clock tick unit on the system, but
       the results shall be reported in terms of standard time units
       (for example, 0.02 seconds, 00:00:00.02, 1m33.75s, 365.21
       seconds), not numbers of clock ticks.

       When <i>time</i> is used as part of a pipeline, the times reported are
       unspecified, except when it is the sole command within a grouping
       command (see <i>Section 2.9.4.1</i>, <i>Grouping Commands</i>) in that
       pipeline. For example, the commands on the left are unspecified;
       those on the right report on utilities <b>a </b>and <b>c</b>, respectively:

           time a | b | c    { time a; } | b | c
           a | b | time c    a | b | (time c)
