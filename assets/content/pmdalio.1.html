       <b>pmdalio </b>is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
       exports metric values about the Linux I/O target subsystem, which
       provides for protocols like iSCSI, FCP, FCoE.  These allow
       storage available on one host to be exported and consumed by
       other hosts using industry standard protocols.

       This PMDA exports summary metrics which are performance value
       aggregations and configuration per LIO target instance.
       Additionally, it provides per LUN performance metrics including
       IOPS, and READ and WRITE throughput.

       The LIO configuration is maintained within the kernel's <b>configfs</b>
       virtual filesystem.  The <i>python-rtslib</i> module provides an
       interface to <b>configfs</b>, allowing tools like <b>pmdalio </b>to interact
       with the settings and metadata held in <b>configfs</b>.
