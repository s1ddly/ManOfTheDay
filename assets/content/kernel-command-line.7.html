       The kernel, the initial RAM disk (initrd) and basic userspace
       functionality may be configured at boot via kernel command line
       arguments. In addition, various systemd tools look at the EFI
       variable "SystemdOptions" (if available). Both sources are
       combined, but the kernel command line has higher priority. Please
       note that <i>the EFI variable is only used by systemd tools, and is</i>
       <i>ignored by the kernel and other user space tools</i>, so it is not a
       replacement for the kernel command line.

       For command line parameters understood by the kernel, please see
       <b>kernel-parameters.html</b><b></b>[1] and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/bootparam.7.html">bootparam(7)</a>.

       For command line parameters understood by the initial RAM disk,
       please see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/dracut.cmdline.7.html">dracut.cmdline(7)</a>, or the documentation of the
       specific initrd implementation of your installation.
