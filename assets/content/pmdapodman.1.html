       <b>podman</b>(1) is a utility for managing pods, containers and
       container images, following the container pod concept popularized
       by Kubernetes.  <b>pmdapodman </b>is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent
       (PMDA) which extracts performance metrics describing the state of
       containers and pods managed by podman.

       The <b>podman </b>PMDA exports metrics that measure information about
       individual containers and groups of containers, called pods.

       A brief description of the <b>pmdapodman </b>command line options
       follows:

       <b>-d   </b>It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics <i>domain</i>
            number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is,
            <i>domain</i> should be different for every PMDA on the one host,
            and the same <i>domain</i> number should be used for the same PMDA
            on all hosts.

       <b>-l   </b>Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
            <i>podman.log</i> is written in the current directory of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a>
            when <b>pmdapodman </b>is started, i.e.  <b>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd</b>.  If the
            log file cannot be created or is not writable, output is
            written to the standard error instead.
