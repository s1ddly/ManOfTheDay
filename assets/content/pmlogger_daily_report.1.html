       <b>pmlogger_daily_report </b>and the associated <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/systemd.1.html">systemd(1)</a> services
       write daily performance summary reports, much like those produced
       by <b>sadc</b>(1) and the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/sa2.8.html">sa2(8)</a> utility.

       All of the command line arguments are optional and intended to be
       self explanatory.  The service is not enabled by default.  If the
       service is enabled and no arguments are specified,
       <b>pmlogger_daily_report </b>will be run by <b>systemd </b>at 2am each morning
       and write a performance summary report named <b>sar</b><i>XX</i> (where <i>XX</i> is
       yesterdays day-of-the-month, wrapping to the previous month if
       today is the 1st).  The <i>outputfile</i> may be changed with the <b>-f</b>
       option.  The report will be written to the <i>$PCP_LOG_DIR/sa</i>
       directory by default, but this may be changed with the <b>-o </b>option
       to a different <i>directory</i>.

       Note that there are suffciently flexible command line options for
       <b>pmlogger_daily_report </b>to be used to read any <b>archivefile </b>and
       write the report to any output directory.

       If the <b>-a </b>option is not given, the default input <i>archivefile</i> is
       <i>$PCP_ARCHIVE_DIR/HOSTNAME/YYYYMMDD</i>, where <i>HOSTNAME</i> defaults to
       the local hostname (unless changed with the <b>-h </b>option) and
       <i>YYYYMMDD</i> is the base name of yesterdays merged archive, as
       produced by <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> and the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmlogger_daily.1.html">pmlogger_daily(1)</a> scripts.  If
       <i>archivefile</i> is a directory, then <b>pmlogger_daily_report </b>will use
       all PCP archives found in that directory to write the report
       (this is known as multi-archive mode, and may be considerably
       slower than specifying a single archive as the input).

       The reports themselves are created by the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmrep.1.html">pmrep(1)</a> utility using
       its default configuration file, see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/pmrep.conf.5.html">pmrep.conf(5)</a>.  The <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmrep.1.html">pmrep(1)</a>
       configuration entries used to write the reports is currently
       hardwired into the <b>pmlogger_daily_report </b>script.

       Finally, the input archives must contain sufficient metrics as
       needed by <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmrep.1.html">pmrep(1)</a> to write the report.  On platforms that
       support it, the <i>pcp-zeroconf</i> package configures PCP logging as
       required for this - hence <b>pmlogger_daily_report </b>should be used
       with the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> configuration that is set up by <b>pcp-</b>
       <b>zeroconf</b>.  As the name suggests, <b>pcp-zeroconf </b>requires no
       additional configuration after installation in order to capture
       the required archives needed by <b>pmlogger_daily_report</b>.
