       <b>systemd-creds </b>is a tool for listing, showing, encrypting and
       decrypting unit credentials. Credentials are limited-size binary
       or textual objects that may be passed to unit processes. They are
       primarily used for passing cryptographic keys (both public and
       private) or certificates, user account information or identity
       information from the host to services.

       Credentials are configured in unit files via the <i>LoadCredential=</i>,
       <i>SetCredential=</i>, <i>LoadCredentialEncrypted=</i> and
       <i>SetCredentialEncrypted=</i> settings, see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/systemd.exec.5.html">systemd.exec(5)</a> for
       details.
