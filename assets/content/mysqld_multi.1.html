<pre>
       <b>mysqld_multi </b>is designed to manage several <b>mysqld </b>processes that
       listen for connections on different Unix socket files and TCP/IP
       ports. It can start or stop servers, or report their current
       status.

       <b>mysqld_multi </b>searches for groups named [mysqld<i>N</i>] in my.cnf (or in
       the file named by the <b>--config-file </b>option).  <i>N</i> can be any
       positive integer. This number is referred to in the following
       discussion as the option group number, or <i>GNR</i>. Group numbers
       distinguish option groups from one another and are used as
       arguments to <b>mysqld_multi </b>to specify which servers you want to
       start, stop, or obtain a status report for. Options listed in
       these groups are the same that you would use in the [mysqld]
       group used for starting <b>mysqld</b>. However, when using multiple
       servers, it is necessary that each one use its own value for
       options such as the Unix socket file and TCP/IP port number.

       To invoke <b>mysqld_multi</b>, use the following syntax:

           shell&gt; <b>mysqld_multi [</b><i>options</i><b>] {start|stop|report} [</b><i>GNR</i><b>[,</b><i>GNR</i><b>] ...]</b>

       start, stop, and report indicate which operation to perform. You
       can perform the designated operation for a single server or
       multiple servers, depending on the <i>GNR</i> list that follows the
       option name. If there is no list, <b>mysqld_multi </b>performs the
       operation for all servers in the option file.

       Each <i>GNR</i> value represents an option group number or range of
       group numbers. The value should be the number at the end of the
       group name in the option file. For example, the <i>GNR</i> for a group
       named [mysqld17] is 17. To specify a range of numbers, separate
       the first and last numbers by a dash. The <i>GNR</i> value 10-13
       represents groups [mysqld10] through [mysqld13]. Multiple groups
       or group ranges can be specified on the command line, separated
       by commas. There must be no whitespace characters (spaces or
       tabs) in the <i>GNR</i> list; anything after a whitespace character is
       ignored.

       This command starts a single server using option group
       [mysqld17]:

           shell&gt; <b>mysqld_multi start 17</b>

       This command stops several servers, using option groups [mysqld8]
       and [mysqld10] through [mysqld13]:

           shell&gt; <b>mysqld_multi stop 8,10-13</b>

       For an example of how you might set up an option file, use this
       command:

           shell&gt; <b>mysqld_multi --example</b>

       <b>mysqld_multi </b>searches for option files as follows:

       •   With <b>--no-defaults</b>, no option files are read.

       •   With <b>--defaults-file=</b><i>file_name</i>, only the named file is read.

       •   Otherwise, option files in the standard list of locations are
           read, including any file named by the
           <b>--defaults-extra-file=</b><i>file_name</i> option, if one is given. (If
           the option is given multiple times, the last value is used.)

       Option files read are searched for [mysqld_multi] and [mysqld<i>N</i>]
       option groups. The [mysqld_multi] group can be used for options
       to <b>mysqld_multi </b>itself.  [mysqld<i>N</i>] groups can be used for options
       passed to specific <b>mysqld </b>instances.

       The [mysqld] or [mysqld_safe] groups can be used for common
       options read by all instances of <b>mysqld </b>or <b>mysqld_safe</b>. You can
       specify a <b>--defaults-file=</b><i>file_name</i> option to use a different
       configuration file for that instance, in which case the [mysqld]
       or [mysqld_safe] groups from that file will be used for that
       instance.

       <b>mysqld_multi </b>supports the following options.

       •   <b>--help</b>

           Display a help message and exit.

       •   <b>--example</b>

           Display a sample option file.

       •   <b>--log=</b><i>file_name</i>

           Specify the name of the log file. If the file exists, log
           output is appended to it.

       •   <b>--mysqladmin=</b><i>prog_name</i>

           The <b>mysqladmin </b>binary to be used to stop servers.

       •   <b>--mysqld=</b><i>prog_name</i>

           The <b>mysqld </b>binary to be used. Note that you can specify
           <b>mysqld_safe </b>as the value for this option also. If you use
           <b>mysqld_safe </b>to start the server, you can include the mysqld
           or ledir options in the corresponding [mysqld<i>N</i>] option group.
           These options indicate the name of the server that
           <b>mysqld_safe </b>should start and the path name of the directory
           where the server is located. (See the descriptions for these
           options in <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/mysqld_safe.1.html">mysqld_safe(1)</a>.) Example:

               [mysqld38]
               mysqld = mysqld-debug
               ledir  = /opt/local/mysql/libexec

       •   <b>--no-log</b>

           Print log information to stdout rather than to the log file.
           By default, output goes to the log file.

       •   <b>--password=</b><i>password</i>

           The password of the MariaDB account to use when invoking
           <b>mysqladmin</b>. Note that the password value is not optional for
           this option, unlike for other MariaDB programs.

       •   <b>--silent</b>

           Silent mode; disable warnings.

       •   <b>--tcp-ip</b>

           Connect to the MariaDB server(s) via the TCP/IP port instead
           of the UNIX socket. This affects stopping and reporting. If a
           socket file is missing, the server may still be running, but
           can be accessed only via the TCP/IP port. By default
           connecting is done via the UNIX socket. This option affects
           stop and report operations.

       •   <b>--user=</b><i>user_name</i>

           The user name of the MariaDB account to use when invoking
           <b>mysqladmin</b>.

       •   <b>--verbose</b>

           Be more verbose.

       •   <b>--version</b>

           Display version information and exit.

       •   <b>--wsrep-new-cluster</b>

           Bootstrap a cluster.

       Some notes about <b>mysqld_multi</b>:

       •   <b>Most important</b>: Before using <b>mysqld_multi </b>be sure that you
           understand the meanings of the options that are passed to the
           <b>mysqld </b>servers and <i>why</i> you would want to have separate <b>mysqld</b>
           processes. Beware of the dangers of using multiple <b>mysqld</b>
           servers with the same data directory. Use separate data
           directories, unless you <i>know</i> what you are doing. Starting
           multiple servers with the same data directory does <i>not</i> give
           you extra performance in a threaded system.

       •   <b>Important</b>: Make sure that the data directory for each server
           is fully accessible to the Unix account that the specific
           <b>mysqld </b>process is started as.  <i>Do not</i> use the Unix <i>root</i>
           account for this, unless you <i>know</i> what you are doing.

       •   Make sure that the MariaDB account used for stopping the
           <b>mysqld </b>servers (with the <b>mysqladmin </b>program) has the same
           user name and password for each server. Also, make sure that
           the account has the SHUTDOWN privilege. If the servers that
           you want to manage have different user names or passwords for
           the administrative accounts, you might want to create an
           account on each server that has the same user name and
           password. For example, you might set up a common multi_admin
           account by executing the following commands for each server:

               shell&gt; <b>mysql -u root -S /tmp/mysql.sock -p</b>
               Enter password:
               mysql&gt; <b>GRANT SHUTDOWN ON *.*</b>
                   -&gt; <b>TO ´multi_admin´@´localhost´ IDENTIFIED BY ´multipass´;</b>

           Change the connection parameters appropriately when
           connecting to each one. Note that the host name part of the
           account name must allow you to connect as multi_admin from
           the host where you want to run <b>mysqld_multi</b>.

       •   The Unix socket file and the TCP/IP port number must be
           different for every <b>mysqld</b>. (Alternatively, if the host has
           multiple network addresses, you can use <b>--bind-address </b>to
           cause different servers to listen to different interfaces.)

       •   The <b>--pid-file </b>option is very important if you are using
           <b>mysqld_safe </b>to start <b>mysqld </b>(for example,
           <b>--mysqld=mysqld_safe</b>) Every <b>mysqld </b>should have its own
           process ID file. The advantage of using <b>mysqld_safe </b>instead
           of <b>mysqld </b>is that <b>mysqld_safe </b>monitors its <b>mysqld </b>process and
           restarts it if the process terminates due to a signal sent
           using kill -9 or for other reasons, such as a segmentation
           fault. Please note that the <b>mysqld_safe </b>script might require
           that you start it from a certain place. This means that you
           might have to change location to a certain directory before
           running <b>mysqld_multi</b>. If you have problems starting, please
           see the <b>mysqld_safe </b>script. Check especially the lines:

               ----------------------------------------------------------------
               MY_PWD=`pwd`
               # Check if we are starting this relative (for the binary release)
               if test -d $MY_PWD/data/mysql -a \
                  -f ./share/mysql/english/errmsg.sys -a \
                  -x ./bin/mysqld
               ----------------------------------------------------------------

           The test performed by these lines should be successful, or
           you might encounter problems. See <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/mysqld_safe.1.html">mysqld_safe(1)</a>.

       •   You might want to use the <b>--user </b>option for <b>mysqld</b>, but to do
           this you need to run the <b>mysqld_multi </b>script as the Unix root
           user. Having the option in the option file doesn´t matter;
           you just get a warning if you are not the superuser and the
           <b>mysqld </b>processes are started under your own Unix account.

       The following example shows how you might set up an option file
       for use with <b>mysqld_multi</b>. The order in which the <b>mysqld </b>programs
       are started or stopped depends on the order in which they appear
       in the option file. Group numbers need not form an unbroken
       sequence. The first and fifth [mysqld<i>N</i>] groups were intentionally
       omitted from the example to illustrate that you can have “gaps”
       in the option file. This gives you more flexibility.
