       A number of different components are involved in the boot of a
       Linux system. Immediately after power-up, the system firmware
       will do minimal hardware initialization, and hand control over to
       a boot loader (e.g.  <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/systemd-boot.7.html">systemd-boot(7)</a> or <b>GRUB</b><b></b>[1]) stored on a
       persistent storage device. This boot loader will then invoke an
       OS kernel from disk (or the network). On systems using EFI or
       other types of firmware, this firmware may also load the kernel
       directly.

       The kernel (optionally) mounts an in-memory file system, often
       generated by <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/dracut.8.html">dracut(8)</a>, which looks for the root file system.
       Nowadays this is usually implemented as an initramfs â€” a
       compressed archive which is extracted when the kernel boots up
       into a lightweight in-memory file system based on tmpfs, but in
       the past normal file systems using an in-memory block device
       (ramdisk) were used, and the name "initrd" is still used to
       describe both concepts. It's the boot loader or the firmware that
       loads both the kernel and initrd/initramfs images into memory,
       but the kernel which interprets it as a file system.  <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/systemd.1.html">systemd(1)</a>
       may be used to manage services in the initrd, similarly to the
       real system.

       After the root file system is found and mounted, the initrd hands
       over control to the host's system manager (such as <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/systemd.1.html">systemd(1)</a>)
       stored in the root file system, which is then responsible for
       probing all remaining hardware, mounting all necessary file
       systems and spawning all configured services.

       On shutdown, the system manager stops all services, unmounts all
       file systems (detaching the storage technologies backing them),
       and then (optionally) jumps back into the initrd code which
       unmounts/detaches the root file system and the storage it resides
       on. As a last step, the system is powered down.

       Additional information about the system boot process may be found
       in <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/boot.7.html">boot(7)</a>.
