<pre>
       Shrink or extend the size of each FILE to the specified size

       A FILE argument that does not exist is created.

       If a FILE is larger than the specified size, the extra data is
       lost.  If a FILE is shorter, it is extended and the sparse
       extended part (hole) reads as zero bytes.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short
       options too.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--no-create</b>
              do not create any files

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--io-blocks</b>
              treat SIZE as number of IO blocks instead of bytes

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--reference</b>=<i>RFILE</i>
              base size on RFILE

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--size</b>=<i>SIZE</i>
              set or adjust the file size by SIZE bytes

       <b>--help </b>display this help and exit

       <b>--version</b>
              output version information and exit

       The SIZE argument is an integer and optional unit (example: 10K
       is 10*1024).  Units are K,M,G,T,P,E,Z,Y (powers of 1024) or
       KB,MB,... (powers of 1000).  Binary prefixes can be used, too:
       KiB=K, MiB=M, and so on.

       SIZE may also be prefixed by one of the following modifying
       characters: '+' extend by, '-' reduce by, '&lt;' at most, '&gt;' at
       least, '/' round down to multiple of, '%' round up to multiple
       of.
