       This option is used to process data through a custom filter
       provided by a dynamically loaded shared object file. Arguments
       can be passed using --dlarg and retrieved using
       perf_dlfilter_fns.args().

       If <i>file.so</i> does not contain "/", then it will be found either in
       the current directory, or perf tools exec path which is
       ~/libexec/perf-core/dlfilters for a local build and install
       (refer perf --exec-path), or the dynamic linker paths.
