     <b>sudo_sendlog </b>can be used to send the existing <b>sudoers </b>I/O log <i>path</i>
     to a remote log server such as sudo_logsrvd(8) for central storage.

     The options are as follows:

     <b>-A</b>, <b>--accept-only</b>
                 Only send the accept event, not the I/O associated with
                 the log.  This can be used to test the logging of
                 accept events without any associated I/O.

     <b>-b</b>, <b>--ca-bundle</b>
                 The path to a certificate authority bundle file, in PEM
                 format, to use instead of the system's default
                 certificate authority database when authenticating the
                 log server.  The default is to use the system's default
                 certificate authority database.

     <b>-c</b>, <b>--cert  </b>The path to the client's certificate file in PEM
                 format.  This setting is required when the connection
                 to the remote log server is secured with TLS.

     <b>--help      </b>Display a short help message to the standard output and
                 exit.

     <b>-h</b>, <b>--host  </b>Connect to the specified <i>host</i> instead of localhost.

     <b>-i</b>, <b>--iolog-id</b>
                 Use the specified <i>iolog-id</i> when restarting a log
                 transfer.  The <i>iolog-id</i> is reported by the server when
                 it creates the remote I/O log.  This option may only be
                 used in conjunction with the <b>-r </b>option.

     <b>-k</b>, <b>--key   </b>The path to the client's private key file in PEM
                 format.  This setting is required when the connection
                 to the remote log server is secured with TLS.

     <b>-n</b>, <b>--no-verify</b>
                 If specified, the server's certificate will not be
                 verified during the TLS handshake.  By default,
                 <b>sudo_sendlog </b>verifies that the server's certificate is
                 valid and that it contains either the server's host
                 name or its IP address.  This setting is only supported
                 when the connection to the remote log server is secured
                 with TLS.

     <b>-p</b>, <b>--port  </b>Use the specified network <i>port</i> when connecting to the
                 log server instead of the default, port 30344.

     <b>-r</b>, <b>--restart</b>
                 Restart an interrupted connection to the log server.
                 The specified <i>restart-point</i> is used to tell the server
                 the point in time at which to continue the log.  The
                 <i>restart-point</i> is specified in the form
                 “seconds,nanoseconds” and is usually the last commit
                 point received from the server.  The <b>-i </b>option must
                 also be specified when restarting a transfer.

     <b>-R</b>, <b>--reject</b>
                 Send a reject event for the command using the specified
                 <i>reject-reason</i>, even though it was actually accepted
                 locally.  This can be used to test the logging of
                 reject events; no I/O will be sent.

     <b>-s</b>, <b>--stop-after</b>
                 Stop sending log records and close the connection when
                 <i>stop-point</i> is reached.  This can be used for testing
                 purposes to send a partial I/O log to the server.
                 Partial logs can be restarted using the <b>-r </b>option.  The
                 <i>stop-point</i> is an elapsed time specified in the form
                 “seconds,nanoseconds”.

     <b>-t</b>, <b>--test  </b>Open <i>number</i> simultaneous connections to the log server
                 and send the specified I/O log file on each one.  This
                 option is useful for performance testing.

     <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
                 Print the <b>sudo_sendlog </b>version and exit.

   <b>Debugging sendlog</b>
     <b>sudo_sendlog </b>supports a flexible debugging framework that is
     configured via Debug lines in the sudo.conf(5) file.

     For more information on configuring sudo.conf(5), please refer to
     its manual.
