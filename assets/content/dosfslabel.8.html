       <b>fatlabel </b>will display or change the volume label or volume ID on
       the MS-DOS filesystem located on <i>DEVICE</i>.  By default it works in
       label mode.  It can be switched to volume ID mode with the option
       <b>-i </b>or <b>--volume-id</b>.

       If <i>NEW</i> is omitted, then the existing label or volume ID is
       written to the standard output.  A label can't be longer than 11
       bytes and should be in all upper case for best compatibility.  An
       empty string or a label consisting only of white space is not
       allowed.  A volume ID must be given as a hexadecimal number (no
       leading "0x" or similar) and must fit into 32 bits.
