       <b>dh_auto_clean </b>is a debhelper program that tries to automatically
       clean up after a package build. It does so by running the
       appropriate command for the build system it detects the package
       uses. For example, if there's a <i>Makefile</i> and it contains a
       <b>distclean</b>, <b>realclean</b>, or <b>clean </b>target, then this is done by
       running <b>make </b>(or <b>MAKE</b>, if the environment variable is set). If
       there is a <i>setup.py</i> or <i>Build.PL</i>, it is run to clean the package.

       This is intended to work for about 90% of packages. If it doesn't
       work, or tries to use the wrong clean target, you're encouraged
       to skip using <b>dh_auto_clean </b>at all, and just run <b>make clean</b>
       manually.
