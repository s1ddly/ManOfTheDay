       To rerun a batch job is to terminate the session leader of the
       batch job, delete any associated checkpoint files, and return the
       batch job to the batch queued state. A batch job is rerun by a
       request to the batch server that manages the batch job. The
       <i>qrerun</i> utility is a user-accessible batch client that requests
       the rerunning of one or more batch jobs.

       The <i>qrerun</i> utility shall rerun those batch jobs for which a batch
       <i>job_identifier</i> is presented to the utility.

       The <i>qrerun</i> utility shall rerun batch jobs in the order in which
       their batch <i>job_identifier</i>s are presented to the utility.

       If the <i>qrerun</i> utility fails to process any batch <i>job_identifier</i>
       successfully, the utility shall proceed to process the remaining
       batch <i>job_identifier</i>s, if any.

       The <i>qrerun</i> utility shall rerun batch jobs by sending a <i>Rerun Job</i>
       <i>Request</i> to the batch server that manages each batch job.

       For each successfully processed batch <i>job_identifier</i>, the <i>qrerun</i>
       utility shall have rerun the corresponding batch job at the time
       the utility exits.
