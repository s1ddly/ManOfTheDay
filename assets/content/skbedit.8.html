       The <b>skbedit </b>action allows to change a packet's associated meta
       data. It complements the <b>pedit </b>action, which in turn allows to
       change parts of the packet data itself.

       The most unique feature of <b>skbedit </b>is its ability to decide over
       which queue of an interface with multiple transmit queues the
       packet is to be sent out. The number of available transmit queues
       is reflected by sysfs entries within
       <i>/sys/class/net/&lt;interface&gt;/queues</i> with name <i>tx-N</i> (where <i>N</i> is the
       actual queue number).
