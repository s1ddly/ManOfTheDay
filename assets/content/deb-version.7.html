       Version numbers as used for Debian binary and source packages
       consist of three components. These are:

       <i>epoch</i>  This is a single (generally small) unsigned integer.  It
              may be omitted, in which case zero is assumed.  If it is
              omitted then the <i>upstream-version</i> may not contain any
              colons.

              It is provided to allow mistakes in the version numbers of
              older versions of a package, and also a package's previous
              version numbering schemes, to be left behind.

       <i>upstream-version</i>
              This is the main part of the version number.  It is
              usually the version number of the original (“upstream”)
              package from which the <i>.deb</i> file has been made, if this is
              applicable.  Usually this will be in the same format as
              that specified by the upstream author(s); however, it may
              need to be reformatted to fit into the package management
              system's format and comparison scheme.

              The comparison behavior of the package management system
              with respect to the <i>upstream-version</i> is described below.
              The <i>upstream-version</i> portion of the version number is
              mandatory.

              The <i>upstream-version</i> may contain only alphanumerics (“A-
              Za-z0-9”) and the characters <b>. + - : ~ </b>(full stop, plus,
              hyphen, colon, tilde) and should start with a digit.  If
              there is no <i>debian-revision</i> then hyphens are not allowed;
              if there is no <i>epoch</i> then colons are not allowed.

       <i>debian-revision</i>
              This part of the version number specifies the version of
              the Debian package based on the upstream version.  It may
              contain only alphanumerics and the characters <b>+ . ~ </b>(plus,
              full stop, tilde) and is compared in the same way as the
              <i>upstream-version</i> is.

              It is optional; if it isn't present then the <i>upstream-</i>
              <i>version</i> may not contain a hyphen.  This format represents
              the case where a piece of software was written
              specifically to be turned into a Debian package, and so
              there is only one “debianization” of it and therefore no
              revision indication is required.

              It is conventional to restart the <i>debian-revision</i> at ‘1’
              each time the <i>upstream-version</i> is increased.

              Dpkg will break the version number apart at the last
              hyphen in the string (if there is one) to determine the
              <i>upstream-version</i> and <i>debian-revision</i>. The absence of a
              <i>debian-revision</i> compares earlier than the presence of one
              (but note that the <i>debian-revision</i> is the least
              significant part of the version number).

   <b>Sorting algorithm</b>
       The <i>upstream-version</i> and <i>debian-revision</i> parts are compared by
       the package management system using the same algorithm:

       The strings are compared from left to right.

       First the initial part of each string consisting entirely of non-
       digit characters is determined.  These two parts (one of which
       may be empty) are compared lexically.  If a difference is found
       it is returned.  The lexical comparison is a comparison of ASCII
       values modified so that all the letters sort earlier than all the
       non-letters and so that a tilde sorts before anything, even the
       end of a part.  For example, the following parts are in sorted
       order: ‘~~’, ‘~~a’, ‘~’, the empty part, ‘a’.

       Then the initial part of the remainder of each string which
       consists entirely of digit characters is determined.  The
       numerical values of these two parts are compared, and any
       difference found is returned as the result of the comparison.
       For these purposes an empty string (which can only occur at the
       end of one or both version strings being compared) counts as
       zero.

       These two steps (comparing and removing initial non-digit strings
       and initial digit strings) are repeated until a difference is
       found or both strings are exhausted.

       Note that the purpose of epochs is to allow us to leave behind
       mistakes in version numbering, and to cope with situations where
       the version numbering scheme changes.  It is <b>not </b>intended to cope
       with version numbers containing strings of letters which the
       package management system cannot interpret (such as ‘ALPHA’ or
       ‘pre-’), or with silly orderings.
