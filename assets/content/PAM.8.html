       This manual is intended to offer a quick introduction to
       <b>Linux-PAM</b>. For more information the reader is directed to the
       <b>Linux-PAM system administrators' guide</b>.

       <b>Linux-PAM </b>is a system of libraries that handle the authentication
       tasks of applications (services) on the system. The library
       provides a stable general interface (Application Programming
       Interface - API) that privilege granting programs (such as
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/login.1.html">login(1)</a> and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/su.1.html">su(1)</a>) defer to to perform standard authentication
       tasks.

       The principal feature of the PAM approach is that the nature of
       the authentication is dynamically configurable. In other words,
       the system administrator is free to choose how individual
       service-providing applications will authenticate users. This
       dynamic configuration is set by the contents of the single
       <b>Linux-PAM </b>configuration file /etc/pam.conf. Alternatively, the
       configuration can be set by individual configuration files
       located in the /etc/pam.d/ directory. The presence of this
       directory will cause <b>Linux-PAM </b>to <i>ignore</i>/etc/pam.conf.

       Vendor-supplied PAM configuration files might be installed in the
       system directory /usr/lib/pam.d/ instead of the machine
       configuration directory /etc/pam.d/. If no machine configuration
       file is found, the vendor-supplied file is used. All files in
       /etc/pam.d/ override files with the same name in /usr/lib/pam.d/.

       From the point of view of the system administrator, for whom this
       manual is provided, it is not of primary importance to understand
       the internal behavior of the <b>Linux-PAM </b>library. The important
       point to recognize is that the configuration file(s) <i>define</i> the
       connection between applications (<b>services</b>) and the pluggable
       authentication modules (<b>PAM</b>s) that perform the actual
       authentication tasks.

       <b>Linux-PAM </b>separates the tasks of <i>authentication</i> into four
       independent management groups: <b>account </b>management; <b>auth</b>entication
       management; <b>password </b>management; and <b>session </b>management. (We
       highlight the abbreviations used for these groups in the
       configuration file.)

       Simply put, these groups take care of different aspects of a
       typical user's request for a restricted service:

       <b>account </b>- provide account verification types of service: has the
       user's password expired?; is this user permitted access to the
       requested service?

       <b>auth</b>entication - authenticate a user and set up user credentials.
       Typically this is via some challenge-response request that the
       user must satisfy: if you are who you claim to be please enter
       your password. Not all authentications are of this type, there
       exist hardware based authentication schemes (such as the use of
       smart-cards and biometric devices), with suitable modules, these
       may be substituted seamlessly for more standard approaches to
       authentication - such is the flexibility of <b>Linux-PAM</b>.

       <b>password </b>- this group's responsibility is the task of updating
       authentication mechanisms. Typically, such services are strongly
       coupled to those of the <b>auth </b>group. Some authentication
       mechanisms lend themselves well to being updated with such a
       function. Standard UN*X password-based access is the obvious
       example: please enter a replacement password.

       <b>session </b>- this group of tasks cover things that should be done
       prior to a service being given and after it is withdrawn. Such
       tasks include the maintenance of audit trails and the mounting of
       the user's home directory. The <b>session </b>management group is
       important as it provides both an opening and closing hook for
       modules to affect the services available to a user.
