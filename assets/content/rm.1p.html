<pre>
       The <i>rm</i> utility shall remove the directory entry specified by each
       <i>file</i> argument.

       If either of the files dot or dot-dot are specified as the
       basename portion of an operand (that is, the final pathname
       component) or if an operand resolves to the root directory, <i>rm</i>
       shall write a diagnostic message to standard error and do nothing
       more with such operands.

       For each <i>file</i> the following steps shall be taken:

        1. If the <i>file</i> does not exist:

            a. If the <b>-f </b>option is not specified, <i>rm</i> shall write a
               diagnostic message to standard error.

            b. Go on to any remaining <i>files</i>.

        2. If <i>file</i> is of type directory, the following steps shall be
           taken:

            a. If neither the <b>-R </b>option nor the <b>-r </b>option is specified,
               <i>rm</i> shall write a diagnostic message to standard error, do
               nothing more with <i>file</i>, and go on to any remaining files.

            b. If <i>file</i> is an empty directory, <i>rm</i> may skip to step 2d.
               If the <b>-f </b>option is not specified, and either the
               permissions of <i>file</i> do not permit writing and the
               standard input is a terminal or the <b>-i </b>option is
               specified, <i>rm</i> shall write a prompt to standard error and
               read a line from the standard input. If the response is
               not affirmative, <i>rm</i> shall do nothing more with the
               current file and go on to any remaining files.

            c. For each entry contained in <i>file</i>, other than dot or dot-
               dot, the four steps listed here (1 to 4) shall be taken
               with the entry as if it were a <i>file</i> operand. The <i>rm</i>
               utility shall not traverse directories by following
               symbolic links into other parts of the hierarchy, but
               shall remove the links themselves.

            d. If the <b>-i </b>option is specified, <i>rm</i> shall write a prompt to
               standard error and read a line from the standard input.
               If the response is not affirmative, <i>rm</i> shall do nothing
               more with the current file, and go on to any remaining
               files.

        3. If <i>file</i> is not of type directory, the <b>-f </b>option is not
           specified, and either the permissions of <i>file</i> do not permit
           writing and the standard input is a terminal or the <b>-i </b>option
           is specified, <i>rm</i> shall write a prompt to the standard error
           and read a line from the standard input. If the response is
           not affirmative, <i>rm</i> shall do nothing more with the current
           file and go on to any remaining files.

        4. If the current file is a directory, <i>rm</i> shall perform actions
           equivalent to the <i>rmdir</i>() function defined in the System
           Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017 called with a pathname of
           the current file used as the <i>path</i> argument. If the current
           file is not a directory, <i>rm</i> shall perform actions equivalent
           to the <i>unlink</i>() function defined in the System Interfaces
           volume of POSIX.1‐2017 called with a pathname of the current
           file used as the <i>path</i> argument.

           If this fails for any reason, <i>rm</i> shall write a diagnostic
           message to standard error, do nothing more with the current
           file, and go on to any remaining files.

       The <i>rm</i> utility shall be able to descend to arbitrary depths in a
       file hierarchy, and shall not fail due to path length limitations
       (unless an operand specified by the user exceeds system
       limitations).
