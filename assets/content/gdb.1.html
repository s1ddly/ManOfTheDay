       The purpose of a debugger such as GDB is to allow you to see what
       is going on "inside" another program while it executes -- or what
       another program was doing at the moment it crashed.

       GDB can do four main kinds of things (plus other things in
       support of these) to help you catch bugs in the act:

       •   Start your program, specifying anything that might affect its
           behavior.

       •   Make your program stop on specified conditions.

       •   Examine what has happened, when your program has stopped.

       •   Change things in your program, so you can experiment with
           correcting the effects of one bug and go on to learn about
           another.

       You can use GDB to debug programs written in C, C++, Fortran and
       Modula-2.

       GDB is invoked with the shell command "gdb".  Once started, it
       reads commands from the terminal until you tell it to exit with
       the GDB command "quit".  You can get online help from GDB itself
       by using the command "help".

       You can run "gdb" with no arguments or options; but the most
       usual way to start GDB is with one argument or two, specifying an
       executable program as the argument:

               gdb program

       You can also start with both an executable program and a core
       file specified:

               gdb program core

       You can, instead, specify a process ID as a second argument or
       use option "-p", if you want to debug a running process:

               gdb program 1234
               gdb -p 1234

       would attach GDB to process 1234.  With option <b>-p </b>you can omit
       the <i>program</i> filename.

       Here are some of the most frequently needed GDB commands:

       <b>break [</b><i>file</i><b>:]</b><i>function</i>
           Set a breakpoint at <i>function</i> (in <i>file</i>).

       <b>run [</b><i>arglist</i><b>]</b>
           Start your program (with <i>arglist</i>, if specified).

       <b>bt  </b>Backtrace: display the program stack.

       <b>print </b><i>expr</i>
           Display the value of an expression.

       <b>c   </b>Continue running your program (after stopping, e.g. at a
           breakpoint).

       <b>next</b>
           Execute next program line (after stopping); step <i>over</i> any
           function calls in the line.

       <b>edit [</b><i>file</i><b>:]</b><i>function</i>
           look at the program line where it is presently stopped.

       <b>list [</b><i>file</i><b>:]</b><i>function</i>
           type the text of the program in the vicinity of where it is
           presently stopped.

       <b>step</b>
           Execute next program line (after stopping); step <i>into</i> any
           function calls in the line.

       <b>help [</b><i>name</i><b>]</b>
           Show information about GDB command <i>name</i>, or general
           information about using GDB.

       <b>quit</b>
           Exit from GDB.

       the "info" program.
