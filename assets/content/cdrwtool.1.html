       The <b>cdwrtool </b>command can perform certain actions on a CD-R, CD-
       RW, or DVD-R device. Mainly these are blanking the media,
       formatting it for use with the packet-cd device,  and applying an
       UDF filesystem.

       The most common usage is probably the `quick setup' option:

              <b>cdrwtool -d </b><i>device</i> <b>-q</b>

       which will blank the disc, format it as one large track, and
       write the UDF filesystem structures.

       Other options get and set various parameters of how the device is
       set up, and provide for different offsets, modes and settings
       from the defaults.

       The usefulness of most of the options is not explained.
