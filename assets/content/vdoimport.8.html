       vdoimport utility imports VDO volumes created and managed by
       <b>vdo</b>(8) manager into <b>lvm2</b>(8) managed VDO LV. This is realized by
       moving VDO superblock by 2MiB and creating lvm2 metadata at the
       front of this device. The operation is not reversible, thus after
       conversion to lvm2 the access to VDO data is only possible with
       <b>lvm2</b>(8) commands, <b>vdo</b>(8) manager no longer control such volume.
