       <b>pmdaroomtemp </b>is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
       exports the temperature from one or more sensors built using the
       DS2480 and DS1280 chipsets and MicroLAN technology from Dallas
       Semiconductor Corporation.

       The <b>roomtemp </b>PMDA exports metrics that reflect the temperatures
       from one or more of these devices, in both degrees Celcius and
       Fahrenheit.  Each metric has one instance for each temperature
       sensor device.  The external instance identifiers are the serial
       numbers (in hex) of the DS1280 chips discovered when the MicroLAN
       was probed.

       A brief description of the <b>pmdaroomtemp </b>command line options
       follows:

       <b>-d   </b>It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics <i>domain</i>
            number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is,
            <i>domain</i> should be different for every PMDA on the one host,
            and the same <i>domain</i> number should be used for the same PMDA
            on all hosts.

       <b>-l   </b>Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
            <i>roomtemp.log</i> is written in the current directory of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a>
            when <b>pmdaroomtemp </b>is started, i.e.  <b>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd</b>.  If
            the log file cannot be created or is not writable, output is
            written to the standard error instead.
