       The blkdeactivate utility deactivates block devices. For mounted
       block devices, it attempts to unmount it automatically before
       trying to deactivate. The utility currently supports device-
       mapper devices (DM), including LVM volumes and software RAID MD
       devices. LVM volumes are handled directly using the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/lvm.8.html">lvm(8)</a>
       command, the rest of device-mapper based devices are handled
       using the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/dmsetup.8.html">dmsetup(8)</a> command.  MD devices are handled using the
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/mdadm.8.html">mdadm(8)</a> command.
