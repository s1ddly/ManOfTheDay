       <b>script </b>makes a typescript of everything on your terminal session.
       The terminal data are stored in raw form to the log file and
       information about timing to another (optional) structured log
       file. The timing log file is necessary to replay the session
       later by <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/scriptreplay.1.html">scriptreplay(1)</a> and to store additional information
       about the session.

       Since version 2.35, <b>script </b>supports multiple streams and allows
       the logging of input and output to separate files or all the one
       file. This version also supports new timing file which records
       additional information. The command <b>scriptreplay --summary </b>then
       provides all the information.

       If the argument <i>file</i> or option <b>--log-out </b><i>file</i> is given, <b>script</b>
       saves the dialogue in this <i>file</i>. If no filename is given, the
       dialogue is saved in the file <i>typescript</i>.

       Note that logging input using <b>--log-in </b>or <b>--log-io </b>may record
       security-sensitive information as the log file contains all
       terminal session input (e.g., passwords) independently of the
       terminal echo flag setting.
