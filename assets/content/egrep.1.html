       <b>grep </b>searches for <i>PATTERNS</i> in each <i>FILE</i>.  <i>PATTERNS</i> is one or more
       patterns separated by newline characters, and <b>grep </b>prints each
       line that matches a pattern.  Typically <i>PATTERNS</i> should be quoted
       when <b>grep </b>is used in a shell command.

       A <i>FILE</i> of “<b>-</b>” stands for standard input.  If no <i>FILE</i> is given,
       recursive searches examine the working directory, and
       nonrecursive searches read standard input.
