       <b>pmdasimple </b>is a simple Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA)
       which exports a small number of synthetic performance metrics.

       The simple PMDA is shipped as source code and is designed to be
       an aid for PMDA developers.  In terms of code size and features,
       it is more complex than the trivial PMDA, about the same as the
       txmon PMDA and less complex than the sample PMDA.  The source for
       the simple PMDA is a good template from which production,
       customized PMDAs can be developed.

       A brief description of the <b>pmdasimple </b>command line options
       follows:

       <b>-d   </b>It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics <i>domain</i>
            number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is,
            <i>domain</i> should be different for every PMDA on the one host,
            and the same <i>domain</i> number should be used for the same PMDA
            on all hosts.

       <b>-i   </b>Expect PMCD to connect to <b>pmdasimple </b>on the specified TCP/IP
            port.  <i>port</i> may be a port number or port name.

       <b>-l   </b>Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
            <i>simple.log</i> is written in the current directory of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a>
            when <b>pmdasimple </b>is started, i.e.  <b>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd</b>.  If the
            log file cannot be created or is not writable, output is
            written to the standard error instead.

       <b>-p   </b>Expect PMCD to create a pipe and the connection to
            <b>pmdasimple </b>is via standard input and standard output.  This
            is the default connection mode.

       <b>-u   </b>Expect PMCD to connect to <b>pmdasimple </b>on the Unix domain
            socket named <i>socket</i>.

       <b>-U   </b>User account under which to run the agent.  The default is
            the unprivileged "pcp" account in current versions of PCP,
            but in older versions the superuser account ("root") was
            used by default.

       At most one of the options <b>-i</b>, <b>-p </b>and <b>-u </b>may be specified.
