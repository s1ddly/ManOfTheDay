       <b>renice </b>alters the scheduling priority of one or more running
       processes. The first argument is the <i>priority</i> value to be used.
       The other arguments are interpreted as process IDs (by default),
       process group IDs, user IDs, or user names. <b>renice</b>’ing a process
       group causes all processes in the process group to have their
       scheduling priority altered. <b>renice</b>’ing a user causes all
       processes owned by the user to have their scheduling priority
       altered.
