<pre>
       Overwrite the specified FILE(s) repeatedly, in order to make it
       harder for even very expensive hardware probing to recover the
       data.

       If FILE is -, shred standard output.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short
       options too.

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--force</b>
              change permissions to allow writing if necessary

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--iterations</b>=<i>N</i>
              overwrite N times instead of the default (3)

       <b>--random-source</b>=<i>FILE</i>
              get random bytes from FILE

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--size</b>=<i>N</i>
              shred this many bytes (suffixes like K, M, G accepted)

       <b>-u     </b>deallocate and remove file after overwriting

       <b>--remove</b>[=<i>HOW</i>]
              like <b>-u </b>but give control on HOW to delete;  See below

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              show progress

       <b>-x</b>, <b>--exact</b>
              do not round file sizes up to the next full block;

              this is the default for non-regular files

       <b>-z</b>, <b>--zero</b>
              add a final overwrite with zeros to hide shredding

       <b>--help </b>display this help and exit

       <b>--version</b>
              output version information and exit

       Delete FILE(s) if <b>--remove </b>(<b>-u</b>) is specified.  The default is not
       to remove the files because it is common to operate on device
       files like <i>/dev/hda</i>, and those files usually should not be
       removed.  The optional HOW parameter indicates how to remove a
       directory entry: 'unlink' =&gt; use a standard unlink call.  'wipe'
       =&gt; also first obfuscate bytes in the name.  'wipesync' =&gt; also
       sync each obfuscated byte to disk.  The default mode is
       'wipesync', but note it can be expensive.

       CAUTION: shred assumes the file system and hardware overwrite
       data in place.  Although this is common, many platforms operate
       otherwise.  Also, backups and mirrors may contain unremovable
       copies that will let a shredded file be recovered later.  See the
       GNU coreutils manual for details.
