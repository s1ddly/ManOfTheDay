       <b>dh_installwm </b>is a debhelper program that is responsible for
       generating the <i>postinst</i> and <i>prerm</i> commands that register a window
       manager with <b>update-alternatives</b>(8). The window manager's man
       page is also registered as a slave symlink (in v6 mode and up).
       It must be installed in <i>usr/share/man/man1/</i> in the package build
       directory prior to calling <b>dh_installwm</b>.  In compat 9 and
       earlier, the manpage was optional.
