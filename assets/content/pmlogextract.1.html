       <b>pmlogextract </b>reads one or more Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) archive
       logs identified by <i>input</i> and creates a temporally merged and/or
       reduced PCP archive log in <i>output</i>.  <i>input</i> is a comma-separated
       list of names, each of which may be the base name of an archive
       or the name of a directory containing one or more archives.  The
       nature of merging is controlled by the number of input archive
       logs, while the nature of data reduction is controlled by the
       command line arguments.  The input(s) must be sets of PCP archive
       logs created by <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> with performance data collected from
       the <b>same </b>host, but usually over different time periods and
       possibly (although not usually) with different performance
       metrics being logged.

       If only one <i>input</i> is specified, then the default behavior simply
       copies the input set of PCP archive logs, into the output PCP
       archive log.  When two or more sets of PCP archive logs are
       specified as <i>input</i>, the sets of logs are merged (or concatenated)
       and written to <i>output</i>.

       In the output archive log a <i>&lt;mark&gt;</i> record may be inserted at a
       time just past the end of each of the input archive logs to
       indicate a possible temporal discontinuity between the end of one
       input archive log and the start of the next input archive log.
       See the <b>MARK RECORDS </b>section below for more information.  There
       is no <i>&lt;mark&gt;</i> record after the end of the <i>last</i> (in temporal order)
       of the input archive logs.
