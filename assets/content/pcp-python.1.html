       <b>pcp-python </b>has been replaced by <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmpython.1.html">pmpython(1)</a> which is preferred,
       however <b>pcp-python </b>is still installed to provided backwards
       compatibility.

       <b>pcp-python </b>provides a way to run python scripts using a
       customisable python binary, rather than embedding any particular
       version of python into each script.

       This can be useful as it allows version-independent python code
       to be run anywhere.  All python modules shipped with PCP support
       versions 2.6 and later (in the python2 series), and 3.3 and later
       (in the python3 release series).

       Due to python monitoring and collecting scripts being relatively
       simple in PCP (not requiring new modules, language features,
       etc), it has been possible to ensure they work for all of the
       above python versions.  Thus, it is common for PCP python scripts
       to use a "shebang" line that invokes <b>pcp-python </b>as follows:

          <i>#!/usr/bin/pcp python</i>

       This allows the custom setting to be injected instead of a hard-
       coded python version, while still allowing the user to override
       the python version as follows:

          <b>$ PCP_PYTHON_PROG=python3 /usr/bin/pcp python --version</b>
          Python 3.3.2
          <b>$ PCP_PYTHON_PROG=python2 /usr/bin/pcp python --version</b>
          Python 2.7.5

       This is convenient for shipping identical scripts on multiple
       platforms, and for testing different python versions with the one
       script (e.g. in the case where multiple versions of python are
       installed, PCP_PYTHON_PROG can be set in the local environment to
       override the global setting).

       By default, the value of PCP_PYTHON_PROG from <i>/etc/pcp.conf</i> will
       be used.  The default value of this configuration parameter is
       set depending on some heuristics about the target build platform.
       These heuristics favour the use of <i>python3</i> in all recent releases
       of PCP, for those platforms that support it.
