       The GNU implementation of the <i>man</i> macro package is part of the
       <i>groff</i> document formatting system.  It is used to produce manual
       pages (“man pages”) like the one you are reading.

       This document presents the macros thematically; for those needing
       only a quick reference, the following table lists them
       alphabetically, with cross-references to appropriate subsections
       below.

       Macros whose use we discourage (<b>.AT</b>, <b>.DT</b>, <b>.HP</b>, <b>.PD</b>, and <b>.UC</b>) are
       described in subsection “Deprecated features” below.

       Man pages should be encoded using Unicode basic Latin code points
       exclusively, and employ the Unix line-ending convention (U+000A
       only).

   <b>Macro reference preliminaries</b>
       Each macro is described in a tagged paragraph.  Closely related
       macros, such as <b>.EX </b>and <b>.EE</b>, are grouped together.

       A macro call appears on a line starting with a dot (“.”),
       followed by zero or more spaces and then the macro name.  Some
       macros accept arguments; each such argument is separated from the
       macro name and any subsequent arguments by one or more spaces.  A
       newline, unless escaped (see subsection “Portability” below),
       terminates the macro call.

       Optional macro arguments are indicated by surrounding them with
       square brackets.  If a macro accepts multiple arguments, those
       containing space characters must be double-quoted to be
       interpreted correctly.  An empty macro argument can be specified
       with a pair of double-quotes (“""”), but the <i>man</i> package is
       designed such that this should seldom be necessary.  See section
       “Notes” below for examples of cases where better alternatives to
       empty arguments in macro calls are available.  Most macro
       arguments are strings that will be output as text; exceptions are
       noted.

       Bear in mind that <i>groff</i> is fundamentally a programming system for
       typesetting.  Consequently, the verb “to set” is frequently used
       below in the sense “to typeset”.

   <b>Document structure macros</b>
       The highest level of organization of a man page is determined by
       this group of macros.  <b>.TH </b>(title heading) identifies the
       document as a man page and defines information enabling its
       indexing by <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/mandb.8.html">mandb(8)</a> or a similar tool.  Section headings (<b>.SH</b>),
       one of which is mandatory and many of which are standardized,
       facilitate quick location of relevant material by the reader and
       aid the man page writer to discuss all essential aspects of the
       topic.  Subsection headings (<b>.SS</b>) are optional and permit
       sections that grow long to develop in a controlled way.  Many
       technical discussions benefit from examples; lengthy ones,
       especially those reflecting multiple lines of input to or output
       from the system, are usefully bracketed by <b>.EX </b>and <b>.EE</b>.  When
       none of the foregoing meets a structural demand, a region within
       a (sub)section can be manually inset within <b>.RS </b>and <b>.RE </b>macros.

       <b>.TH </b><i>title section</i> [<i>footer-middle</i>] [<i>footer-inside</i>] [<i>header-middle</i>]
              Define the title of the man page as <i>title</i> and the section
              of the manual volume as <i>section</i>.  This use of “section”
              has nothing to do with the section headings otherwise
              discussed in this page; it arises from the organizational
              scheme of printed and bound Unix manuals.  See <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/man.1.html">man(1)</a> for
              details on the section numbers and suffixes applicable to
              your system.  <i>title</i> and <i>section</i> are positioned together at
              the left and right in the header line (with <i>section</i> in
              parentheses immediately appended to <i>title</i>).  <i>footer-middle</i>
              is centered in the footer line.  The arrangement of the
              rest of the footer depends on whether double-sided layout
              is enabled with the option <b>-rD1</b>.  When disabled (the
              default), <i>footer-inside</i> is positioned at the bottom left.
              Otherwise, <i>footer-inside</i> appears at the bottom left on
              odd-numbered (recto) pages, and at the bottom right on
              even-numbered (verso) pages.  The outside footer is the
              page number, except in the continuous-rendering mode
              enabled by the option <b>-rcR=1</b>, in which case it is the
              <i>title</i> and <i>section</i>, as in the header.  <i>header-middle</i> is
              centered in the header line.  If <i>section</i> is a simple
              integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive), or is exactly “3p”,
              there is no need to specify <i>header-middle</i>; the macro
              package will supply text for it.  For HTML output, headers
              and footers are completely suppressed.

              Additionally, this macro starts a new page; the page
              number is reset to 1 (unless the <b>-rC1 </b>option is given).
              This feature is intended only for formatting multiple man
              pages.

              A man page should contain exactly one <b>.TH </b>call at or near
              the beginning of the file, prior to any other macro calls.

              By convention, <i>footer-middle</i> is the most recent
              modification date of the man page source document, and
              <i>footer-inside</i> is the name and version or release of the
              project providing it.

       <b>.SH </b>[<i>heading-text</i>]
              Set <i>heading-text</i> as a section heading.  The text following
              <b>.SH </b>up to the end of the line, or the text on the next
              input line if <b>.SH </b>is given no arguments, is set with no
              indentation, in bold (or the font specified by the string
              <b>HF</b>) and, on typesetter devices, slightly larger than the
              base point size.  If the heading font <b>\*[HF] </b>is bold, use
              of an italic style in <i>heading-text</i> is mapped to the bold-
              italic style if available in the font family.
              Additionally, the left margin and indentation affecting
              subsequent text are reset to their default values.  Text
              on input lines after <i>heading-text</i> is set as an ordinary
              paragraph (<b>.P</b>).

              The content of <i>heading-text</i> and ordering of sections has
              been standardized by common practice, as has much of the
              layout of material within sections.  For example, a
              section called “Name” or “NAME” must exist, must be the
              first section after the <b>.TH </b>call, and must contain only a
              line of the form
                     <i>topic</i>[<b>, </b><i>another-topic</i>]... \- <i>summary-description</i>
              for a man page to be properly indexed.  See <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/man.7.html">man(7)</a> for the
              conventions prevailing on your system.

       <b>.SS </b>[<i>subheading-text</i>]
              Set <i>subheading-text</i> as a subsection heading indented
              between a section heading and an ordinary paragraph (<b>.P</b>).
              See subsection “Horizontal and vertical spacing” below for
              the indentation amount.  The text following <b>.SS </b>up to the
              end of the line, or the text on the next input line if <b>.SS</b>
              is given no arguments, is set in bold (or the font
              specified by the string <b>HF</b>).  If the heading font <b>\*[HF]</b>
              is bold, use of an italic style in <i>heading-text</i> is mapped
              to the bold-italic style if available in the font family.
              Additionally, the left margin and indentation affecting
              subsequent text are reset to their default values.  Text
              on input lines after <i>subheading-text</i> is set as an ordinary
              paragraph (<b>.P</b>).

       <b>.EX</b>
       <b>.EE    </b>Begin and end example.  After <b>.EX</b>, filling is disabled and
              a constant-width (monospaced) font is selected.  Calling
              <b>.EE </b>enables filling and restores the previous font.

              Example regions are useful for formatting code, shell
              sessions, and text file contents.

              These macros are extensions, introduced in Version 9
              Research Unix, to the original <i>man</i> package.  Many systems
              running AT&amp;T, Heirloom Doctools, or Plan 9 <i>troff</i> support
              them.  To be certain your page will be portable to systems
              that do not, copy their definitions from the <i>an-ext.tmac</i>
              file of a <i>groff</i> installation.

       <b>.RS </b>[<i>indent</i>]
              Start a new relative inset level, moving the left margin
              right by <i>indent</i>, if specified, and by a default amount
              otherwise; see subsection “Horizontal and vertical
              spacing” below.  Calls to <b>.RS </b>can be nested; each call
              increments by 1 the inset level used by <b>.RE</b>.  The inset
              level prior to any <b>.RS </b>calls is 1.

       <b>.RE </b>[<i>level</i>]
              End a relative inset; move the left margin back to that
              corresponding to inset level <i>level</i>.  If no argument is
              given, move the left margin one level back.

   <b>Paragraph macros</b>
       An ordinary paragraph (<b>.P</b>) like this one is set without a first-
       line indentation at the current left margin, which by default is
       indented from the leftmost position of the output device.  In man
       pages and other technical literature, definition lists are
       frequently encountered; these can be set as “tagged paragraphs”,
       which have one (<b>.TP</b>) or more (<b>.TQ</b>) leading tags followed by a
       paragraph that has an additional indentation.  The indented
       paragraph (<b>.IP</b>) macro is useful to continue the indented content
       of a narrative started with <b>.TP</b>, or to present an itemized or
       ordered list.  All paragraph macros break the output line at the
       current position.  If another paragraph macro has occurred since
       the previous <b>.SH </b>or <b>.SS</b>, they (except for <b>.TQ</b>) follow the break
       with a default amount of vertical space, which can be changed by
       the deprecated <b>.PD </b>macro; see subsection “Horizontal and vertical
       spacing” below.  They also reset the point size and font style to
       defaults (<b>.TQ </b>again excepted); see subsection “Font style macros”
       below.

       <b>.P</b>
       <b>.LP</b>
       <b>.PP    </b>Begin a new paragraph; these macros are synonymous.  The
              indentation is reset to the default value; the left
              margin, as affected by <b>.RS </b>and <b>.RE</b>, is not.

       <b>.TP </b>[<i>indent</i>]
              Set a paragraph with a leading tag, and the remainder of
              the paragraph indented.  The input line following this
              macro, known as the <i>tag</i>, is printed at the current left
              margin.  Subsequent text is indented by <i>indent</i>, if
              specified, and by a default amount otherwise; see
              subsection “Horizontal and vertical spacing” below.

              If the tag is not as wide as the indentation, the
              paragraph starts on the same line as the tag, at the
              applicable indentation, and continues on the following
              lines.  Otherwise, the descriptive part of the paragraph
              begins on the line following the tag.

              The line containing the tag can include a macro call, for
              instance to set the tag in bold with <b>.B</b>.  <b>.TP </b>was used to
              write the first paragraph of this description of <b>.TP</b>, and
              <b>.IP </b>the subsequent ones.

       <b>.TQ    </b>Set an additional tag for a paragraph tagged with <b>.TP</b>.
              The pending output line is broken.  The tag on the input
              line following this macro and subsequent lines are handled
              as with <b>.TP</b>.

              This macro is a GNU extension not defined on systems
              running AT&amp;T, Plan 9, or Solaris <i>troff</i>; see <i>an-ext.tmac</i> in
              section “Files” below.

              The descriptions of <b>.P</b>, <b>.LP</b>, and <b>.PP </b>above were written
              using <b>.TP </b>and <b>.TQ</b>.

       <b>.IP </b>[<i>tag</i>] [<i>indent</i>]
              Set an indented paragraph with an optional tag.  The <i>tag</i>
              and <i>indent</i> arguments, if present, are handled as with <b>.TP</b>,
              with the exception that the <i>tag</i> argument to <b>.IP </b>cannot
              include a macro call.

              Two convenient uses for <b>.IP </b>are

                     (1) to start a new paragraph with the same
                         indentation as an immediately preceding <b>.IP </b>or
                         <b>.TP </b>paragraph, if no <i>indent</i> argument is given;
                         and

                     (2) to set a paragraph with a short <i>tag</i> that is not
                         semantically important, such as a bullet
                         (•)—obtained with the <b>\(bu </b>special character
                         escape sequence—or list enumerator, as seen in
                         this very paragraph.

   <b>Command synopsis macros</b>
       Command synopses are a staple of section 1 and 8 man pages.
       These macros aid you to construct one that has the classical Unix
       appearance.  A command synopsis is wrapped in <b>.SY</b>/<b>.YS </b>calls, with
       command-line options of some formats indicated by <b>.OP</b>.

       These macros are extensions (<b>.OP </b>from Documenter's Workbench
       <i>troff</i>, <b>.SY </b>and <b>.YS </b>from GNU) not defined on systems running AT&amp;T,
       Plan 9, or Solaris <i>troff</i>; see <i>an-ext.tmac</i> in section “Files”
       below.

       <b>.SY </b><i>command</i>
              Begin synopsis.  A new paragraph is begun at the left
              margin (like <b>.P </b>and its aliases) unless <b>.SY </b>has already
              been called without a corresponding <b>.YS</b>, in which case
              only a break is performed.  Hyphenation is turned off.
              The <i>command</i> argument is set in bold.  The output line is
              filled as normal, but if a break is required, subsequent
              output lines are indented by the width of <i>command</i> plus a
              space.

       <b>.OP </b><i>option-name</i> [<i>option-argument</i>]
              Indicate an optional command parameter called <i>option-name</i>,
              which is set in bold.  If the option takes an argument,
              specify <i>option-argument</i> using a noun, abbreviation, or
              hyphenated noun phrase.  If present, <i>option-argument</i> is
              preceded by a space and set in italics.  Square brackets
              in roman surround both arguments.

       <b>.YS    </b>End synopsis.  Restore previous indentation and initial
              hyphenation mode.

       Multiple <b>.SY</b>/<b>.YS </b>blocks can be specified, for instance to
       distinguish differing modes of operation of a complex command
       like <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/tar.1.html">tar(1)</a>; each will be vertically separated as paragraphs are.

       <b>.SY </b>can also be repeated multiple times before a closing <b>.YS</b>,
       which is useful to indicate synonymous ways of invoking a
       particular mode of operation.

       <i>groff</i>'s own command-line interface serves to illustrate most of
       the specimens of synopsis syntax one is likely to encounter.

       Several features of the above example are of note.

       •      The empty request (.), which does nothing, is used for
              vertical spacing in the input file for readability by the
              document maintainer.  Do not put blank (empty) lines in a
              man page source document.

       •      The command and option names are presented in <b>bold </b>to cue
              the user that they should be input literally.

       •      Option dashes are specified with the <b>\- </b>escape sequence;
              this is an important practice to make them clearly visible
              and to facilitate copy-and-paste from the rendered man
              page to a shell prompt or text file.

       •      Option arguments and command operands are presented in
              <i>italics</i> (but see subsection “Font style macros” below
              regarding terminals) to cue the user that they must be
              replaced with appropriate text.

       •      Symbols that are neither to be typed literally nor
              replaced at the user's discretion appear in the roman
              style; brackets surround optional arguments, and an
              ellipsis indicates that the previous syntactical element
              may be repeated arbitrarily.

       •      The non-breaking adjustable space escape sequence <b>\~ </b>is
              used to prevent the output line from being broken within
              the option brackets.

       •      The output line continuation escape sequence <b>\c </b>is used
              with font style alternation macros to allow all three font
              styles to be set without (breakable) space among them; see
              subsection “Portability” below.

       •      The non-printing input break escape sequence <b>\&amp; </b>follows
              the ellipsis when further text will follow after space on
              the output line.  This keeps the ellipsis's last period
              from being interpreted as the end of a sentence,
              preventing its last period from marking the end of a
              sentence, which would cause additional inter-sentence
              space to be placed after it.  See subsection “Portability”
              below.

   <b>Hyperlink and email macros</b>

              The use of <b>\: </b>to insert non-printing break points is a GNU
              extension and can be omitted.  We place a break point
              <i>before</i> each period so that the reader does not interpret
              the period as ending a sentence.

   <b>Font style macros</b>
       The <i>man</i> macro package is limited in its font styling options,
       offering only <b>bold </b>(<b>.B</b>), <i>italic</i> (<b>.I</b>), and roman.  Italic text is
       usually set underscored instead on terminal devices.  The <b>.SM </b>and
       <b>.SB </b>macros set text in roman or bold, respectively, at a smaller
       point size; these differ visually from regular-sized roman or
       bold text only on typesetter devices.  It is often necessary to
       set text in different styles without intervening space.  The
       macros <b>.BI</b>, <b>.BR</b>, <b>.IB</b>, <b>.IR</b>, <b>.RB</b>, and <b>.RI</b>, where “B”, “I”, and “R”
       indicate bold, italic, and roman, respectively, set their odd-
       and even-numbered arguments in alternating styles, with no space
       separating them.

       Because font styles are presentational rather than semantic,
       conflicting traditions have arisen regarding which font styles
       should be used to mark file or path names, environment variables,
       in-line literals, and man page cross-references.

       The default point size and family for typesetter devices is
       10-point Times, except on the <b>X75-12 </b>and <b>X100-12 </b>devices where
       the point size is 12.  The default style is roman.

       <b>.B </b>[<i>text</i>]
              Set <i>text</i> in bold.  If the macro is given no arguments, the
              text of the next input line is set in bold.

              Use bold for literal portions of syntax synopses, for
              command-line options in running text, and for literals
              that are major topics of the subject under discussion; for
              example, this page uses bold for macro, string, and
              register names.  In an <b>.EX</b>/<b>.EE </b>example of interactive I/O
              (such as a shell session), set only user input in bold.

       <b>.I </b>[<i>text</i>]
              Set <i>text</i> in italics.  If the macro is given no arguments,
              the text of the next input line is set in italics.

              Use italics for file and path names, for environment
              variables, for enumeration or preprocessor constants in C,
              for variable (user-determined) portions of syntax
              synopses, for the first occurrence (only) of a technical
              concept being introduced, for names of works of software
              (including commands and functions, but excluding names of
              operating systems or their kernels), and anywhere a
              parameter requiring replacement by the user is
              encountered.  An exception involves variable text in a
              context that is already marked up in italics, such as file
              or path names with variable components; in such cases,
              follow the convention of mathematical typography: set the
              file or path name in italics as usual but use roman for
              the variable part (see <b>.IR </b>and <b>.RI </b>below), and italics
              again in running roman text when referring to the variable
              material.

       <b>.SM </b>[<i>text</i>]
              Set <i>text</i> one point smaller than the default point size on
              typesetter devices.  If the macro is given no arguments,
              the text of the next input line is set smaller.

              <i>Note</i>: terminals will render <i>text</i> at normal size instead.
              Do not rely upon <b>.SM </b>to communicate semantic information
              distinct from using roman style at normal size; it will be
              hidden from readers using such devices.

       <b>.SB </b>[<i>text</i>]
              Set <i>text</i> in bold and (on typesetter devices) one point
              smaller than the default point size.  If the macro is
              given no arguments, the text of the next input line is set
              smaller and in bold.

              <i>Note</i>: terminals will render <i>text</i> in bold at the normal
              size instead.  Do not rely upon <b>.SB </b>to communicate
              semantic information distinct from using bold style at
              normal size; it will be hidden from readers using such
              devices.

       Note what is <i>not</i> prescribed for setting in bold or italics above:
       elements of “synopsis language” such as ellipses and brackets
       around options; proper names and adjectives; titles of anything
       other than works of literature or software; identifiers for
       standards documents or technical reports such as CSTR #54,
       RFC 1918, Unicode 13.0, or POSIX.1-2017; acronyms; and
       occurrences after the first of a technical term or piece of
       jargon.  Again, the names of operating systems and their kernels
       are, by practically universal convention, set in roman.

       Be frugal with italics for emphasis, and particularly with bold.
       Brief runs of literal text, such as references to individual
       characters or short strings, including section and subsection
       headings of man pages, are suitable objects for quotation; see
       the <b>\(lq</b>, <b>\(rq</b>, <b>\(oq</b>, and <b>\(cq </b>escapes in subsection
       “Portability” below.

       Unlike the above font style macros, the font style alternation
       macros below accept only arguments on the same line as the macro
       call.  Italic corrections are applied as appropriate.  If space
       is required within one of the arguments, first consider whether
       the same result could be achieved with as much clarity by using
       the single-style macros on separate input lines.  When it cannot,
       double-quote an argument containing embedded space characters.
       Setting all three different styles within a word presents
       challenges; it is possible with the <b>\c </b>and/or <b>\f </b>escape
       sequences, but see subsection “Portability” below for caveats.

       <b>.BI </b><i>bold-text italic-text</i> ...
              Set each argument in bold and italics, alternately.

                     .BI \-r\~ reg = n

                     statement specially.

       <b>.RI </b><i>roman-text italic-text</i> ...

   <b>Horizontal and vertical spacing</b>
       The <i>indent</i> argument accepted by <b>.RS</b>, <b>.IP</b>, <b>.TP</b>, and the deprecated
       <b>.HP </b>is a number plus an optional scaling indicator.  If no
       scaling indicator is given, the <i>man</i> package assumes “n”; that is,
       the width of a letter “n” in the font current when the macro is
       called (see section “Numerical Expressions” in <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/groff.7.html">groff(7)</a>).  An
       indentation specified in a call to <b>.IP</b>, <b>.TP</b>, or the deprecated
       <b>.HP </b>persists until (1) another of these macros is called with an
       explicit <i>indent</i> argument, or (2) <b>.SH</b>, <b>.SS</b>, or <b>.P </b>or its synonyms
       is called; these clear the indentation entirely.  Relative insets
       created by <b>.RS </b>move the left margin and persist until <b>.RS</b>, <b>.RE</b>,
       <b>.SH</b>, or <b>.SS </b>is called.

       The indentation amount exhibited by ordinary paragraphs set with
       <b>.P </b>(and its synonyms) not within an <b>.RS</b>/<b>.RE </b>relative inset, and
       the default used when <b>.IP</b>, <b>.RS</b>, <b>.TP</b>, and the deprecated <b>.HP </b>are
       not given an indentation argument, is 7.2n for typesetter devices
       and 7n for terminal devices (but see the <b>-rIN </b>option).  Headers,
       footers (both set with <b>.TH</b>), and section headings (<b>.SH</b>) are set
       with no indentation and subsection headings (<b>.SS</b>) are indented 3n
       (but see the <b>-rSN </b>option).  However, the HTML output device
       ignores indentation completely.

       It may be helpful to think of the left margin and indentation as
       related but distinct concepts; <i>groff</i>'s implementation of the <i>man</i>
       macro package tracks them separately.  The left margin is
       manipulated by <b>.RS </b>and <b>.RE </b>(and by <b>.SH </b>and <b>.SS</b>, which reset it to
       the default).  The other kind of indentation is controlled by the
       paragraphing macros (though, again, <b>.SH </b>and <b>.SS </b>reset it).
       Indentation is imposed by the <b>.TP</b>, <b>.IP</b>, and deprecated <b>.HP</b>
       macros, and cancelled by <b>.P </b>and its synonyms.  An extensive
       example follows.

       This ordinary (<b>.P</b>) paragraph is not in a relative inset nor does
       it possess an indentation.

              Now we have created a relative inset (in other words,
              moved the left margin) with <b>.RS </b>and started another
              ordinary paragraph with <b>.P</b>.

              <b>tag    </b>This tagged paragraph, set with <b>.TP</b>, is still
                     within the <b>.RS </b>region, but lines after the first
                     have a supplementary indentation that the tag
                     lacks.

                     A paragraph like this one, set with <b>.IP</b>, will
                     appear to the reader as also associated with the
                     tag above, because <b>.IP </b>re-uses the previous
                     paragraph's indentation unless given an argument to
                     change it.  This paragraph is affected both by the
                     moved left margin (<b>.RS</b>) and indentation (<b>.IP</b>).

                     ┌─────────────────────────────────┐
                     │This table is affected both by   │
                     │the left margin and indentation. │
                     └─────────────────────────────────┘
              •      This indented paragraph has a bullet for a tag,
                     making it more obvious that the left margin and the
                     paragraph indentation are distinct; only the former
                     affects the tag, but both affect the text of the
                     paragraph.

              This ordinary (<b>.P</b>) paragraph resets the indentation, but
              the left margin is still inset.

              ┌────────────────────────────┐
              │This table is affected only │
              │by the left margin.         │
              └────────────────────────────┘
       Finally, we have ended the relative inset by using <b>.RE</b>, which
       (because we only used one <b>.RS</b>/<b>.RE </b>pair) has reset the left margin
       to the default.  This is an ordinary <b>.P </b>paragraph.

       Resist the temptation to mock up tabular or multi-column output
       with horizontal tab characters or the indentation arguments to
       <b>.IP</b>, <b>.TP</b>, <b>.RS</b>, or the deprecated <b>.HP</b>; the result may not render
       comprehensibly on an output device you fail to check, or which is
       developed in the future.  The table preprocessor <i>tbl</i>(1) can
       likely meet your needs.

       The following macros break the output line and insert vertical
       space: <b>.SH</b>, <b>.SS</b>, <b>.TP</b>, <b>.P </b>(and its synonyms), <b>.IP</b>, and the
       deprecated <b>.HP</b>.  The default inter-section and inter-paragraph
       spacing is is 1v for terminal devices and 0.4v for typesetter
       devices (“v” is a unit of vertical distance, where 1v is the
       distance between adjacent text baselines in a single-spaced
       document).  In <b>.EX</b>/<b>.EE </b>sections, the inter-paragraph spacing is
       1v regardless of output device.  (The deprecated macro <b>.PD </b>can
       change this vertical spacing, but its use is discouraged.)  The
       macros <b>.RS</b>, <b>.RE</b>, <b>.EX</b>, <b>.EE</b>, and <b>.TQ </b>also cause a break but no
       insertion of vertical space.

   <b>Registers</b>
       Registers are described in section “Options” below.  They can be
       set not only on the command line but in the site <i>man.local</i> file
       as well; see section “Files” below.

   <b>Strings</b>
       The following strings are defined for use in man pages.  Others
       are supported for configuration of rendering parameters; see
       section “Options” below.

       <b>\*R    </b>interpolates a special character escape sequence for the
              “registered sign” glyph, <b>\(rg</b>, if available, and “(Reg.)”
              otherwise.

       <b>\*S    </b>interpolates an escape sequence setting the point size to
              the document default.

       <b>\*(lq</b>
       <b>\*(rq  </b>interpolate special character escape sequences for left
              and right double-quotation marks, <b>\(lq </b>and <b>\(rq</b>,
              respectively.

       <b>\*(Tm  </b>interpolate special character escape sequences for the
              “trade mark sign” glyph, <b>\(tm</b>, if available, and “(TM)”
              otherwise.

       None of the above is necessary in a contemporary man page.  <b>\*S</b>
       is superfluous, since point size changes are invisible on
       terminal devices and macros that change it restore its original
       value afterward.  Better alternatives exist for the rest; simply
       use the <b>\(rg</b>, <b>\(lq</b>, <b>\(rq</b>, and <b>\(tm </b>special character escape
       sequences directly.  Unless a man page author is aiming for a
       pathological level of portability, such as the composition of
       pages for consumption on simulators of 1980s Unix systems (or
       Solaris <i>troff</i>, though even it supports <b>\rg</b>), the above strings
       should be avoided.

   <b>Interaction with preprocessors</b>
       When a preprocessor like <i>tbl</i> or <i>eqn</i> is needed, a hint can be
       given to the man page librarian by making the first line of a man
       page look like this:

              <b>'\" </b><i>word</i>

       The line starts with an apostrophe ('), not a dot, and a single
       space character follows the double quote.  The <i>word</i> consists of
       one letter for each needed preprocessor: “e” for <i>eqn</i>, “r” for
       <i>refer</i>, and “t” for <i>tbl</i>.  Modern implementations of the <i>man</i>
       program can use this information to automatically call the
       required preprocessor(s) in the right order.

       The usual <i>tbl</i> and <i>eqn</i> macros for table and equation inclusion,
       <b>.TS</b>, <b>.T&amp;</b>, <b>.TE</b>, <b>.EQ</b>, and <b>.EN</b>, may be used freely.  Terminal
       devices are extremely limited in presentation of mathematical
       equations.

   <b>Portability</b>
       The two major syntactical categories of <i>roff</i> languages are
       requests and escapes.  Since the <i>man</i> macros are implemented in
       terms of <i>groff</i> requests and escapes, one can, in principle,
       supplement the functionality of <i>man</i> with these lower-level
       elements where necessary.

       However, using raw <i>groff</i> requests (apart from the empty request
       “<b>.</b>”) is likely to make your page render poorly when processed by
       other tools; many of these attempt to interpret page sources
       directly for conversion to HTML.  Some requests make implicit
       assumptions about things like character and page sizes that may
       not hold in an HTML environment; also, many of these viewers
       don't interpret the full <i>groff</i> vocabulary, a problem that can
       lead to portions of your text being omitted or presented
       incomprehensibly.

       For portability to modern viewers, it is best to write your page
       entirely with the macros described in this page (except for the
       ones identified as deprecated, which should be avoided).  The
       macros we have described as extensions (<b>.EX</b>/<b>.EE</b>, <b>.SY</b>/<b>.OP</b>/<b>.YS</b>,
       <b>.TQ</b>, <b>.UR</b>/<b>.UE</b>, and <b>.MT</b>/<b>.ME</b>) should be used with caution, as they
       may not yet be built in to some viewer that is important to your
       audience.  See <i>an-ext.tmac</i> in section “Files” below.

       Similar caveats apply to escapes.  Some escape sequences are
       however required for correct typesetting even in man pages and
       usually do not cause portability problems.  Several of these
       render glyphs corresponding to punctuation code points in the
       Unicode basic Latin range (U+0000–U+007F) that are handled
       specially in <i>roff</i> input; the escapes below must be used to render
       them correctly and portably when documenting material that uses
       them syntactically—namely, any of the set <b>' - \ ^ ` ~</b>
       (apostrophe, dash or minus, backslash, caret, grave accent,
       tilde).

       <b>\"     </b>Comment.  Everything after the double-quote to the end of
              the input line is ignored.  Whole-line comments should be
              placed immediately after the empty request “<b>.</b>”).

       <b>\</b><i>newline</i>
              Join the next input line to the current one.  Except for
              the update of the input line counter (used for diagnostic
              messages and related purposes), a series of lines ending
              in backslash-newline appears to <i>groff</i> as a single input
              line.  Use this escape sequence to break excessively long
              input lines for document maintenance.

       <b>\%     </b>Control hyphenation.  The location of this escape sequence
              within a word marks a hyphenation point, supplementing
              <i>groff</i>'s automatic hyphenation patterns.  At the beginning
              of a word, it suppresses any automatic hyphenation points
              within; any specified with <b>\% </b>are still honored.

       <b>\~     </b>Adjustable non-breaking space.  Use this escape sequence
              to prevent a break inside a short phrase or between a
              numerical quantity and its corresponding unit(s).

                     Before starting the motor,
                     set the output speed to\~1.
                     There are 1,024\~bytes in 1\~KiB.
                     CSTR\~#8 documents the B\~language.

       <b>\&amp;     </b>Non-printing input break.  Insert at the beginning of an
              input line to prevent a dot or apostrophe from being
              interpreted as the beginning of a <i>roff</i> request.  Append to
              an end-of-sentence punctuation sequence to keep it from
              being recognized as such.

       <b>\|     </b>Narrow (one-sixth em on typesetters, zero-width on
              terminals) non-breaking space.  Used primarily in ellipses
              (“.\|.\|.”)  to space the dots more pleasantly on
              typesetter devices like PostScript and PDF.

       <b>\-     </b>Minus sign or basic Latin hyphen-minus.  This escape
              sequence produces the Unix command-line option dash in the
              output.  “<b>-</b>” is a hyphen to <i>roff</i>; some output devices
              replace it with U+2010 (hyphen) or similar.

       <b>\(aq   </b>Basic Latin apostrophe.  Some output devices replace “<b>'</b>”
              with a right single quotation mark.

       <b>\(oq</b>
       <b>\(cq   </b>Opening and closing single quotation marks.  Use these for
              paired directional single quotes, ‘like this’.

       <b>\(dq   </b>Basic Latin quotation mark (double quote).  Use in macro
              calls to prevent ‘<b>"</b>” from being interpreted as beginning a
              quoted argument, or simply for readability.

                     .TP
                     .BI "split \(dq" text \(dq

       <b>\(lq</b>
       <b>\(rq   </b>Left and right double quotation marks.  Use these for
              paired directional double quotes, “like this”.

       <b>\(em   </b>Em-dash.  Use for an interruption—such as this one—in a
              sentence.

       <b>\(en   </b>En-dash.  Use to separate the ends of a range,
              particularly between numbers; for example, “the digits
              1–9”.

       <b>\(ga   </b>Basic Latin grave accent.  Some output devices replace “<b>`</b>”
              with a left single quotation mark.

       <b>\(ha   </b>Basic Latin circumflex accent (“hat”).  Some output
              devices replace “<b>^</b>” with U+02C6 (modifier letter
              circumflex accent) or similar.

       <b>\(rs   </b>Reverse solidus (backslash).  The backslash is the default
              <i>groff</i> escape character, so it does not represent itself in
              output.  Also see <b>\e </b>below.

       <b>\(ti   </b>Basic Latin tilde.  Some output devices replace “<b>~</b>” with
              U+02DC (small tilde) or similar.

       <b>\c     </b>End an input line without inserting space or attempting a
              break.  Normally, the end of an input line is treated like
              a space; an output line <i>may</i> be broken there if filling is
              enabled (if not, an adjustable space is inserted), and
              <i>will</i> be broken there when filling is disabled, as in
              <b>.EX</b>/<b>.EE </b>examples.  Anything after <b>\c </b>on the input line is
              ignored.  The next line is interpreted as usual and can
              include a macro call (contrast with <b>\</b><i>newline</i>).  This
              escape sequence is useful when three different font styles
              are needed in a single word, as in a command synopsis,

                     .RB [ \-\-stylesheet=\c
                     .IR name ]

              or on a single line, as in <b>.EX</b>/<b>.EE </b>examples.

                     .EX
                     $ \c
                     .B groff \-T utf8 \-Z \c
                     .I file \c
                     .B | grotty \-i
                     .EE

              Alternatively, and perhaps with better portability, the <b>\f</b>
              font style escape sequence can be used; see below.  Using
              <b>\c </b>to include the output from more than one input line
              into the next-line argument of a <b>.TP </b>macro will render
              incorrectly with <i>groff</i> 1.22.3, <i>mandoc</i> 1.14.1, older
              versions of these programs, and perhaps with some other
              formatters.

       <b>\e     </b>Widely used in man pages to represent a backslash output
              glyph.  It works reliably as long as the “.ec” request is
              not used, which should never happen in man pages, and it
              is slightly more portable than the more explicit <b>\(rs</b>
              (“reverse solidus”) special character escape sequence.

       <b>\fB</b>, <b>\fI</b>, <b>\fR</b>, <b>\fP</b>
              Switch to bold, italic, roman, or back to the previous
              style, respectively.  Either <b>\f </b>or <b>\c </b>is needed when three
              different font styles are required in a word.

                     .RB [ \-\-reference\-dictionary=\fI\,name\/\fP ]

                     .RB [ \-\-reference\-dictionary=\c
                     .IR name ]

              Style escapes may be more portable than <b>\c</b>.  As shown
              above, it is up to you to account for italic corrections
              with “<b>\/</b>” and “<b>\,</b>”, which are themselves GNU extensions,
              if desired and if supported by your implementation.

              <b>\fP </b>reliably returns to the style in use immediately
              preceding the previous <b>\f </b>escape sequence only if no
              sectioning, paragraph, or style macro calls have
              intervened.

              As long as at most two styles are needed in a word, style
              macros like <b>.B </b>and <b>.BI </b>usually result in more readable
              <i>roff</i> source than <b>\f </b>escapes do.

       For maximum portability, escape sequences and special characters
       not listed above are better avoided in man pages.

   <b>Hooks</b>
       Two macros, both GNU extensions, are called internally by the
       <i>groff man</i> package to format page headers and footers and can be
       redefined by the administrator in a site's <i>man.local</i> file (see
       section “Files” below).  The default headers and footers are
       documented in the description of <b>.TH </b>above.  Because these macros
       are hooks for <i>groff man</i> internals, man pages have no reason to
       call them.  A macro definition for these hooks typically consists
       of a “.tl” request.

       <b>.BT    </b>Set the page footer text (“bottom trap”).

       <b>.PT    </b>Set the page header text (“page trap”).

   <b>Deprecated features</b>
       Use of the following in man pages for public distribution is
       discouraged.

       <b>.AT </b>[<i>system</i> [<i>release</i>]]
              Alter the footer for use with legacy AT&amp;T man pages,
              overriding any definition of the <i>footer-inside</i> argument to
              <b>.TH</b>.  This macro exists only for compatibility, to render
              man pages from historical systems.

              The first argument <i>system</i> can be:

                     3      7th edition <i>(default)</i>

                     4      System III

                     5      System V

              The optional second argument <i>release</i> specifies the release
              number, such as in “System V Release 3”.

       <b>.DT    </b>Set tab stops every 0.5i (inches).  Since this macro is
              called by <b>.TH</b>, it would make sense to call it only if a
              man page changes the tab stops.

              Use of this presentation-level macro is deprecated.  It
              translates poorly to HTML, under which exact space control
              and tabulation are not readily available.  Thus,
              information or distinctions that you use <b>.DT </b>to express
              are likely to be lost.  If you feel tempted to use it, you
              should probably be composing a table using <i>tbl</i>(1) markup
              instead.

       <b>.HP </b>[<i>indent</i>]
              Set up a paragraph with a hanging left indentation.  The
              <i>indent</i> argument, if present, is handled as with <b>.TP</b>.

              Use of this presentation-level macro is deprecated.  A
              hanging indentation cannot be expressed naturally under
              HTML, and HTML-based man page processors may interpret it
              as starting an ordinary paragraph.  Thus, any information
              or distinction you mean to express with the indentation
              may be lost.

       <b>.PD </b>[<i>vertical-space</i>]
              Define the vertical space between paragraphs or
              (sub)sections.  The optional argument <i>vertical-space</i>
              specifies the amount; the default scaling indicator is
              “v”.  Without an argument, the spacing is reset to its
              default value; see subsection “Horizontal and vertical
              spacing” above.

              Use of this presentation-level macro is deprecated.  It
              translates poorly to HTML, under which exact control of
              inter-paragraph spacing is not readily available.  Thus,
              information or distinctions that you use <b>.PD </b>to express
              are likely to be lost.

       <b>.UC </b>[<i>version</i>]
              Alter the footer for use with legacy BSD man pages,
              overriding any definition of the <i>footer-inside</i> argument to
              <b>.TH</b>.  This macro exists only for compatibility, to render
              man pages from historical systems.

              The argument <i>version</i> can be:

                     3      3rd Berkeley Distribution <i>(default)</i>

                     4      4th Berkeley Distribution

                     5      4.2 Berkeley Distribution

                     6      4.3 Berkeley Distribution

                     7      4.4 Berkeley Distribution

   <b>History</b>
       Version 7 Unix (1979) introduced the <i>man</i> macro package and
       supported all of the macros described in this page not listed as
       extensions, except <b>.P</b>, <b>.SB</b>, and the deprecated <b>.AT </b>and <b>.UC</b>.  The
       only strings defined were <b>R </b>and <b>S</b>; no registers were documented.
       <b>.UC </b>appeared in 3BSD (1980) and <b>.P </b>in Unix System III (1980).
       PWB/UNIX 2.0 (1980) added the <b>Tm </b>string.  4BSD (1980) added <b>lq</b>
       and <b>rq </b>strings.  4.3BSD (1986) added <b>.AT </b>and <b>.P</b>.  Version 9 Unix
       (1986) introduced <b>.EX </b>and <b>.EE</b>.  SunOS 4.0 (1988) may have been
       the first to support <b>.SB</b>.
