       <b>pmdacisco </b>is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
       extracts performance metrics from one or more Cisco routers.

       A brief description of the <b>pmdacisco </b>command line options
       follows:

       <b>-d   </b>It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics <i>domain</i>
            number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is,
            <i>domain</i> should be different for every PMDA on the one host,
            and the same <i>domain</i> number should be used for the same PMDA
            on all hosts.

       <b>-l   </b>Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
            <i>cisco.log</i> is written in the current directory of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a>
            when <b>pmdacisco </b>is started, i.e.  <i>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd</i>.  If the
            log file cannot be created or is not writable, output is
            written to the standard error instead.

       <b>-P   </b>By default, it is assumed that no user-level password is
            required to access the Cisco's telnet port.  If user-level
            passwords have been enabled on the Ciscos, then those
            passwords must be specified to <b>pmdacisco</b>.  If specified with
            the <b>-P </b>option, <i>password</i> will be used as the default user-
            level password for all Ciscos.  See also the INTERFACE
            IDENTIFICATION section below.

       <b>-r   pmdacisco </b>will refresh the current values for all
            performance metrics by contacting each Cisco router once
            every <i>refresh</i> seconds.  The default <i>refresh</i> is 120 seconds.

       <b>-s   </b>The Cisco command prompt ends with the string <i>prompt</i>.  The
            default value is ``&gt;''.  The only way <b>pmdacisco </b>can
            synchronize the sending of commands and the parsing of
            output is by recognizing <i>prompt</i> as a unique string that
            comes at the end of all output, i.e. as the command prompt
            when waiting for the next command.

       <b>-U   </b>By default, it is assumed that no username login is required
            to access the Cisco's telnet port.  If username login has
            been enabled on the Ciscos, then the corresponding usernames
            must be specified to <b>pmdacisco</b>.  If specified with the <b>-U</b>
            option, <i>username</i> will be used as the default username login
            for all Ciscos.  See also the INTERFACE IDENTIFICATION
            section below.

       <b>-M   </b>User account under which to run the agent.  The default is
            the unprivileged "pcp" account in current versions of PCP,
            but in older versions the superuser account ("root") was
            used by default.

       <b>-x   </b>Connect to the Cisco via TCP port number <i>port</i> rather than
            the default 23 for a telnet connection.

       For each interface, once the telnet connection is established,
       <b>pmdacisco </b>is willing to wait up to 5 seconds for the Cisco to
       provide a new snapshot of the requested information.  If this
       does not happen, the telnet connection is broken and no values
       are returned.  This prevents <b>pmdacisco </b>tying up the Cisco's
       telnet ports waiting indefinitely when the response from the
       router is not what is expected, e.g. if the format of the ``show
       int'' output changes, or the command is in error because an
       interface is no longer configured on the router.
