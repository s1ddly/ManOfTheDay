       Shows the commit ancestry graph starting from the commits named
       with &lt;rev&gt;s or &lt;glob&gt;s (or all refs under refs/heads and/or
       refs/tags) semi-visually.

       It cannot show more than 29 branches and commits at a time.

       It uses <b>showbranch.default </b>multi-valued configuration items if no
       &lt;rev&gt; or &lt;glob&gt; is given on the command line.
