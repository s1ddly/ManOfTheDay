       Flatpak is a tool for managing applications and the runtimes they
       use. In the Flatpak model, applications can be built and
       distributed independently from the host system they are used on,
       and they are isolated from the host system ('sandboxed') to some
       degree, at runtime.

       Flatpak can operate in system-wide or per-user mode. The
       system-wide data (runtimes, applications and configuration) is
       located in $prefix/var/lib/flatpak/, and the per-user data is in
       $HOME/.local/share/flatpak/. Below these locations, there is a
       local repository in the repo/ subdirectory and installed runtimes
       and applications are in the corresponding runtime/ and app/
       subdirectories.

       System-wide remotes can be statically preconfigured by dropping
       flatpakrepo files into /etc/flatpak/remotes.d/.

       In addition to the system-wide installation in
       $prefix/var/lib/flatpak/, which is always considered the default
       one unless overridden, more system-wide installations can be
       defined via configuration files in /etc/flatpak/installations.d/,
       which must define at least the id of the installation and the
       absolute path to it. Other optional parameters like DisplayName,
       Priority or StorageType are also supported.

       Flatpak uses OSTree to distribute and deploy data. The
       repositories it uses are OSTree repositories and can be
       manipulated with the <b>ostree </b>utility. Installed runtimes and
       applications are OSTree checkouts.

       Basic commands for building flatpaks such as build-init, build
       and build-finish are included in the flatpak utility. For
       higher-level build support, see the separate <b>flatpak-builder</b>(1)
       tool.

       Flatpak supports installing from sideload repos. These are
       partial copies of a repository (generated by <b>flatpak create-usb</b>)
       that are used as installation source when offline (and online as
       a performance improvement). Such repositories are configured by
       creating symlinks to the sideload sources in the sideload-repos
       subdirectory of the installation directory (i.e. typically
       /var/lib/flatpak/sideload-repos). Additionally symlinks can be
       created in /run/flatpak/sideload-repos which is a better location
       for non-persistent sources (as it is cleared on reboot). These
       symlinks can point to either the directory given to <b>flatpak</b>
       <b>create-usb </b>which by default writes to the subpath .ostree/repo,
       or directly to an ostree repo.
