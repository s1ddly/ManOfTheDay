<pre>
       Creates a single-file named FILENAME for the application (or
       runtime) named NAME in the repository at LOCATION. If a BRANCH is
       specified, this branch of the application is used.

       The collection ID set on the repository at LOCATION (if set) will
       be used for the bundle.

       Unless <b>--oci </b>is used, the format of the bundle file is that of an
       ostree static delta (against an empty base) with some flatpak
       specific metadata for the application icons and appdata.
