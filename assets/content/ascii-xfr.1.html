       <b>Ascii-xfr </b>Transfers files in ASCII mode. This means no flow
       control, no checksumming and no file-name negotiation. It should
       <i>only</i> be used if the remote system doesn't understand anything
       else.

       The ASCII protocol transfers files line-by-line. The EOL (End-Of-
       Line) character is transmitted as CRLF. When receiving, the CR
       character is stripped from the incoming file.  The Control-Z
       (ASCII 26) character signals End-Of-File, if option -e is
       specified (unless you change it to Control-D (ASCII 4) with -d).

       <b>Ascii-xfr </b>reads from <i>stdin</i> when receiving, and sends data on
       <i>stdout</i> when sending. Some form of input or output redirection to
       the modem device is thus needed when downloading or uploading,
       respectively.
