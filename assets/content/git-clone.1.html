<pre>
       Clones a repository into a newly created directory, creates
       remote-tracking branches for each branch in the cloned repository
       (visible using <b>git branch --remotes</b>), and creates and checks out
       an initial branch that is forked from the cloned repositoryâ€™s
       currently active branch.

       After the clone, a plain <b>git fetch </b>without arguments will update
       all the remote-tracking branches, and a <b>git pull </b>without
       arguments will in addition merge the remote master branch into
       the current master branch, if any (this is untrue when
       "--single-branch" is given; see below).

       This default configuration is achieved by creating references to
       the remote branch heads under <b>refs/remotes/origin </b>and by
       initializing <b>remote.origin.url </b>and <b>remote.origin.fetch</b>
       configuration variables.
