       <b>systemd-repart </b>grows and adds partitions to a partition table,
       based on the configuration files described in <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/repart.d.5.html">repart.d(5)</a>.

       If invoked with no arguments, it operates on the block device
       backing the root file system partition of the running OS, thus
       growing and adding partitions of the booted OS image itself. If
       <i>--image=</i> is used it will operate on the specified image file.
       When called in the "initrd" it operates on the block device
       backing /sysroot/ instead, i.e. on the block device the system
       will soon transition into. The systemd-repart.service service is
       generally run at boot in the initial RAM disk, in order to
       augment the partition table of the OS before its partitions are
       mounted.  <b>systemd-repart </b>(mostly) operates in a purely
       incremental mode: it only grows existing and adds new partitions;
       it does not shrink, delete or move existing partitions. The
       service is intended to be run on every boot, but when it detects
       that the partition table already matches the installed
       repart.d/*.conf configuration files, it executes no operation.

       <b>systemd-repart </b>is intended to be used when deploying OS images,
       to automatically adjust them to the system they are running on,
       during first boot. This way the deployed image can be minimal in
       size and may be augmented automatically at boot when needed,
       taking possession of disk space available but not yet used.
       Specifically the following use cases are among those covered:

       •   The root partition may be grown to cover the whole available
           disk space.

       •   A /home/, swap or /srv/ partition can be added.

       •   A second (or third, ...) root partition may be added, to
           cover A/B style setups where a second version of the root
           file system is alternatingly used for implementing update
           schemes. The deployed image would carry only a single
           partition ("A") but on first boot a second partition ("B")
           for this purpose is automatically created.

       The algorithm executed by <b>systemd-repart </b>is roughly as follows:

        1. The repart.d/*.conf configuration files are loaded and
           parsed, and ordered by filename (without the directory
           prefix).

        2. The partition table already existing on the block device is
           loaded and parsed.

        3. The existing partitions in the partition table are matched up
           with the repart.d/*.conf files by GPT partition type UUID.
           The first existing partition of a specific type is assigned
           the first configuration file declaring the same type. The
           second existing partition of a specific type is then assigned
           the second configuration file declaring the same type, and so
           on. After this iterative assigning is complete any left-over
           existing partitions that have no matching configuration file
           are considered "foreign" and left as they are. And any
           configuration files for which no partition currently exists
           are understood as a request to create such a partition.

        4. Taking the size constraints and weights declared in the
           configuration files into account, all partitions that shall
           be created are now allocated to the disk, taking up all free
           space, always respecting the size and padding requests.
           Similar, existing partitions that are determined to grow are
           grown. New partitions are always appended to the end of the
           existing partition table, taking the first partition table
           slot whose index is greater than the indexes of all existing
           partitions. Partition table slots are never reordered and
           thus partition numbers are ensured to remain stable. Note
           that this allocation happens in RAM only, the partition table
           on disk is not updated yet.

        5. All existing partitions for which configuration files exist
           and which currently have no GPT partition label set will be
           assigned a label, either explicitly configured in the
           configuration or (if that's missing) derived automatically
           from the partition type. The same is done for all partitions
           that are newly created. These assignments are done in RAM
           only, too, the disk is not updated yet.

        6. Similarly, all existing partitions for which configuration
           files exist and which currently have an all-zero identifying
           UUID will be assigned a new UUID. This UUID is
           cryptographically hashed from a common seed value together
           with the partition type UUID (and a counter in case multiple
           partitions of the same type are defined), see below. The same
           is done for all partitions that are created anew. These
           assignments are done in RAM only, too, the disk is not
           updated yet.

        7. Similarly, if the disk's volume UUID is all zeroes it is also
           initialized, also cryptographically hashed from the same
           common seed value. Also, in RAM only, too.

        8. The disk space assigned to new partitions (i.e. what was
           previously considered free space but is no longer) is now
           erased. Specifically, all file system signatures are removed,
           and if the device supports it the <b>BLKDISCARD </b>I/O control
           command is issued to inform the hardware that the space is
           empty now. In addition any "padding" between partitions and
           at the end of the device is similarly erased.

        9. The new partition table is finally written to disk. The
           kernel is asked to reread the partition table.

       As exception to the normally strictly incremental operation, when
       called in a special "factory reset" mode, <b>systemd-repart </b>may also
       be used to erase existing partitions to reset an installation
       back to vendor defaults. This mode of operation is used when
       either the <b>--factory-reset=yes </b>switch is passed on the tool's
       command line, or the <b>systemd.factory_reset=yes </b>option specified
       on the kernel command line, or the <i>FactoryReset</i> EFI variable
       (vendor UUID <b>8cf2644b-4b0b-428f-9387-6d876050dc67</b>) is set to
       "yes". It alters the algorithm above slightly: between the 3rd
       and the 4th step above any partition marked explicitly via the
       <i>FactoryReset=</i> boolean is deleted, and the algorithm restarted,
       thus immediately re-creating these partitions anew empty.

       Note that <b>systemd-repart </b>only changes partition tables, it does
       not create or resize any file systems within these partitions. A
       separate mechanism should be used for that, for example
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/systemd-growfs.8.html">systemd-growfs(8)</a> and <b>systemd-makefs</b>.

       The UUIDs identifying the new partitions created (or assigned to
       existing partitions that have no UUID yet), as well as the disk
       as a whole are hashed cryptographically from a common seed value.
       This seed value is usually the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/machine-id.5.html">machine-id(5)</a> of the system, so
       that the machine ID reproducibly determines the UUIDs assigned to
       all partitions. If the machine ID cannot be read (or the user
       passes <b>--seed=random</b>, see below) the seed is generated randomly
       instead, so that the partition UUIDs are also effectively random.
       The seed value may also be set explicitly, formatted as UUID via
       the <b>--seed= </b>option. By hashing these UUIDs from a common seed
       images prepared with this tool become reproducible and the result
       of the algorithm above deterministic.

       The positional argument should specify the block device to
       operate on. Instead of a block device node path a regular file
       may be specified too, in which case the command operates on it
       like it would if a loopback block device node was specified with
       the file attached. If <b>--empty=create </b>is specified the specified
       path is created as regular file, which is useful for generating
       disk images from scratch.
