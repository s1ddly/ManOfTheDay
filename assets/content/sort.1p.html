       The <i>sort</i> utility shall perform one of the following functions:

        1. Sort lines of all the named files together and write the
           result to the specified output.

        2. Merge lines of all the named (presorted) files together and
           write the result to the specified output.

        3. Check that a single input file is correctly presorted.

       Comparisons shall be based on one or more sort keys extracted
       from each line of input (or, if no sort keys are specified, the
       entire line up to, but not including, the terminating &lt;newline&gt;),
       and shall be performed using the collating sequence of the
       current locale. If this collating sequence does not have a total
       ordering of all characters (see the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‚Äê2017, <i>Section 7.3.2</i>, <i>LC_COLLATE</i>), any lines of input that
       collate equally should be further compared byte-by-byte using the
       collating sequence for the POSIX locale.
