       <b>pcp-dstat </b>is a general performance analysis tool allowing you to
       view multiple system resources instantly, for example you can
       compare disk usage in combination with interrupts from a disk
       controller, or compare the network bandwidth numbers directly
       with the disk throughput (in the same interval).

       It also cleverly gives you the most detailed information in
       columns and clearly indicates in what magnitude and unit the
       output is being displayed.  Less confusion, fewer mistakes, more
       efficient.

       The <i>delay</i> is the delay in seconds between each update, and the
       <i>count</i> is the number of updates to display before exiting.  The
       default <i>delay</i> is 1 second and <i>count</i> is unspecified (run until
       interrupted or end of archive is reached).

       This latest generation of Dstat, <b>pcp-dstat</b>, allows for analysis
       of historical performance data (in the PCP archive format created
       by <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a>), as well as distributed systems analysis of live
       performance data from remote hosts running the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> process.

       The original Dstat notion of ``plugins'' is replaced by use of
       named metrics in a Performance Metric Name Space (<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/PMNS.5.html">PMNS(5)</a>)
       supplied by Performance Metric Domain Agents (PMDAs).  Metrics
       and other formatting information is now specified as plugin
       configuration files in <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/pcp-dstat.5.html">pcp-dstat(5)</a> format.  This new style of
       plugin is either built-in (time-related reporting only), or
       sourced from the system-wide location (<b>$PCP_SYSCONF_DIR/dstat</b>)
       and/or sourced from an individual users set of personal plugins
       (<b>$HOME/.pcp/dstat</b>).

       The list of all available plugins can be seen using the <b>--list</b>
       dstat command line option.
