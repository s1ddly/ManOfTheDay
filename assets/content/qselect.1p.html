       To select a set of batch jobs is to return the batch
       <i>job_identifier</i>s for each batch job that meets a list of selection
       criteria. A set of batch jobs is selected by a request to a batch
       server. The <i>qselect</i> utility is a user-accessible batch client
       that requests the selection of batch jobs.

       Upon successful completion, the <i>qselect</i> utility shall have
       returned a list of zero or more batch <i>job_identifier</i>s that meet
       the criteria specified by the options and option-arguments
       presented to the utility.

       The <i>qselect</i> utility shall select batch jobs by sending a <i>Select</i>
       <i>Jobs Request</i> to a batch server. The <i>qselect</i> utility shall not
       exit until the server replies to each request generated.

       For each option presented to the <i>qselect</i> utility, the utility
       shall restrict the set of selected batch jobs as described in the
       OPTIONS section.

       The <i>qselect</i> utility shall not restrict selection of batch jobs
       except by authorization and as required by the options presented
       to the utility.

       When an option is specified with a mandatory or optional <i>op</i>
       component to the option-argument, then <i>op</i> shall specify a
       relation between the value of a certain batch job attribute and
       the <i>value</i> component of the option-argument. If an <i>op</i> is allowable
       on an option, then the description of the option letter indicates
       the <i>op</i> as either mandatory or optional. Acceptable strings for
       the <i>op</i> component, and the relation the string indicates, are
       shown in the following list:

       .eq.    The value represented by the attribute of the batch job
               is equal to the value represented by the option-argument.

       .ge.    The value represented by the attribute of the batch job
               is greater than or equal to the value represented by the
               option-argument.

       .gt.    The value represented by the attribute of the batch job
               is greater than the value represented by the option-
               argument.

       .lt.    The value represented by the attribute of the batch job
               is less than the value represented by the option-
               argument.

       .le.    The value represented by the attribute of the batch job
               is less than or equal to the value represented by the
               option-argument.

       .ne.    The value represented by the attribute of the batch job
               is not equal to the value represented by the option-
               argument.
