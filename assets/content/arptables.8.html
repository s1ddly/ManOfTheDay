       <b>arptables </b>is a user space tool, it is used to set up and maintain
       the tables of ARP rules in the Linux kernel. These rules inspect
       the ARP frames which they see.  <b>arptables </b>is analogous to the
       <b>iptables </b>user space tool, but <b>arptables </b>is less complicated.

   <b>CHAINS</b>
       The kernel table is used to divide functionality into different
       sets of rules. Each set of rules is called a chain.  Each chain
       is an ordered list of rules that can match ARP frames. If a rule
       matches an ARP frame, then a processing specification tells what
       to do with that matching frame. The processing specification is
       called a 'target'. However, if the frame does not match the
       current rule in the chain, then the next rule in the chain is
       examined and so forth.  The user can create new (user-defined)
       chains which can be used as the 'target' of a rule.

   <b>TARGETS</b>
       A firewall rule specifies criteria for an ARP frame and a frame
       processing specification called a target.  When a frame matches a
       rule, then the next action performed by the kernel is specified
       by the target.  The target can be one of these values: <i>ACCEPT</i>,
       <i>DROP</i>, <i>CONTINUE</i>, <i>RETURN</i>, an 'extension' (see below) or a user-
       defined chain.

       <i>ACCEPT</i> means to let the frame through.  <i>DROP</i> means the frame has
       to be dropped.  <i>CONTINUE</i> means the next rule has to be checked.
       This can be handy to know how many frames pass a certain point in
       the chain or to log those frames.  <i>RETURN</i> means stop traversing
       this chain and resume at the next rule in the previous (calling)
       chain.  For the extension targets please see the <b>TARGET</b>
       <b>EXTENSIONS </b>section of this man page.

   <b>TABLES</b>
       There is only one ARP table in the Linux kernel.  The table is
       <b>filter.  </b>You can drop the '-t filter' argument to the arptables
       command.  The -t argument must be the first argument on the
       arptables command line, if used.

       <b>-t, --table</b>
              <b>filter</b>, is the only table and contains two built-in
              chains: <b>INPUT </b>(for frames destined for the host) and
              <b>OUTPUT </b>(for locally-generated frames).
