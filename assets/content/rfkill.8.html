       <b>rfkill </b>lists, enabling and disabling wireless devices.

       The command "list" output format is deprecated and maintained for
       backward compatibility only. The new output format is the default
       when no command is specified or when the option <b>--output </b>is used.

       The default output is subject to change. So whenever possible,
       you should avoid using default outputs in your scripts. Always
       explicitly define expected columns by using the <b>--output </b>option
       together with a columns list in environments where a stable
       output is required.
