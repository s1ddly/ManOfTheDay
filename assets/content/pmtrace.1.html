       <b>pmtrace </b>provides a simple command line interface to the trace
       Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) and the associated
       <i>pcp_trace</i> library.

       The default <b>pmtrace </b>behavior is to provide point trace data to
       the trace PMDA, using the <i>tag</i> argument as the identifying name
       associated with each trace point.  The <i>tag</i> then becomes an
       instance identifier within the set of trace.point metrics.
