       The nametable shows TIPC publication information.

   <b>Nametable format</b>
       <b>Type</b>
              The 32-bit type field of the port name. The type field
              often indicates the class of service provided by a port.

       <b>Lower</b>
              The lower bound of the 32-bit instance field of the port
              name.  The instance field is often used as as a sub-class
              indicator.

       <b>Upper</b>
              The upper bound of the 32-bit instance field of the port
              name.  The instance field is often used as as a sub-class
              indicator.  A difference in <b>lower </b>and <b>upper </b>means the
              socket is bound to the port name range [lower,upper]

       <b>Port Identity</b>
              The unique socket (port) identifier within the TIPC
              cluster. The <b>port identity </b>consists of a node identity
              followed by a socket reference number.

       <b>Publication</b>
              The <b>publication </b>ID is a random number used internally to
              represent a publication.

       <b>Scope</b>
              The publication <b>scope </b>specifies the visibility of a bound
              port name.  The <b>scope </b>can be specified to comprise three
              different domains: <b>node</b>, <b>cluster </b>and <b>zone.  </b>Applications
              residing within the specified <b>scope </b>can see and access the
              port using the displayed port name.
