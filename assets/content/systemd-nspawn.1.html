       <b>systemd-nspawn </b>may be used to run a command or OS in a
       light-weight namespace container. In many ways it is similar to
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/chroot.1.html">chroot(1)</a>, but more powerful since it fully virtualizes the file
       system hierarchy, as well as the process tree, the various IPC
       subsystems and the host and domain name.

       <b>systemd-nspawn </b>may be invoked on any directory tree containing an
       operating system tree, using the <b>--directory= </b>command line
       option. By using the <b>--machine= </b>option an OS tree is
       automatically searched for in a couple of locations, most
       importantly in /var/lib/machines/, the suggested directory to
       place OS container images installed on the system.

       In contrast to <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/chroot.1.html">chroot(1)</a> <b>systemd-nspawn </b>may be used to boot full
       Linux-based operating systems in a container.

       <b>systemd-nspawn </b>limits access to various kernel interfaces in the
       container to read-only, such as /sys/, /proc/sys/ or
       /sys/fs/selinux/. The host's network interfaces and the system
       clock may not be changed from within the container. Device nodes
       may not be created. The host system cannot be rebooted and kernel
       modules may not be loaded from within the container.

       Use a tool like <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/dnf.8.html">dnf(8)</a>, <b>debootstrap</b>(8), or <b>pacman</b>(8) to set up an
       OS directory tree suitable as file system hierarchy for
       <b>systemd-nspawn </b>containers. See the Examples section below for
       details on suitable invocation of these commands.

       As a safety check <b>systemd-nspawn </b>will verify the existence of
       /usr/lib/os-release or /etc/os-release in the container tree
       before starting the container (see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/os-release.5.html">os-release(5)</a>). It might be
       necessary to add this file to the container tree manually if the
       OS of the container is too old to contain this file
       out-of-the-box.

       <b>systemd-nspawn </b>may be invoked directly from the interactive
       command line or run as system service in the background. In this
       mode each container instance runs as its own service instance; a
       default template unit file systemd-nspawn@.service is provided to
       make this easy, taking the container name as instance identifier.
       Note that different default options apply when <b>systemd-nspawn </b>is
       invoked by the template unit file than interactively on the
       command line. Most importantly the template unit file makes use
       of the <b>--boot </b>which is not the default in case <b>systemd-nspawn </b>is
       invoked from the interactive command line. Further differences
       with the defaults are documented along with the various supported
       options below.

       The <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/machinectl.1.html">machinectl(1)</a> tool may be used to execute a number of
       operations on containers. In particular it provides easy-to-use
       commands to run containers as system services using the
       systemd-nspawn@.service template unit file.

       Along with each container a settings file with the .nspawn suffix
       may exist, containing additional settings to apply when running
       the container. See <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/systemd.nspawn.5.html">systemd.nspawn(5)</a> for details. Settings files
       override the default options used by the systemd-nspawn@.service
       template unit file, making it usually unnecessary to alter this
       template file directly.

       Note that <b>systemd-nspawn </b>will mount file systems private to the
       container to /dev/, /run/ and similar. These will not be visible
       outside of the container, and their contents will be lost when
       the container exits.

       Note that running two <b>systemd-nspawn </b>containers from the same
       directory tree will not make processes in them see each other.
       The PID namespace separation of the two containers is complete
       and the containers will share very few runtime objects except for
       the underlying file system. Use <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/machinectl.1.html">machinectl(1)</a>'s <b>login </b>or <b>shell</b>
       commands to request an additional login session in a running
       container.

       <b>systemd-nspawn </b>implements the <b>Container Interface</b><b></b>[1]
       specification.

       While running, containers invoked with <b>systemd-nspawn </b>are
       registered with the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/systemd-machined.8.html">systemd-machined(8)</a> service that keeps track
       of running containers, and provides programming interfaces to
       interact with them.
