       This module maintains a count of attempted accesses, can reset
       count on success, can deny access if too many attempts fail.

       pam_tally2 comes in two parts: <b>pam_tally2.so </b>and <b>pam_tally2</b>. The
       former is the PAM module and the latter, a stand-alone program.
       <b>pam_tally2 </b>is an (optional) application which can be used to
       interrogate and manipulate the counter file. It can display user
       counts, set individual counts, or clear all counts. Setting
       artificially high counts may be useful for blocking users without
       changing their passwords. For example, one might find it useful
       to clear all counts every midnight from a cron job.

       Normally, failed attempts to access <i>root</i> will <b>not </b>cause the root
       account to become blocked, to prevent denial-of-service: if your
       users aren't given shell accounts and root may only login via <b>su</b>
       or at the machine console (not telnet/rsh, etc), this is safe.
