       Errors that occur during pass 1 (parsing) usually mean a basic
       syntax error of some sort occurred in the systemtap script.
       There are several classes of problems possible:

       plain syntax error
              The systemtap script parser detects a large variety of
              errors, such as missing operands, bad punctuation.  It
              tries to list what kinds of tokens it was expecting to
              see, and will show the region of the source code with the
              problem.  Please review the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/stap.1.html">stap(1)</a> man page and/or the
              tutorial, to correct the script's syntax.

       grammar ambiguities
              There is at least one known ambiguity in the systemtap
              grammar.  It relates to the optionality of <i>;</i> (semicolon)
              separators between statements, and the <i>++</i> and <i>--</i>
              increment/decrement operators.  If the parser indicates an
              error, consider adding some explicit <i>;</i> separators between
              nearby statements and try again.

       missing command line arguments
              A systemtap script that uses the <i>$N</i> and <i>@N</i> constructs for
              substituting in command-line options may fail if not
              enough options were given on the stap command line.

       compatibility changes
              Some versions of systemtap have changed the language
              incompatibly, for example by adding the try/catch keywords
              for exception handling.  In such cases, rerun systemtap
              with the <i>--compatibility=VERSION</i> option, substituting the
              last systemtap version where your script was known to
              work.  You may also check the release-history NEWS file
              for compatibility changes.
