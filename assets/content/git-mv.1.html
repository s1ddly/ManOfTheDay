<pre>
       Move or rename a file, directory or symlink.

           git mv [-v] [-f] [-n] [-k] &lt;source&gt; &lt;destination&gt;
           git mv [-v] [-f] [-n] [-k] &lt;source&gt; ... &lt;destination directory&gt;

       In the first form, it renames &lt;source&gt;, which must exist and be
       either a file, symlink or directory, to &lt;destination&gt;. In the
       second form, the last argument has to be an existing directory;
       the given sources will be moved into this directory.

       The index is updated after successful completion, but the change
       must still be committed.
