       In the absence of the <b>-v </b>(verify) option <b>setcap </b>sets the
       capabilities of each specified <i>filename</i> to the <i>capabilities</i>
       specified.  The optional <b>-n &lt;rootuid&gt; </b>argument can be used to set
       the file capability for use only in a user namespace with this
       root user ID owner. The <b>-v </b>option is used to verify that the
       specified capabilities are currently associated with the file. If
       -v and -n are supplied, the <b>-n &lt;rootuid&gt; </b>argument is also
       verified.

       The <i>capabilities</i> are specified in the form described in
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/cap_from_text.3.html">cap_from_text(3)</a>.

       The special capability string, <b>'-'</b>, can be used to indicate that
       capabilities are read from the standard input. In such cases, the
       capability set is terminated with a blank line.

       The special capability string, <b>'-r'</b>, is used to remove a
       capability set from a file. Note, setting an empty capability set
       is <b>not the same </b>as removing it. An empty set can be used to
       guarantee a file is not executed with privilege in spite of the
       fact that the prevailing ambient+inheritable sets would otherwise
       bestow capabilities on executed binaries.

       The <b>-q </b>flag is used to make the program less verbose in its
       output.
