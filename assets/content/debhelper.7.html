       Debhelper is used to help you build a Debian package. The
       philosophy behind debhelper is to provide a collection of small,
       simple, and easily understood tools that are used in <i>debian/rules</i>
       to automate various common aspects of building a package. This
       means less work for you, the packager.  It also, to some degree
       means that these tools can be changed if Debian policy changes,
       and packages that use them will require only a rebuild to comply
       with the new policy.

       A typical <i>debian/rules</i> file that uses debhelper will call several
       debhelper commands in sequence, or use <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dh.1.html">dh(1)</a> to automate this
       process. Examples of rules files that use debhelper are in
       <i>/usr/share/doc/debhelper/examples/</i>

       To create a new Debian package using debhelper, you can just copy
       one of the sample rules files and edit it by hand. Or you can try
       the <b>dh-make </b>package, which contains a dh_make command that
       partially automates the process. For a more gentle introduction,
       the <b>maint-guide </b>Debian package contains a tutorial about making
       your first package using debhelper.

       Except where the tool explicitly denotes otherwise, all of the
       debhelper tools assume that they run from the root directory of
       an unpacked source package.  This is so they can locate find
       files like <i>debian/control</i> when needed.
