       <b>pmsocks </b>allows Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) clients running on
       hosts located on the internal side of a TCP/IP firewall to
       monitor remote hosts on the other side of the firewall.  This
       assumes the firewall has been configured with a compliant <b>sockd</b>
       daemon and the necessary access controls are satisfied.

       <b>pmsocks </b>is a thin shell wrapper around the <b>tsocks</b>(8) library
       using the <b>tsocks</b>(1) utility, which are not included with PCP.
       You can obtain <b>tsocks </b>from <b><a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pagestps://tsocks.sourceforge.net/">https://tsocks.sourceforge.net/</a> </b>.
