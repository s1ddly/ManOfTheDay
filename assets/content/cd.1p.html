<pre>
       The <i>cd</i> utility shall change the working directory of the current
       shell execution environment (see <i>Section 2.12</i>, <i>Shell Execution</i>
       <i>Environment</i>) by executing the following steps in sequence. (In
       the following steps, the symbol <b>curpath </b>represents an
       intermediate value used to simplify the description of the
       algorithm used by <i>cd</i>.  There is no requirement that <b>curpath </b>be
       made visible to the application.)

        1. If no <i>directory</i> operand is given and the <i>HOME</i> environment
           variable is empty or undefined, the default behavior is
           implementation-defined and no further steps shall be taken.

        2. If no <i>directory</i> operand is given and the <i>HOME</i> environment
           variable is set to a non-empty value, the <i>cd</i> utility shall
           behave as if the directory named in the <i>HOME</i> environment
           variable was specified as the <i>directory</i> operand.

        3. If the <i>directory</i> operand begins with a &lt;slash&gt; character, set
           <b>curpath </b>to the operand and proceed to step 7.

        4. If the first component of the <i>directory</i> operand is dot or
           dot-dot, proceed to step 6.

        5. Starting with the first pathname in the &lt;colon&gt;-separated
           pathnames of <i>CDPATH</i> (see the ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES section)
           if the pathname is non-null, test if the concatenation of
           that pathname, a &lt;slash&gt; character if that pathname did not
           end with a &lt;slash&gt; character, and the <i>directory</i> operand names
           a directory. If the pathname is null, test if the
           concatenation of dot, a &lt;slash&gt; character, and the operand
           names a directory. In either case, if the resulting string
           names an existing directory, set <b>curpath </b>to that string and
           proceed to step 7. Otherwise, repeat this step with the next
           pathname in <i>CDPATH</i> until all pathnames have been tested.

        6. Set <b>curpath </b>to the <i>directory</i> operand.

        7. If the <b>-P </b>option is in effect, proceed to step 10. If <b>curpath</b>
           does not begin with a &lt;slash&gt; character, set <b>curpath </b>to the
           string formed by the concatenation of the value of <i>PWD</i>, a
           &lt;slash&gt; character if the value of <i>PWD</i> did not end with a
           &lt;slash&gt; character, and <b>curpath</b>.

        8. The <b>curpath </b>value shall then be converted to canonical form
           as follows, considering each component from beginning to end,
           in sequence:

            a. Dot components and any &lt;slash&gt; characters that separate
               them from the next component shall be deleted.

            b. For each dot-dot component, if there is a preceding
               component and it is neither root nor dot-dot, then:

                i.  If the preceding component does not refer (in the
                    context of pathname resolution with symbolic links
                    followed) to a directory, then the <i>cd</i> utility shall
                    display an appropriate error message and no further
                    steps shall be taken.

               ii.  The preceding component, all &lt;slash&gt; characters
                    separating the preceding component from dot-dot,
                    dot-dot, and all &lt;slash&gt; characters separating dot-
                    dot from the following component (if any) shall be
                    deleted.

            c. An implementation may further simplify <b>curpath </b>by
               removing any trailing &lt;slash&gt; characters that are not
               also leading &lt;slash&gt; characters, replacing multiple non-
               leading consecutive &lt;slash&gt; characters with a single
               &lt;slash&gt;, and replacing three or more leading &lt;slash&gt;
               characters with a single &lt;slash&gt;.  If, as a result of
               this canonicalization, the <b>curpath </b>variable is null, no
               further steps shall be taken.

        9. If <b>curpath </b>is longer than {PATH_MAX} bytes (including the
           terminating null) and the <i>directory</i> operand was not longer
           than {PATH_MAX} bytes (including the terminating null), then
           <b>curpath </b>shall be converted from an absolute pathname to an
           equivalent relative pathname if possible. This conversion
           shall always be considered possible if the value of <i>PWD</i>, with
           a trailing &lt;slash&gt; added if it does not already have one, is
           an initial substring of <b>curpath</b>.  Whether or not it is
           considered possible under other circumstances is unspecified.
           Implementations may also apply this conversion if <b>curpath </b>is
           not longer than {PATH_MAX} bytes or the <i>directory</i> operand was
           longer than {PATH_MAX} bytes.

       10. The <i>cd</i> utility shall then perform actions equivalent to the
           <i>chdir</i>() function called with <b>curpath </b>as the <i>path</i> argument. If
           these actions fail for any reason, the <i>cd</i> utility shall
           display an appropriate error message and the remainder of
           this step shall not be executed. If the <b>-P </b>option is not in
           effect, the <i>PWD</i> environment variable shall be set to the
           value that <b>curpath </b>had on entry to step 9 (i.e., before
           conversion to a relative pathname). If the <b>-P </b>option is in
           effect, the <i>PWD</i> environment variable shall be set to the
           string that would be output by <i>pwd</i> <b>-P</b>.  If there is
           insufficient permission on the new directory, or on any
           parent of that directory, to determine the current working
           directory, the value of the <i>PWD</i> environment variable is
           unspecified.

       If, during the execution of the above steps, the <i>PWD</i> environment
       variable is set, the <i>OLDPWD</i> environment variable shall also be
       set to the value of the old working directory (that is the
       current working directory immediately prior to the call to <i>cd</i>).
