       <b>rdisc </b>implements client side of the ICMP Internet Router
       Discovery Protocol (IRDP).  <b>rdisc </b>is invoked at boot time to
       populate the network routing tables with default routes.

       <b>rdisc </b>listens on the ALL_HOSTS (224.0.0.1) multicast address (or
       <i>receive_address</i> if it is provided) for ROUTER_ADVERTISE messages
       from routers. The received messages are handled by first ignoring
       those listed router addresses with which the host does not share
       a network. Among the remaining addresses the ones with the
       highest preference are selected as default routers and a default
       route is entered in the kernel routing table for each one of
       them.

       Optionally, <b>rdisc </b>can avoid waiting for routers to announce
       themselves by sending out a few ROUTER_SOLICITATION messages to
       the ALL_ROUTERS (224.0.0.2) multicast address (or <i>send_address</i> if
       it is provided) when it is started.

       A timer is associated with each router address and the address
       will no longer be considered for inclusion in the routing tables
       if the timer expires before a new <b>advertise </b>message is received
       from the router. The address will also be excluded from
       consideration if the received <b>advertise </b>message has a preference
       of maximum negative.

       Server side of router discovery protocol is supported by Cisco
       IOS and by any more or less complete UNIX routing daemon, for
       example <b>gated</b>. If compiled with ENABLE_RDISC_SERVER, <b>rdisc </b>can
       act as responder.
