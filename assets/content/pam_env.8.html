       The pam_env PAM module allows the (un)setting of environment
       variables. Supported is the use of previously set environment
       variables as well as <i>PAM_ITEM</i>s such as <i>PAM_RHOST</i>.

       By default rules for (un)setting of variables are taken from the
       config file /etc/security/pam_env.conf. An alternate file can be
       specified with the <i>conffile</i> option.

       Second a file (/etc/environment by default) with simple <i>KEY=VAL</i>
       pairs on separate lines will be read. With the <i>envfile</i> option an
       alternate file can be specified. And with the <i>readenv</i> option this
       can be completly disabled.

       Third it will read a user configuration file
       ($HOME/.pam_environment by default). The default file file can be
       changed with the <i>user_envfile</i> option and it can be turned on and
       off with the <i>user_readenv</i> option.

       Since setting of PAM environment variables can have side effects
       to other modules, this module should be the last one on the
       stack.
