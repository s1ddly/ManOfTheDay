   <b>tset - initialization</b>
       This program initializes terminals.

       First, <b>@TSET@ </b>retrieves the current terminal mode settings for
       your terminal.  It does this by successively testing

       •   the standard error,

       •   standard output,

       •   standard input and

       •   ultimately “/dev/tty”

       to obtain terminal settings.  Having retrieved these settings,
       <b>@TSET@ </b>remembers which file descriptor to use when updating
       settings.

       Next, <b>@TSET@ </b>determines the type of terminal that you are using.
       This determination is done as follows, using the first terminal
       type found.

       1. The <b>terminal </b>argument specified on the command line.

       2. The value of the <b>TERM </b>environmental variable.

       3. (BSD systems only.) The terminal type associated with the
       standard error output device in the <i>/etc/ttys</i> file.  (On
       System-V-like UNIXes and systems using that convention, <i>getty</i>
       does this job by setting <b>TERM </b>according to the type passed to it
       by <i>/etc/inittab</i>.)

       4. The default terminal type, “unknown”.

       If the terminal type was not specified on the command-line, the
       <b>-m </b>option mappings are then applied (see the section <b>TERMINAL</b>
       <b>TYPE MAPPING </b>for more information).  Then, if the terminal type
       begins with a question mark (“?”), the user is prompted for
       confirmation of the terminal type.  An empty response confirms
       the type, or, another type can be entered to specify a new type.
       Once the terminal type has been determined, the terminal
       description for the terminal is retrieved.  If no terminal
       description is found for the type, the user is prompted for
       another terminal type.

       Once the terminal description is retrieved,

       •   if the “<b>-w</b>” option is enabled, <b>@TSET@ </b>may update the
           terminal's window size.

           If the window size cannot be obtained from the operating
           system, but the terminal description (or environment, e.g.,
           <b>LINES </b>and <b>COLUMNS </b>variables specify this), use this to set
           the operating system's notion of the window size.

       •   if the “<b>-c</b>” option is enabled, the backspace, interrupt and
           line kill characters (among many other things) are set

       •   unless the “<b>-I</b>” option is enabled, the terminal and tab
           <i>initialization</i> strings are sent to the standard error output,
           and <b>@TSET@ </b>waits one second (in case a hardware reset was
           issued).

       •   Finally, if the erase, interrupt and line kill characters
           have changed, or are not set to their default values, their
           values are displayed to the standard error output.

   <b>reset - reinitialization</b>
       When invoked as <b>@RESET@</b>, <b>@TSET@ </b>sets the terminal modes to “sane”
       values:

       •   sets cooked and echo modes,

       •   turns off cbreak and raw modes,

       •   turns on newline translation and

       •   resets any unset special characters to their default values

       before doing the terminal initialization described above.  Also,
       rather than using the terminal <i>initialization</i> strings, it uses
       the terminal <i>reset</i> strings.

       The <b>@RESET@ </b>command is useful after a program dies leaving a
       terminal in an abnormal state:

       •   you may have to type

               <i>&lt;LF&gt;</i><b>@RESET@</b><i>&lt;LF&gt;</i>

           (the line-feed character is normally control-J) to get the
           terminal to work, as carriage-return may no longer work in
           the abnormal state.

       •   Also, the terminal will often not echo the command.
