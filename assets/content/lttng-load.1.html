       The <b>lttng load </b>command loads the configurations of one or more
       tracing sessions from files.

       The <b>lttng load </b>command is used in conjunction with the
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/lttng-save.1.html">lttng-save(1)</a> command to save and restore the complete
       configurations of tracing sessions. This includes the enabled
       channels and event rules, the context added to channels, the
       tracing activity, and more.

       Once one or more tracing session configurations are loaded, they
       appear exactly as they were saved from the user’s point of view.

       The following directories are searched, non-recursively, in this
       order for configuration files:

        1. <b>$LTTNG_HOME/.lttng/sessions </b>(<b>$LTTNG_HOME </b>defaults to <b>$HOME</b>)

        2. <b>/usr/local/etc/lttng/sessions</b>

       The input path can be overridden with the <b>--input-path </b>option.
       When this option is specified, the default directories are NOT
       searched for configuration files. When it’s not specified, <i>both</i>
       default directories are searched for configuration files.

       If the input path is a <b>directory</b>, then:

       •   If <i>SESSION</i> is specified, the tracing session configuration
           named <i>SESSION</i> is searched for in all the files of this
           directory and loaded if found.

       •   If <i>SESSION</i> is not specified, the <b>--all </b>option is implicit:
           all the tracing session configurations found in all the files
           in this directory are loaded.

       If the input path is a <b>file</b>, then:

       •   If <i>SESSION</i> is specified, the tracing session configuration
           named <i>SESSION</i> is searched for in this file and loaded if
           found.

       •   If <i>SESSION</i> is not specified, the <b>--all </b>option is implicit:
           all the tracing session configurations found in this file are
           loaded.

       Aspects of the loaded configurations can be overridden at load
       time using the <b>--override-url </b>and <b>--override-name </b>options.

       By default, existing tracing sessions are not overwritten when
       loading: the command fails. The <b>--force </b>option can be used to
       allow this.
