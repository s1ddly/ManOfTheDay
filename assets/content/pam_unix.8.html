       This is the standard Unix authentication module. It uses standard
       calls from the system's libraries to retrieve and set account
       information as well as authentication. Usually this is obtained
       from the /etc/passwd and the /etc/shadow file as well if shadow
       is enabled.

       The account component performs the task of establishing the
       status of the user's account and password based on the following
       <i>shadow</i> elements: expire, last_change, max_change, min_change,
       warn_change. In the case of the latter, it may offer advice to
       the user on changing their password or, through the
       <b>PAM_AUTHTOKEN_REQD </b>return, delay giving service to the user until
       they have established a new password. The entries listed above
       are documented in the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/shadow.5.html">shadow(5)</a> manual page. Should the user's
       record not contain one or more of these entries, the
       corresponding <i>shadow</i> check is not performed.

       The authentication component performs the task of checking the
       users credentials (password). The default action of this module
       is to not permit the user access to a service if their official
       password is blank.

       A helper binary, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/unix_chkpwd.8.html">unix_chkpwd(8)</a>, is provided to check the user's
       password when it is stored in a read protected database. This
       binary is very simple and will only check the password of the
       user invoking it. It is called transparently on behalf of the
       user by the authenticating component of this module. In this way
       it is possible for applications like <b>xlock</b>(1) to work without
       being setuid-root. The module, by default, will temporarily turn
       off SIGCHLD handling for the duration of execution of the helper
       binary. This is generally the right thing to do, as many
       applications are not prepared to handle this signal from a child
       they didn't know was <b>fork()</b>d. The <b>noreap </b>module argument can be
       used to suppress this temporary shielding and may be needed for
       use with certain applications.

       The maximum length of a password supported by the pam_unix module
       via the helper binary is <i>PAM_MAX_RESP_SIZE</i> - currently 512 bytes.
       The rest of the password provided by the conversation function to
       the module will be ignored.

       The password component of this module performs the task of
       updating the user's password. The default encryption hash is
       taken from the <b>ENCRYPT_METHOD </b>variable from <i>/etc/login.defs</i>

       The session component of this module logs when a user logins or
       leave the system.

       Remaining arguments, supported by others functions of this
       module, are silently ignored. Other arguments are logged as
       errors through <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/syslog.3.html">syslog(3)</a>.
