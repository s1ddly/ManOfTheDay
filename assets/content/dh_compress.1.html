       <b>dh_compress </b>is a debhelper program that is responsible for
       compressing the files in package build directories, and makes
       sure that any symlinks that pointed to the files before they were
       compressed are updated to point to the new files.

       By default, <b>dh_compress </b>compresses files that Debian policy
       mandates should be compressed, namely all files in
       <i>usr/share/info</i>, <i>usr/share/man</i>, files in <i>usr/share/doc</i> that are
       larger than 4k in size, (except the <i>copyright</i> file, <i>.html</i> and
       other web files, image files, and files that appear to be already
       compressed based on their extensions), and all <i>changelog</i> files.
       Plus PCF fonts underneath <i>usr/share/fonts/X11/</i>
