       <b>showmount </b>queries the mount daemon on a remote host for
       information about the state of the NFS server on that machine.
       With no options <b>showmount </b>lists the set of clients who are
       mounting from that host.  The output from <b>showmount </b>is designed
       to appear as though it were processed through ``sort -u''.
