       <b>homectl </b>may be used to create, remove, change or inspect a user's
       home directory. It's primarily a command interfacing with
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/systemd-homed.service.8.html">systemd-homed.service(8)</a> which manages home directories of users.

       Home directories managed by systemd-homed.service are
       self-contained, and thus include the user's full metadata record
       in the home's data storage itself, making them easy to migrate
       between machines. In particular, a home directory describes a
       matching user record, and every user record managed by
       systemd-homed.service also implies existence and encapsulation of
       a home directory. The user account and home directory become the
       same concept.

       The following backing storage mechanisms are supported:

       •   An individual LUKS2 encrypted loopback file for a user,
           stored in /home/*.home. At login the file system contained in
           this files is mounted, after the LUKS2 encrypted volume has
           been attached. The user's password is identical to the
           encryption passphrase of the LUKS2 volume. Access to data
           without preceding user authentication is thus not possible,
           even for the system administrator. This storage mechanism
           provides the strongest data security and is thus recommended.

       •   Similar, but the LUKS2 encrypted file system is located on
           regular block device, such as an USB storage stick. In this
           mode home directories and all data they include are nicely
           migratable between machines, simply by plugging the USB stick
           into different systems at different times.

       •   An encrypted directory using "fscrypt" on file systems that
           support it (at the moment this is primarily "ext4"), located
           in /home/*.homedir. This mechanism also provides encryption,
           but substantially weaker than LUKS2, as most file system
           metadata is unprotected. Moreover it currently does not
           support changing user passwords once the home directory has
           been created.

       •   A "btrfs" subvolume for each user, also located in
           /home/*.homedir. This provides no encryption, but good quota
           support.

       •   A regular directory for each user, also located in
           /home/*.homedir. This provides no encryption, but is a
           suitable fallback available on all machines, even where
           LUKS2, "fscrypt" or "btrfs" support is not available.

       •   An individual Windows file share (CIFS) for each user.

       Note that systemd-homed.service and <b>homectl </b>will not manage
       "classic" UNIX user accounts as created with <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/useradd.8.html">useradd(8)</a> or
       similar tools. In particular, this functionality is not suitable
       for managing system users (i.e. users with a UID below 1000) but
       is exclusive to regular ("human") users.

       Note that users/home directories managed via
       <b>systemd-homed.service </b>do not show up in /etc/passwd and similar
       files, they are synthesized via glibc NSS during runtime. They
       are thus resolvable and may be enumerated via the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/getent.1.html">getent(1)</a> tool.

       This tool interfaces directly with systemd-homed.service, and may
       execute specific commands on the home directories it manages.
       Since every home directory managed that way also defines a JSON
       user and group record these home directories may also be
       inspected and enumerated via <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/userdbctl.1.html">userdbctl(1)</a>.

       Home directories managed by systemd-homed.service are usually in
       one of two states, or in a transition state between them: when
       "active" they are unlocked and mounted, and thus accessible to
       the system and its programs; when "inactive" they are not mounted
       and thus not accessible. Activation happens automatically at
       login of the user and usually can only complete after a password
       (or other authentication token) has been supplied. Deactivation
       happens after the user fully logged out. A home directory remains
       active as long as the user is logged in at least once, i.e. has
       at least one login session. When the user logs in a second time
       simultaneously the home directory remains active. It is
       deactivated only after the last of the user's sessions ends.
