       The <b>lttng rotate </b>command archives the current trace chunk of the
       current tracing session, or of the tracing session named <i>SESSION</i>
       if provided, to the file system. This action is called a tracing
       session <i>rotation</i>.

       Once a trace chunk is archived, LTTng does not manage it anymore:
       you can read it, modify it, move it, or remove it.

       An archived trace chunk is a collection of metadata and data
       stream files which form a self-contained trace.

       The <i>current trace chunk</i> of a given tracing session includes:

       •   The stream files already written to the file system, and
           which are not part of a previously archived trace chunk,
           since the most recent event amongst:

           •   The first time the tracing session was started with
               <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/lttng-start.1.html">lttng-start(1)</a>.

           •   The last rotation, either an immediate one with <b>lttng</b>
               <b>rotate</b>, or an automatic one from a rotation schedule
               previously set with <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/lttng-enable-rotation.1.html">lttng-enable-rotation(1)</a>.

       •   The content of all the non-flushed sub-buffers of the tracing
           session’s channels.

       You can use <b>lttng rotate </b>either at any time when the tracing
       session is active (see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/lttng-start.1.html">lttng-start(1)</a>), or a single time once the
       tracing session becomes inactive (see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/lttng-stop.1.html">lttng-stop(1)</a>).

       By default, the <b>lttng rotate </b>command ensures that the rotation is
       done before printing the archived trace chunk’s path and
       returning to the prompt. The printed path is absolute when the
       tracing session was created in normal mode and relative to the
       relay daemon’s output directory (see the <b>--output </b>option in
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/lttng-relayd.8.html">lttng-relayd(8)</a>) when it was created in network streaming mode
       (see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/lttng-create.1.html">lttng-create(1)</a>).

       With the <b>--no-wait </b>option, the command finishes immediately,
       hence a rotation might not be completed when the command is done.
       In this case, there is no easy way to know when the current trace
       chunk is archived, and the command does not print the archived
       trace chunk’s path.

       Because a rotation causes the tracing session’s current
       sub-buffers to be flushed, archived trace chunks are never
       redundant, that is, they do not overlap over time like snapshots
       can (see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/lttng-snapshot.1.html">lttng-snapshot(1)</a>). Also, a rotation does not directly
       cause discarded event records or packets.

       See <i>LIMITATIONS</i> for important limitations regarding this command.

   <b>Trace chunk archive naming</b>
       A trace chunk archive is a subdirectory of a tracing session’s
       output directory (see the <b>--output </b>option in <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/lttng-create.1.html">lttng-create(1)</a>)
       which contains, through tracing domain and possibly UID/PID
       subdirectories, metadata and data stream files.

       A trace chunk archive is, at the same time:

       •   A self-contained LTTng trace.

       •   A member of a set of trace chunk archives which form the
           complete trace of a tracing session.

       In other words, an LTTng trace reader can read both the tracing
       session output directory (all the trace chunk archives), or a
       single trace chunk archive.

       When a tracing session rotation occurs, the created trace chunk
       archive is named:

           <i>BEGIN</i>-<i>END</i>-<i>ID</i>

       <i>BEGIN</i>
           Date and time of the beginning of the trace chunk archive
           with the ISO 8601-compatible <b>YYYYmmddTHHMMSS±HHMM </b>form, where
           <b>YYYYmmdd </b>is the date and <b>HHMMSS±HHMM </b>is the time with the
           time zone offset from UTC.

           Example: <b>20171119T152407-0500</b>

       <i>END</i>
           Date and time of the end of the trace chunk archive with the
           ISO 8601-compatible <b>YYYYmmddTHHMMSS±HHMM </b>form, where <b>YYYYmmdd</b>
           is the date and <b>HHMMSS±HHMM </b>is the time with the time zone
           offset from UTC.

           Example: <b>20180118T152407+0930</b>

       <i>ID</i>
           Unique numeric identifier of the trace chunk within its
           tracing session.

       Trace chunk archive name example:
       <b>20171119T152407-0500-20171119T151422-0500-3</b>
