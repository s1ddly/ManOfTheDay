       This page describes the conventions that should be employed when
       writing man pages for the Linux <i>man-pages</i> project, which
       documents the user-space API provided by the Linux kernel and the
       GNU C library.  The project thus provides most of the pages in
       Section 2, many of the pages that appear in Sections 3, 4, and 7,
       and a few of the pages that appear in Sections 1, 5, and 8 of the
       man pages on a Linux system.  The conventions described on this
       page may also be useful for authors writing man pages for other
       projects.

   <b>Sections of the manual pages</b>
       The manual Sections are traditionally defined as follows:

       <b>1 User commands (Programs)</b>
              Commands that can be executed by the user from within a
              shell.

       <b>2 System calls</b>
              Functions which wrap operations performed by the kernel.

       <b>3 Library calls</b>
              All library functions excluding the system call wrappers
              (Most of the <i>libc</i> functions).

       <b>4 Special files (devices)</b>
              Files found in <i>/dev</i> which allow to access to devices
              through the kernel.

       <b>5 File formats and configuration files</b>
              Describes various human-readable file formats and
              configuration files.

       <b>6 Games</b>
              Games and funny little programs available on the system.

       <b>7 Overview, conventions, and miscellaneous</b>
              Overviews or descriptions of various topics, conventions,
              and protocols, character set standards, the standard
              filesystem layout, and miscellaneous other things.

       <b>8 System management commands</b>
              Commands like <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/mount.8.html">mount(8)</a>, many of which only root can
              execute.

   <b>Macro package</b>
       New manual pages should be marked up using the <b>groff an.tmac</b>
       package described in <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/man.7.html">man(7)</a>.  This choice is mainly for
       consistency: the vast majority of existing Linux manual pages are
       marked up using these macros.

   <b>Conventions for source file layout</b>
       Please limit source code line length to no more than about 75
       characters wherever possible.  This helps avoid line-wrapping in
       some mail clients when patches are submitted inline.

   <b>Title line</b>
       The first command in a man page should be a <b>TH </b>command:

              <b>.TH </b><i>title section date source manual</i>

       The arguments of the command are as follows:

       <i>title</i>  The title of the man page, written in all caps (e.g., <i>MAN-</i>
              <i>PAGES</i>).

       <i>section</i>
              The section number in which the man page should be placed
              (e.g., <i>7</i>).

       <i>date</i>   The date of the last nontrivial change that was made to
              the man page.  (Within the <i>man-pages</i> project, the
              necessary updates to these timestamps are handled
              automatically by scripts, so there is no need to manually
              update them as part of a patch.)  Dates should be written
              in the form YYYY-MM-DD.

       <i>source</i> The source of the command, function, or system call.

              For those few <i>man-pages</i> pages in Sections 1 and 8,
              probably you just want to write <i>GNU</i>.

              For system calls, just write <i>Linux</i>.  (An earlier practice
              was to write the version number of the kernel from which
              the manual page was being written/checked.  However, this
              was never done consistently, and so was probably worse
              than including no version number.  Henceforth, avoid
              including a version number.)

              For library calls that are part of glibc or one of the
              other common GNU libraries, just use <i>GNU C Library</i>, <i>GNU</i>,
              or an empty string.

              For Section 4 pages, use <i>Linux</i>.

              In cases of doubt, just write <i>Linux</i>, or <i>GNU</i>.

       <i>manual</i> The title of the manual (e.g., for Section 2 and 3 pages
              in the <i>man-pages</i> package, use <i>Linux Programmer's Manual</i>).

   <b>Sections within a manual page</b>
       The list below shows conventional or suggested sections.  Most
       manual pages should include at least the <b>highlighted </b>sections.
       Arrange a new manual page so that sections are placed in the
       order shown in the list.

              <b>NAME</b>

              <b>SEE ALSO</b>

       <i>Where a traditional heading would apply</i>, <i>please use it</i>; this kind
       of consistency can make the information easier to understand.  If
       you must, you can create your own headings if they make things
       easier to understand (this can be especially useful for pages in
       Sections 4 and 5).  However, before doing this, consider whether
       you could use the traditional headings, with some subsections
       (<i>.SS</i>) within those sections.

       The following list elaborates on the contents of each of the
       above sections.

       <b>NAME   </b>The name of this manual page.

              See <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/man.7.html">man(7)</a> for important details of the line(s) that
              should follow the <b>.SH NAME </b>command.  All words in this
              line (including the word immediately following the "\-")
              should be in lowercase, except where English or technical
              terminological convention dictates otherwise.

       <b>SYNOPSIS</b>
              A brief summary of the command or function's interface.

              For commands, this shows the syntax of the command and its
              arguments (including options); boldface is used for as-is
              text and italics are used to indicate replaceable
              arguments.  Brackets ([]) surround optional arguments,
              vertical bars (|) separate choices, and ellipses (...) can
              be repeated.  For functions, it shows any required data
              declarations or <b>#include </b>directives, followed by the
              function declaration.

              Where a feature test macro must be defined in order to
              obtain the declaration of a function (or a variable) from
              a header file, then the SYNOPSIS should indicate this, as
              described in <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/feature_test_macros.7.html">feature_test_macros(7)</a>.

       <b>CONFIGURATION</b>
              Configuration details for a device.

              This section normally appears only in Section 4 pages.

       <b>DESCRIPTION</b>
              An explanation of what the program, function, or format
              does.

              Discuss how it interacts with files and standard input,
              and what it produces on standard output or standard error.
              Omit internals and implementation details unless they're
              critical for understanding the interface.  Describe the
              usual case; for information on command-line options of a
              program use the <b>OPTIONS </b>section.

              When describing new behavior or new flags for a system
              call or library function, be careful to note the kernel or
              C library version that introduced the change.  The
              preferred method of noting this information for flags is
              as part of a <b>.TP </b>list, in the following form (here, for a
              new system call flag):

                       <b>XYZ_FLAG </b>(since Linux 3.7)
                              Description of flag...

              Including version information is especially useful to
              users who are constrained to using older kernel or C
              library versions (which is typical in embedded systems,
              for example).

       <b>OPTIONS</b>
              A description of the command-line options accepted by a
              program and how they change its behavior.

              This section should appear only for Section 1 and 8 manual
              pages.

       <b>EXIT STATUS</b>
              A list of the possible exit status values of a program and
              the conditions that cause these values to be returned.

              This section should appear only for Section 1 and 8 manual
              pages.

       <b>RETURN VALUE</b>
              For Section 2 and 3 pages, this section gives a list of
              the values the library routine will return to the caller
              and the conditions that cause these values to be returned.

       <b>ERRORS </b>For Section 2 and 3 manual pages, this is a list of the
              values that may be placed in <i><a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/errno.3.html">errno</a></i> in the event of an
              error, along with information about the cause of the
              errors.

              Where several different conditions produce the same error,
              the preferred approach is to create separate list entries
              (with duplicate error names) for each of the conditions.
              This makes the separate conditions clear, may make the
              list easier to read, and allows metainformation (e.g.,
              kernel version number where the condition first became
              applicable) to be more easily marked for each condition.

              <i>The error list should be in alphabetical order</i>.

       <b>ENVIRONMENT</b>
              A list of all environment variables that affect the
              program or function and how they affect it.

       <b>FILES  </b>A list of the files the program or function uses, such as
              configuration files, startup files, and files the program
              directly operates on.

              Give the full pathname of these files, and use the
              installation process to modify the directory part to match
              user preferences.  For many programs, the default
              installation location is in <i>/usr/local</i>, so your base
              manual page should use <i>/usr/local</i> as the base.

       <b>ATTRIBUTES</b>
              A summary of various attributes of the function(s)
              documented on this page.  See <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/attributes.7.html">attributes(7)</a> for further
              details.

       <b>VERSIONS</b>
              A brief summary of the Linux kernel or glibc versions
              where a system call or library function appeared, or
              changed significantly in its operation.

              As a general rule, every new interface should include a
              VERSIONS section in its manual page.  Unfortunately, many
              existing manual pages don't include this information
              (since there was no policy to do so when they were
              written).  Patches to remedy this are welcome, but, from
              the perspective of programmers writing new code, this
              information probably matters only in the case of kernel
              interfaces that have been added in Linux 2.4 or later
              (i.e., changes since kernel 2.2), and library functions
              that have been added to glibc since version 2.1 (i.e.,
              changes since glibc 2.0).

              The <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/syscalls.2.html">syscalls(2)</a> manual page also provides information
              about kernel versions in which various system calls first
              appeared.

       <b>CONFORMING TO</b>
              A description of any standards or conventions that relate
              to the function or command described by the manual page.

              The preferred terms to use for the various standards are
              listed as headings in <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/standards.7.html">standards(7)</a>.

              For a page in Section 2 or 3, this section should note the
              POSIX.1 version(s) that the call conforms to, and also
              whether the call is specified in C99.  (Don't worry too
              much about other standards like SUS, SUSv2, and XPG, or
              the SVr4 and 4.xBSD implementation standards, unless the
              call was specified in those standards, but isn't in the
              current version of POSIX.1.)

              If the call is not governed by any standards but commonly
              exists on other systems, note them.  If the call is Linux-
              specific, note this.

              If this section consists of just a list of standards
              (which it commonly does), terminate the list with a period
              ('.').

       <b>NOTES  </b>Miscellaneous notes.

              For Section 2 and 3 man pages you may find it useful to
              include subsections (<b>SS</b>) named <i>Linux Notes</i> and <i>Glibc</i>
              <i>Notes</i>.

              In Section 2, use the heading <i>C library/kernel differences</i>
              to mark off notes that describe the differences (if any)
              between the C library wrapper function for a system call
              and the raw system call interface provided by the kernel.

       <b>BUGS   </b>A list of limitations, known defects or inconveniences,
              and other questionable activities.

       <b>EXAMPLES</b>
              One or more examples demonstrating how this function,
              file, or command is used.

              For details on writing example programs, see <i>Example</i>
              <i>programs</i> below.

       <b>AUTHORS</b>
              A list of authors of the documentation or program.

              <b>Use of an AUTHORS section is strongly discouraged</b>.
              Generally, it is better not to clutter every page with a
              list of (over time potentially numerous) authors; if you
              write or significantly amend a page, add a copyright
              notice as a comment in the source file.  If you are the
              author of a device driver and want to include an address
              for reporting bugs, place this under the BUGS section.

       <b>REPORTING BUGS</b>
              The <i>man-pages</i> project doesn't use a REPORTING BUGS section
              in manual pages.  Information on reporting bugs is instead
              supplied in the script-generated COLOPHON section.
              However, various projects do use a REPORTING BUGS section.
              It is recommended to place it near the foot of the page.

       <b>COPYRIGHT</b>
              The <i>man-pages</i> project doesn't use a COPYRIGHT section in
              manual pages.  Copyright information is instead maintained
              in the page source.  In pages where this section is
              present, it is recommended to place it near the foot of
              the page, just above SEE ALSO.

       <b>SEE ALSO</b>
              A comma-separated list of related man pages, possibly
              followed by other related pages or documents.

              The list should be ordered by section number and then
              alphabetically by name.  Do not terminate this list with a
              period.

              Where the SEE ALSO list contains many long manual page
              names, to improve the visual result of the output, it may
              be useful to employ the <i>.ad l</i> (don't right justify) and
              <i>.nh</i> (don't hyphenate) directives.  Hyphenation of
              individual page names can be prevented by preceding words
              with the string "\%".

              Given the distributed, autonomous nature of FOSS projects
              and their documentation, it is sometimes necessary—and in
              many cases desirable—that the SEE ALSO section includes
              references to manual pages provided by other projects.
