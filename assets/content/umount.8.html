       The <b>umount </b>command detaches the mentioned filesystem(s) from the
       file hierarchy. A filesystem is specified by giving the directory
       where it has been mounted. Giving the special device on which the
       filesystem lives may also work, but is obsolete, mainly because
       it will fail in case this device was mounted on more than one
       directory.

       Note that a filesystem cannot be unmounted when it is 'busy' -
       for example, when there are open files on it, or when some
       process has its working directory there, or when a swap file on
       it is in use. The offending process could even be <b>umount </b>itself -
       it opens libc, and libc in its turn may open for example locale
       files. A lazy unmount avoids this problem, but it may introduce
       other issues. See <b>--lazy </b>description below.
