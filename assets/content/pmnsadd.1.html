       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmnsmerge.1.html">pmnsmerge(1)</a> performs the same function as <b>pmnsadd </b>and is faster,
       more robust and more flexible.  It is therefore recommended that
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmnsmerge.1.html">pmnsmerge(1)</a> be used instead.

       <b>pmnsadd </b>adds subtree(s) of new names into a Performance Metrics
       Name Space (PMNS), as used by the components of the Performance
       Co-Pilot (PCP).

       Normally <b>pmnsadd </b>operates on the default Performance Metrics Name
       Space (PMNS), however if the <b>-n </b>option is specified an
       alternative namespace is used from the file <i>namespace</i>.

       The default PMNS is found in the file <i>$PCP_VAR_DIR/pmns/root</i>
       unless the environment variable <b>PMNS_DEFAULT </b>is set, in which
       case the value is assumed to be the pathname to the file
       containing the default PMNS.

       The new names are specified in the <i>file</i>, arguments and conform to
       the syntax for PMNS specifications, see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/PMNS.5.html">PMNS(5)</a>.  There is one
       PMNS subtree in each <i>file</i>, and the base PMNS pathname to the
       inserted subtree is identified by the first group named in each
       <i>file</i>, e.g. if the specifications begin

                 myagent.foo.stuff {
                     mumble     123:45:1
                     fumble     123:45:2
                 }

       then the new names will be added into the PMNS at the non-leaf
       position identified by myagent.foo.stuff, and following all other
       names with the prefix myagent.foo.

       The new names must be contained within a single subtree of the
       namespace.  If disjoint subtrees need to be added, these must be
       packaged into separate files and <b>pmnsadd </b>used on each, one at a
       time.

       All of the files defining the PMNS must be located within the
       directory that contains the root of the PMNS, this would
       typically be <b>$PCP_VAR_DIR/pmns </b>for the default PMNS, and this
       would typically imply running <b>pmnsadd </b>as root.

       As a special case, if <i>file</i> contains a line that begins root {
       then it is assumed to be a complete PMNS that needs to be merged,
       so none of the subtree extraction and rewriting is performed and
       <i>file</i> is handed directly to <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmnsmerge.1.html">pmnsmerge(1)</a>.

       Provided some initial integrity checks are satisfied, <b>pmnsadd</b>
       will update the PMNS using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmnsmerge.1.html">pmnsmerge(1)</a> - if this fails for any
       reason, the original namespace remains unchanged.
