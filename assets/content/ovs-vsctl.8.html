       The <b>ovs-vsctl </b>program configures <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ovs-vswitchd.8.html">ovs-vswitchd(8)</a> by providing a
       high-level interface to its configuration database.  See
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/ovs-vswitchd.conf.db.5.html">ovs-vswitchd.conf.db(5)</a> for comprehensive documentation of the
       database schema.

       <b>ovs-vsctl </b>connects to an <b>ovsdb-server </b>process that maintains an
       Open vSwitch configuration database.  Using this connection, it
       queries and possibly applies changes to the database, depending
       on the supplied commands.  Then, if it applied any changes, by
       default it waits until <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>has finished reconfiguring
       itself before it exits.  (If you use <b>ovs-vsctl </b>when <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>
       is not running, use <b>--no-wait</b>.)

       <b>ovs-vsctl </b>can perform any number of commands in a single run,
       implemented as a single atomic transaction against the database.

       The <b>ovs-vsctl </b>command line begins with global options (see
       <b>OPTIONS </b>below for details).  The global options are followed by
       one or more commands.  Each command should begin with <b>-- </b>by
       itself as a command-line argument, to separate it from the
       following commands.  (The <b>-- </b>before the first command is
       optional.)  The command itself starts with command-specific
       options, if any, followed by the command name and any arguments.
       See <b>EXAMPLES </b>below for syntax examples.

   <b>Linux VLAN Bridging Compatibility</b>
       The <b>ovs-vsctl </b>program supports the model of a bridge implemented
       by Open vSwitch, in which a single bridge supports ports on
       multiple VLANs.  In this model, each port on a bridge is either a
       trunk port that potentially passes packets tagged with 802.1Q
       headers that designate VLANs or it is assigned a single implicit
       VLAN that is never tagged with an 802.1Q header.

       For compatibility with software designed for the Linux bridge,
       <b>ovs-vsctl </b>also supports a model in which traffic associated with
       a given 802.1Q VLAN is segregated into a separate bridge.  A
       special form of the <b>add-br </b>command (see below) creates a ``fake
       bridge'' within an Open vSwitch bridge to simulate this behavior.
       When such a ``fake bridge'' is active, <b>ovs-vsctl </b>will treat it
       much like a bridge separate from its ``parent bridge,'' but the
       actual implementation in Open vSwitch uses only a single bridge,
       with ports on the fake bridge assigned the implicit VLAN of the
       fake bridge of which they are members.  (A fake bridge for VLAN 0
       receives packets that have no 802.1Q tag or a tag with VLAN 0.)
