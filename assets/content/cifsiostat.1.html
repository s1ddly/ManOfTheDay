       The <b>cifsiostat </b>command displays statistics about read and write
       operations on CIFS filesystems.

       The <i>interval</i> parameter specifies the amount of time in seconds
       between each report. The first report contains statistics for the
       time since system startup (boot). Each subsequent report contains
       statistics collected during the interval since the previous
       report.  A report consists of a CIFS header row followed by a
       line of statistics for each CIFS filesystem that is mounted.  The
       <i>count</i> parameter can be specified in conjunction with the <i>interval</i>
       parameter. If the <i>count</i> parameter is specified, the value of
       <i>count</i> determines the number of reports generated at <i>interval</i>
       seconds apart. If the <i>interval</i> parameter is specified without the
       <i>count</i> parameter, the <b>cifsiostat </b>command generates reports
       continuously.
