       The <b>ovs-pcap </b>program reads the pcap <i>file</i> named on the command
       line and prints each packet's contents as a sequence of hex
       digits on a line of its own.  This format is suitable for use
       with the <b>ofproto/trace </b>command supported by <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ovs-vswitchd.8.html">ovs-vswitchd(8)</a>.
