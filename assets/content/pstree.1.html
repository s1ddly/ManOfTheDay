       <b>pstree </b>shows running processes as a tree.  The tree is rooted at
       either <i>pid</i> or <b>init </b>if <i>pid</i> is omitted.  If a user name is
       specified, all process trees rooted at processes owned by that
       user are shown.

       <b>pstree </b>visually merges identical branches by putting them in
       square brackets and prefixing them with the repetition count,
       e.g.

           init-+-getty
                |-getty
                |-getty
                `-getty

       becomes

           init---4*[getty]

       Child threads of a process are found under the parent process and
       are shown with the process name in curly braces, e.g.

           icecast2---13*[{icecast2}]

       If <b>pstree </b>is called as <b>pstree.x11 </b>then it will prompt the user at
       the end of the line to press return and will not return until
       that has happened.  This is useful for when <b>pstree </b>is run in a
       xterminal.

       Certain kernel or mount parameters, such as the <i>hidepid</i> option
       for procfs, will hide information for some processes. In these
       situations <b>pstree </b>will attempt to build the tree without this
       information, showing process names as question marks.
