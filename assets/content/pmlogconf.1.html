       <b>pmlogconf </b>may be used to create and modify a generic
       configuration file for the PCP archive logger, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a>.

       If <i>configfile</i> does not exist, <b>pmlogconf </b>will create a generic
       configuration file with a default set of enabled metrics and
       logging intervals.

       Once created, <i>configfile</i> may be used with the <b>-c </b>option to
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> to select performance metrics and specify logging
       intervals for a PCP archive.

       If <i>configfile</i> does exist, <b>pmlogconf </b>will prompt for input from
       the user to enable or disable groups of related performance
       metrics and to control the logging interval for each enabled
       group.

       Group selection requires a simple <b>y </b>(yes) or <b>n </b>(no) response to
       the prompt <b>Log this group?</b>.

       Other responses at this point may be used to select additional
       control functions as follows:

       <b>m         </b>Report the names of the metrics in the current group.

       <b>q         </b>Finish with group selection (quit) and make no further
                 changes to this group or any subsequent group.

       <b>/</b><i>pattern</i>  Make no change to this group but search for a group
                 containing <i>pattern</i> in the description of the group or
                 the names of the associated metrics.

       A logging interval is specified by responding to the <b>Logging</b>
       <b>interval?  </b>prompt with the keywords <b>once </b>or <b>default </b>or a valid
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> interval specification of the form ``<b>every </b><i>N</i>
       <i>timeunits</i>'' or simply ``<i>N timeunits ''</i> (the <b>every </b>is optional)
       where <i>N</i> is an unsigned integer and <i>timeunits</i> is one of the
       keywords <b>msec</b>, <b>millisecond</b>, <b>sec</b>, <b>second</b>, <b>min</b>, <b>minute</b>, <b>hour </b>or the
       plural form of one of the keywords.

       When run from automated logging setup processes, the <b>-c </b>option is
       used to indicate that <i>pmlogconf</i> is in auto-create mode and no
       interactive dialog takes place.  The output <i>configfile</i> has an
       additional comment message and timestamp indicating this fact, so
       that it can be identified and subsequently updated using <b>-c</b>
       again.  This option is not appropriate for interactive use of the
       tool.

       The <b>-q </b>option suppresses the logging interval dialog and
       preserves the current interval from <i>configfile</i>.

       More verbose output may be enabled with the <b>-v </b>option.
