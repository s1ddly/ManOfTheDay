       <b>nss-mymachines </b>is a plug-in module for the GNU Name Service
       Switch (NSS) functionality of the GNU C Library (<b>glibc</b>),
       providing hostname resolution for the names of containers running
       locally that are registered with <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/systemd-machined.service.8.html">systemd-machined.service(8)</a>. The
       container names are resolved to the IP addresses of the specific
       container, ordered by their scope. This functionality only
       applies to containers using network namespacing (see the
       description of <b>--private-network </b>in <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/systemd-nspawn.1.html">systemd-nspawn(1)</a>). Note that
       the name that is resolved is the one registered with
       <b>systemd-machined</b>, which may be different than the hostname
       configured inside of the container.

       Note that this NSS module only makes available names of the
       containers running immediately below the current system context.
       It does not provide host name resolution for containers running
       side-by-side with the invoking system context, or containers
       further up or down the container hierarchy. Or in other words, on
       the host system it provides host name resolution for the
       containers running immediately below the host environment. When
       used inside a container environment however, it will not be able
       to provide name resolution for containers running on the host (as
       those are siblings and not children of the current container
       environment), but instead only for nested containers running
       immediately below its own container environment.

       To activate the NSS module, add "mymachines" to the line starting
       with "hosts:" in /etc/nsswitch.conf.

       It is recommended to place "mymachines" before the "resolve" or
       "dns" entry of the "hosts:" line of /etc/nsswitch.conf in order
       to make sure that its mappings are preferred over other resolvers
       such as DNS.
