       <b>manconv </b>converts a manual page from one encoding to another, like
       <b>iconv</b>.  Unlike <b>iconv</b>, it can try multiple possible input
       encodings in sequence.  This is useful for manual pages installed
       in directories without an explicit encoding declaration, since
       they may be in UTF-8 or in a legacy character set.

       If an encoding declaration is found on the first line of the
       manual page, that declaration overrides any input encodings
       specified on <b>manconv</b>'s command line.  Encoding declarations have
       the following form:

              '\" -*- coding: UTF-8 -*-

       or (if manual page preprocessors are also to be declared):

              '\" t -*- coding: ISO-8859-1 -*-
