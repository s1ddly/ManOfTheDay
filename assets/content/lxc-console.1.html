       If the tty service has been configured and is available for the
       container specified as parameter, this command will launch a
       console allowing to log on the container.

       The available tty are free slots taken by this command. That
       means if the container has four ttys available and the command
       has been launched four times each taking a different tty, the
       fifth command will fail because no console will be available.

       The command will connect to a tty. If the connection is lost or
       broken, the command can be launched again and regain the tty at
       the state it was before the disconnection.

       A <i>ttynum</i> of 0 may be given to attach to the container's
       /dev/console instead of its dev/tty&lt;<i>ttynum</i>&gt;.

       A keyboard escape sequence may be used to disconnect from the tty
       and quit lxc-console. The default escape sequence is &lt;Ctrl+a q&gt;.
