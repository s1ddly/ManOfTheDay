       <b>convertquota </b>converts old quota files <b>quota.user </b>and <b>quota.group</b>
       to files <b>aquota.user </b>and <b>aquota.group </b>in new format currently
       used by 2.4.0-ac? and newer or by SuSE or Red Hat Linux 2.4
       kernels on <i>filesystem</i>.

       New file format allows using quotas for 32-bit uids / gids,
       setting quotas for root, accounting used space in bytes (and so
       allowing use of quotas in ReiserFS) and it is also architecture
       independent. This format introduces Radix Tree (a simple form of
       tree structure) to quota file.
