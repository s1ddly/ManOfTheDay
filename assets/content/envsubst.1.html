       Substitutes the values of environment variables.

   <b>Operation mode:</b>
       <b>-v</b>, <b>--variables</b>
              output the variables occurring in SHELL-FORMAT

   <b>Informative output:</b>
       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              display this help and exit

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              output version information and exit

       In normal operation mode, standard input is copied to standard
       output, with references to environment variables of the form
       $VARIABLE or ${VARIABLE} being replaced with the corresponding
       values.  If a SHELL-FORMAT is given, only those environment
       variables that are referenced in SHELL-FORMAT are substituted;
       otherwise all environment variables references occurring in
       standard input are substituted.

       When <b>--variables </b>is used, standard input is ignored, and the
       output consists of the environment variables that are referenced
       in SHELL-FORMAT, one per line.
