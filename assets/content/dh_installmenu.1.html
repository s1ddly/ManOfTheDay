       <b>dh_installmenu </b>is a debhelper program that is responsible for
       installing files used by the Debian <b>menu </b>package into package
       build directories.

       It also automatically generates the <i>postinst</i> and <i>postrm</i> commands
       needed to interface with the Debian <b>menu </b>package. These commands
       are inserted into the maintainer scripts by <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dh_installdeb.1.html">dh_installdeb(1)</a>.
