       Creates a tree object using the current index. The name of the
       new tree object is printed to standard output.

       The index must be in a fully merged state.

       Conceptually, <i>git write-tree</i> sync()s the current index contents
       into a set of tree files. In order to have that match what is
       actually in your directory right now, you need to have done a <i>git</i>
       <i>update-index</i> phase before you did the <i>git write-tree</i>.
