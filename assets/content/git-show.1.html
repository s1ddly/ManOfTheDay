<pre>
       Shows one or more objects (blobs, trees, tags and commits).

       For commits it shows the log message and textual diff. It also
       presents the merge commit in a special format as produced by <i>git</i>
       <i>diff-tree --cc</i>.

       For tags, it shows the tag message and the referenced objects.

       For trees, it shows the names (equivalent to <i>git ls-tree</i> with
       --name-only).

       For plain blobs, it shows the plain contents.

       The command takes options applicable to the <i>git diff-tree</i> command
       to control how the changes the commit introduces are shown.

       This manual page describes only the most frequently used options.
