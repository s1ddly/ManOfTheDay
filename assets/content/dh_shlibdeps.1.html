       <b>dh_shlibdeps </b>is a debhelper program that is responsible for
       calculating shared library dependencies for packages.

       This program is merely a wrapper around <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dpkg-shlibdeps.1.html">dpkg-shlibdeps(1)</a> that
       calls it once for each package listed in the <i>control</i> file,
       passing it a list of ELF executables and shared libraries it has
       found.
