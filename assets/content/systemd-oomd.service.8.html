       <b>systemd-oomd </b>is a system service that uses cgroups-v2 and
       pressure stall information (PSI) to monitor and take action on
       processes before an OOM occurs in kernel space.

       You can enable monitoring and actions on units by setting
       <i>ManagedOOMSwap=</i> and/or <i>ManagedOOMMemoryPressure=</i> to the
       appropriate value.  <b>systemd-oomd </b>will periodically poll enabled
       units' cgroup data to detect when corrective action needs to
       occur. When an action needs to happen, it will only be performed
       on the descendant cgroups of the enabled units. More precisely,
       only cgroups with memory.oom.group set to <b>1 </b>and leaf cgroup nodes
       are eligible candidates. Action will be taken recursively on all
       of the processes under the chosen candidate.

       See <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/oomd.conf.5.html">oomd.conf(5)</a> for more information about the configuration of
       this service.
