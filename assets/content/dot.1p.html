<pre>
       The shell shall execute commands from the <i>file</i> in the current
       environment.

       If <i>file</i> does not contain a &lt;slash&gt;, the shell shall use the
       search path specified by <i>PATH</i> to find the directory containing
       <i>file</i>.  Unlike normal command search, however, the file searched
       for by the <i>dot</i> utility need not be executable. If no readable
       file is found, a non-interactive shell shall abort; an
       interactive shell shall write a diagnostic message to standard
       error, but this condition shall not be considered a syntax error.
