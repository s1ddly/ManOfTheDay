     <b>ssh-keygen </b>generates, manages and converts authentication keys for
     ssh(1).  <b>ssh-keygen </b>can create keys for use by SSH protocol version
     2.

     The type of key to be generated is specified with the <b>-t </b>option.
     If invoked without any arguments, <b>ssh-keygen </b>will generate an RSA
     key.

     <b>ssh-keygen </b>is also used to generate groups for use in Diffie-
     Hellman group exchange (DH-GEX).  See the <i>MODULI GENERATION</i> section
     for details.

     Finally, <b>ssh-keygen </b>can be used to generate and update Key
     Revocation Lists, and to test whether given keys have been revoked
     by one.  See the <i>KEY REVOCATION LISTS</i> section for details.

     Normally each user wishing to use SSH with public key
     authentication runs this once to create the authentication key in
     <i>~/.ssh/id_dsa</i>, <i>~/.ssh/id_ecdsa</i>, <i>~/.ssh/id_ecdsa_sk</i>,
     <i>~/.ssh/id_ed25519</i>, <i>~/.ssh/id_ed25519_sk</i> or <i>~/.ssh/id_rsa</i>.
     Additionally, the system administrator may use this to generate
     host keys, as seen in <i>/etc/rc</i>.

     Normally this program generates the key and asks for a file in
     which to store the private key.  The public key is stored in a file
     with the same name but “.pub” appended.  The program also asks for
     a passphrase.  The passphrase may be empty to indicate no
     passphrase (host keys must have an empty passphrase), or it may be
     a string of arbitrary length.  A passphrase is similar to a
     password, except it can be a phrase with a series of words,
     punctuation, numbers, whitespace, or any string of characters you
     want.  Good passphrases are 10-30 characters long, are not simple
     sentences or otherwise easily guessable (English prose has only 1-2
     bits of entropy per character, and provides very bad passphrases),
     and contain a mix of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and non-
     alphanumeric characters.  The passphrase can be changed later by
     using the <b>-p </b>option.

     There is no way to recover a lost passphrase.  If the passphrase is
     lost or forgotten, a new key must be generated and the
     corresponding public key copied to other machines.

     <b>ssh-keygen </b>will by default write keys in an OpenSSH-specific
     format.  This format is preferred as it offers better protection
     for keys at rest as well as allowing storage of key comments within
     the private key file itself.  The key comment may be useful to help
     identify the key.  The comment is initialized to “user@host” when
     the key is created, but can be changed using the <b>-c </b>option.

     It is still possible for <b>ssh-keygen </b>to write the previously-used
     PEM format private keys using the <b>-m </b>flag.  This may be used when
     generating new keys, and existing new-format keys may be converted
     using this option in conjunction with the <b>-p </b>(change passphrase)
     flag.

     After a key is generated, <b>ssh-keygen </b>will ask where the keys should
     be placed to be activated.

     The options are as follows:

     <b>-A      </b>For each of the key types (rsa, dsa, ecdsa and ed25519) for
             which host keys do not exist, generate the host keys with
             the default key file path, an empty passphrase, default
             bits for the key type, and default comment.  If <b>-f </b>has also
             been specified, its argument is used as a prefix to the
             default path for the resulting host key files.  This is
             used by <i>/etc/rc</i> to generate new host keys.

     <b>-a </b><i>rounds</i>
             When saving a private key, this option specifies the number
             of KDF (key derivation function, currently bcrypt_pbkdf(3))
             rounds used.  Higher numbers result in slower passphrase
             verification and increased resistance to brute-force
             password cracking (should the keys be stolen).  The default
             is 16 rounds.

     <b>-B      </b>Show the bubblebabble digest of specified private or public
             key file.

     <b>-b </b><i>bits</i>
             Specifies the number of bits in the key to create.  For RSA
             keys, the minimum size is 1024 bits and the default is 3072
             bits.  Generally, 3072 bits is considered sufficient.  DSA
             keys must be exactly 1024 bits as specified by FIPS 186-2.
             For ECDSA keys, the <b>-b </b>flag determines the key length by
             selecting from one of three elliptic curve sizes: 256, 384
             or 521 bits.  Attempting to use bit lengths other than
             these three values for ECDSA keys will fail.  ECDSA-SK,
             Ed25519 and Ed25519-SK keys have a fixed length and the <b>-b</b>
             flag will be ignored.

     <b>-C </b><i>comment</i>
             Provides a new comment.

     <b>-c      </b>Requests changing the comment in the private and public key
             files.  The program will prompt for the file containing the
             private keys, for the passphrase if the key has one, and
             for the new comment.

     <b>-D </b><i>pkcs11</i>
             Download the public keys provided by the PKCS#11 shared
             library <i>pkcs11</i>.  When used in combination with <b>-s</b>, this
             option indicates that a CA key resides in a PKCS#11 token
             (see the <i>CERTIFICATES</i> section for details).

     <b>-E </b><i>fingerprint_hash</i>
             Specifies the hash algorithm used when displaying key
             fingerprints.  Valid options are: “md5” and “sha256”.  The
             default is “sha256”.

     <b>-e      </b>This option will read a private or public OpenSSH key file
             and print to stdout a public key in one of the formats
             specified by the <b>-m </b>option.  The default export format is
             “RFC4716”.  This option allows exporting OpenSSH keys for
             use by other programs, including several commercial SSH
             implementations.

     <b>-F </b><i>hostname</i> | <i>[hostname]:port</i>
             Search for the specified <i>hostname</i> (with optional port
             number) in a <i>known_hosts</i> file, listing any occurrences
             found.  This option is useful to find hashed host names or
             addresses and may also be used in conjunction with the <b>-H</b>
             option to print found keys in a hashed format.

     <b>-f </b><i>filename</i>
             Specifies the filename of the key file.

     <b>-g      </b>Use generic DNS format when printing fingerprint resource
             records using the <b>-r </b>command.

     <b>-H      </b>Hash a <i>known_hosts</i> file.  This replaces all hostnames and
             addresses with hashed representations within the specified
             file; the original content is moved to a file with a .old
             suffix.  These hashes may be used normally by <b>ssh </b>and <b>sshd</b>,
             but they do not reveal identifying information should the
             file's contents be disclosed.  This option will not modify
             existing hashed hostnames and is therefore safe to use on
             files that mix hashed and non-hashed names.

     <b>-h      </b>When signing a key, create a host certificate instead of a
             user certificate.  Please see the <i>CERTIFICATES</i> section for
             details.

     <b>-I </b><i>certificate_identity</i>
             Specify the key identity when signing a public key.  Please
             see the <i>CERTIFICATES</i> section for details.

     <b>-i      </b>This option will read an unencrypted private (or public)
             key file in the format specified by the <b>-m </b>option and print
             an OpenSSH compatible private (or public) key to stdout.
             This option allows importing keys from other software,
             including several commercial SSH implementations.  The
             default import format is “RFC4716”.

     <b>-K      </b>Download resident keys from a FIDO authenticator.  Public
             and private key files will be written to the current
             directory for each downloaded key.  If multiple FIDO
             authenticators are attached, keys will be downloaded from
             the first touched authenticator.

     <b>-k      </b>Generate a KRL file.  In this mode, <b>ssh-keygen </b>will
             generate a KRL file at the location specified via the <b>-f</b>
             flag that revokes every key or certificate presented on the
             command line.  Keys/certificates to be revoked may be
             specified by public key file or using the format described
             in the <i>KEY REVOCATION LISTS</i> section.

     <b>-L      </b>Prints the contents of one or more certificates.

     <b>-l      </b>Show fingerprint of specified public key file.  For RSA and
             DSA keys <b>ssh-keygen </b>tries to find the matching public key
             file and prints its fingerprint.  If combined with <b>-v</b>, a
             visual ASCII art representation of the key is supplied with
             the fingerprint.

     <b>-M generate</b>
             Generate candidate Diffie-Hellman Group Exchange (DH-GEX)
             parameters for eventual use by the
             ‘diffie-hellman-group-exchange-*’ key exchange methods.
             The numbers generated by this operation must be further
             screened before use.  See the <i>MODULI GENERATION</i> section for
             more information.

     <b>-M screen</b>
             Screen candidate parameters for Diffie-Hellman Group
             Exchange.  This will accept a list of candidate numbers and
             test that they are safe (Sophie Germain) primes with
             acceptable group generators.  The results of this operation
             may be added to the <i>/etc/moduli</i> file.  See the <i>MODULI</i>
             <i>GENERATION</i> section for more information.

     <b>-m </b><i>key_format</i>
             Specify a key format for key generation, the <b>-i </b>(import),
             <b>-e </b>(export) conversion options, and the <b>-p </b>change
             passphrase operation.  The latter may be used to convert
             between OpenSSH private key and PEM private key formats.
             The supported key formats are: “RFC4716” (RFC 4716/SSH2
             public or private key), “PKCS8” (PKCS8 public or private
             key) or “PEM” (PEM public key).  By default OpenSSH will
             write newly-generated private keys in its own format, but
             when converting public keys for export the default format
             is “RFC4716”.  Setting a format of “PEM” when generating or
             updating a supported private key type will cause the key to
             be stored in the legacy PEM private key format.

     <b>-N </b><i>new_passphrase</i>
             Provides the new passphrase.

     <b>-n </b><i>principals</i>
             Specify one or more principals (user or host names) to be
             included in a certificate when signing a key.  Multiple
             principals may be specified, separated by commas.  Please
             see the <i>CERTIFICATES</i> section for details.

     <b>-O </b><i>option</i>
             Specify a key/value option.  These are specific to the
             operation that <b>ssh-keygen </b>has been requested to perform.

             When signing certificates, one of the options listed in the
             <i>CERTIFICATES</i> section may be specified here.

             When performing moduli generation or screening, one of the
             options listed in the <i>MODULI GENERATION</i> section may be
             specified.

             When generating a key that will be hosted on a FIDO
             authenticator, this flag may be used to specify key-
             specific options.  Those supported at present are:

             <b>application</b>
                     Override the default FIDO application/origin string
                     of “ssh:”.  This may be useful when generating host
                     or domain-specific resident keys.  The specified
                     application string must begin with “ssh:”.

             <b>challenge</b>=<i>path</i>
                     Specifies a path to a challenge string that will be
                     passed to the FIDO token during key generation.
                     The challenge string may be used as part of an out-
                     of-band protocol for key enrollment (a random
                     challenge is used by default).

             <b>device  </b>Explicitly specify a fido(4) device to use, rather
                     than letting the token middleware select one.

             <b>no-touch-required</b>
                     Indicate that the generated private key should not
                     require touch events (user presence) when making
                     signatures.  Note that sshd(8) will refuse such
                     signatures by default, unless overridden via an
                     authorized_keys option.

             <b>resident</b>
                     Indicate that the key should be stored on the FIDO
                     authenticator itself.  Resident keys may be
                     supported on FIDO2 tokens and typically require
                     that a PIN be set on the token prior to generation.
                     Resident keys may be loaded off the token using
                     ssh-add(1).

             <b>user    </b>A username to be associated with a resident key,
                     overriding the empty default username.  Specifying
                     a username may be useful when generating multiple
                     resident keys for the same application name.

             <b>verify-required</b>
                     Indicate that this private key should require user
                     verification for each signature.  Not all FIDO
                     tokens support this option.  Currently PIN
                     authentication is the only supported verification
                     method, but other methods may be supported in the
                     future.

             <b>write-attestation</b>=<i>path</i>
                     May be used at key generation time to record the
                     attestation data returned from FIDO tokens during
                     key generation.  Please note that this information
                     is potentially sensitive.  By default, this
                     information is discarded.

             When performing signature-related options using the <b>-Y</b>
             flag, the following options are accepted:

             <b>print-pubkey</b>
                     Print the full public key to standard output after
                     signature verification.

             <b>verify-time</b>=<i>timestamp</i>
                     Specifies a time to use when validating signatures
                     instead of the current time.  The time may be
                     specified as a date in YYYYMMDD format or a time in
                     YYYYMMDDHHMM[SS] format.

             The <b>-O </b>option may be specified multiple times.

     <b>-P </b><i>passphrase</i>
             Provides the (old) passphrase.

     <b>-p      </b>Requests changing the passphrase of a private key file
             instead of creating a new private key.  The program will
             prompt for the file containing the private key, for the old
             passphrase, and twice for the new passphrase.

     <b>-Q      </b>Test whether keys have been revoked in a KRL.  If the <b>-l</b>
             option is also specified then the contents of the KRL will
             be printed.

     <b>-q      </b>Silence <b>ssh-keygen</b>.

     <b>-R </b><i>hostname</i> | <i>[hostname]:port</i>
             Removes all keys belonging to the specified <i>hostname</i> (with
             optional port number) from a <i>known_hosts</i> file.  This option
             is useful to delete hashed hosts (see the <b>-H </b>option above).

     <b>-r </b><i>hostname</i>
             Print the SSHFP fingerprint resource record named <i>hostname</i>
             for the specified public key file.

     <b>-s </b><i>ca_key</i>
             Certify (sign) a public key using the specified CA key.
             Please see the <i>CERTIFICATES</i> section for details.

             When generating a KRL, <b>-s </b>specifies a path to a CA public
             key file used to revoke certificates directly by key ID or
             serial number.  See the <i>KEY REVOCATION LISTS</i> section for
             details.

     <b>-t dsa </b>| <b>ecdsa </b>| <b>ecdsa-sk </b>| <b>ed25519 </b>| <b>ed25519-sk </b>| <b>rsa</b>
             Specifies the type of key to create.  The possible values
             are “dsa”, “ecdsa”, “ecdsa-sk”, “ed25519”, “ed25519-sk”, or
             “rsa”.

             This flag may also be used to specify the desired signature
             type when signing certificates using an RSA CA key.  The
             available RSA signature variants are “ssh-rsa” (SHA1
             signatures, not recommended), “rsa-sha2-256”, and
             “rsa-sha2-512” (the default).

     <b>-U      </b>When used in combination with <b>-s</b>, this option indicates
             that a CA key resides in a ssh-agent(1).  See the
             <i>CERTIFICATES</i> section for more information.

     <b>-u      </b>Update a KRL.  When specified with <b>-k</b>, keys listed via the
             command line are added to the existing KRL rather than a
             new KRL being created.

     <b>-V </b><i>validity_interval</i>
             Specify a validity interval when signing a certificate.  A
             validity interval may consist of a single time, indicating
             that the certificate is valid beginning now and expiring at
             that time, or may consist of two times separated by a colon
             to indicate an explicit time interval.

             The start time may be specified as the string “always” to
             indicate the certificate has no specified start time, a
             date in YYYYMMDD format, a time in YYYYMMDDHHMM[SS] format,
             a relative time (to the current time) consisting of a minus
             sign followed by an interval in the format described in the
             TIME FORMATS section of sshd_config(5).

             The end time may be specified as a YYYYMMDD date, a
             YYYYMMDDHHMM[SS] time, a relative time starting with a plus
             character or the string “forever” to indicate that the
             certificate has no expiry date.

             For example: “+52w1d” (valid from now to 52 weeks and one
             day from now), “-4w:+4w” (valid from four weeks ago to four
             weeks from now), “20100101123000:20110101123000” (valid
             from 12:30 PM, January 1st, 2010 to 12:30 PM, January 1st,
             2011), “-1d:20110101” (valid from yesterday to midnight,
             January 1st, 2011), “-1m:forever” (valid from one minute
             ago and never expiring).

     <b>-v      </b>Verbose mode.  Causes <b>ssh-keygen </b>to print debugging
             messages about its progress.  This is helpful for debugging
             moduli generation.  Multiple <b>-v </b>options increase the
             verbosity.  The maximum is 3.

     <b>-w </b><i>provider</i>
             Specifies a path to a library that will be used when
             creating FIDO authenticator-hosted keys, overriding the
             default of using the internal USB HID support.

     <b>-Y find-principals</b>
             Find the principal(s) associated with the public key of a
             signature, provided using the <b>-s </b>flag in an authorized
             signers file provided using the <b>-f </b>flag.  The format of the
             allowed signers file is documented in the <i>ALLOWED SIGNERS</i>
             section below.  If one or more matching principals are
             found, they are returned on standard output.

     <b>-Y check-novalidate</b>
             Checks that a signature generated using <b>ssh-keygen -Y sign</b>
             has a valid structure.  This does not validate if a
             signature comes from an authorized signer.  When testing a
             signature, <b>ssh-keygen </b>accepts a message on standard input
             and a signature namespace using <b>-n</b>.  A file containing the
             corresponding signature must also be supplied using the <b>-s</b>
             flag.  Successful testing of the signature is signalled by
             <b>ssh-keygen </b>returning a zero exit status.

     <b>-Y sign</b>
             Cryptographically sign a file or some data using a SSH key.
             When signing, <b>ssh-keygen </b>accepts zero or more files to sign
             on the command-line - if no files are specified then
             <b>ssh-keygen </b>will sign data presented on standard input.
             Signatures are written to the path of the input file with
             “.sig” appended, or to standard output if the message to be
             signed was read from standard input.

             The key used for signing is specified using the <b>-f </b>option
             and may refer to either a private key, or a public key with
             the private half available via ssh-agent(1).  An additional
             signature namespace, used to prevent signature confusion
             across different domains of use (e.g. file signing vs email
             signing) must be provided via the <b>-n </b>flag.  Namespaces are
             arbitrary strings, and may include: “file” for file
             signing, “email” for email signing.  For custom uses, it is
             recommended to use names following a NAMESPACE@YOUR.DOMAIN
             pattern to generate unambiguous namespaces.

     <b>-Y verify</b>
             Request to verify a signature generated using <b>ssh-keygen -Y</b>
             <b>sign </b>as described above.  When verifying a signature,
             <b>ssh-keygen </b>accepts a message on standard input and a
             signature namespace using <b>-n</b>.  A file containing the
             corresponding signature must also be supplied using the <b>-s</b>
             flag, along with the identity of the signer using <b>-I </b>and a
             list of allowed signers via the <b>-f </b>flag.  The format of the
             allowed signers file is documented in the <i>ALLOWED SIGNERS</i>
             section below.  A file containing revoked keys can be
             passed using the <b>-r </b>flag.  The revocation file may be a KRL
             or a one-per-line list of public keys.  Successful
             verification by an authorized signer is signalled by
             <b>ssh-keygen </b>returning a zero exit status.

     <b>-y      </b>This option will read a private OpenSSH format file and
             print an OpenSSH public key to stdout.

     <b>-Z </b><i>cipher</i>
             Specifies the cipher to use for encryption when writing an
             OpenSSH-format private key file.  The list of available
             ciphers may be obtained using "ssh -Q cipher".  The default
             is “aes256-ctr”.

     <b>-z </b><i>serial_number</i>
             Specifies a serial number to be embedded in the certificate
             to distinguish this certificate from others from the same
             CA.  If the <i>serial_number</i> is prefixed with a ‘+’ character,
             then the serial number will be incremented for each
             certificate signed on a single command-line.  The default
             serial number is zero.

             When generating a KRL, the <b>-z </b>flag is used to specify a KRL
             version number.
