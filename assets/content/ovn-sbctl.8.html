       The <b>ovn-sbctl </b>program configures the <b>OVN_Southbound </b>database by
       providing a high-level interface to its configuration database.
       See <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/ovn-sb.5.html">ovn-sb(5)</a> for comprehensive documentation of the database
       schema.

       <b>ovn-sbctl </b>connects to an <b>ovsdb-server </b>process that maintains an
       OVN_Southbound configuration database.  Using this connection, it
       queries and possibly applies changes to the database, depending
       on the supplied commands.

       <b>ovn-sbctl </b>can perform any number of commands in a single run,
       implemented as a single atomic transaction against the database.

       The <b>ovn-sbctl </b>command line begins with global options (see
       <b>OPTIONS </b>below for details).  The global options are followed by
       one or more commands.  Each command should begin with <b>-- </b>by
       itself as a command-line argument, to separate it from the
       following commands.  (The <b>-- </b>before the first command is
       optional.)  The command itself starts with command-specific
       options, if any, followed by the command name and any arguments.
