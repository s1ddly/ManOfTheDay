       Runs a number of housekeeping tasks within the current
       repository, such as compressing file revisions (to reduce disk
       space and increase performance), removing unreachable objects
       which may have been created from prior invocations of <i>git add</i>,
       packing refs, pruning reflog, rerere metadata or stale working
       trees. May also update ancillary indexes such as the
       commit-graph.

       When common porcelain operations that create objects are run,
       they will check whether the repository has grown substantially
       since the last maintenance, and if so run <b>git gc </b>automatically.
       See <b>gc.auto </b>below for how to disable this behavior.

       Running <b>git gc </b>manually should only be needed when adding objects
       to a repository without regularly running such porcelain
       commands, to do a one-off repository optimization, or e.g. to
       clean up a suboptimal mass-import. See the "PACKFILE
       OPTIMIZATION" section in <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/git-fast-import.1.html">git-fast-import(1)</a> for more details on
       the import case.
