       The <i>trace</i> macro package of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/groff.1.html">groff(1)</a> can be a valuable tool for
       debugging documents written in the <i>roff</i> formatting language.  A
       call stack trace is protocolled on standard error, this is, a
       diagnostic message is emitted on entering and exiting of a macro
       call.  This greatly eases to track down an error in some macro.

       This tracing process is activated by specifying the groff or
       troff command-line option <b>-m trace</b>.  A finer control can be
       obtained by including the macro file within the document by the
       groff macro call <b>.mso trace.tmac</b>.  Only macros that are defined
       after this line are traced.

       If the command-line option <b>-r trace-full=1 </b>is given (or if this
       register is set in the document), number and string register
       assignments together with some other requests are traced also.

       If some other macro package should be traced as well it must be
       specified after <b>-m trace </b>on the command line.

       The macro file <b>trace.tmac </b>is unusual because it does not contain
       any macros to be called by a user.  Instead, the existing macro
       definition and appending facilities are modified such that they
       display diagnostic messages.
