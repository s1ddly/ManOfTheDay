       To establish GSS security contexts using these credential files,
       the Linux kernel RPC client depends on a userspace daemon called
       <b>rpc.gssd</b>.  The <b>rpc.gssd </b>daemon uses the rpc_pipefs filesystem to
       communicate with the kernel.

   <b>User Credentials</b>
       When a user authenticates using a command such as <b>kinit</b>(1), the
       resulting credential is stored in a file with a well-known name
       constructed using the user's UID.

       To interact with an NFS server on behalf of a particular
       Kerberos-authenticated user, the Linux kernel RPC client requests
       that <b>rpc.gssd </b>initialize a security context with the credential
       in that user's credential file.

       Typically, credential files are placed in <i>/tmp</i>.  However,
       <b>rpc.gssd </b>can search for credential files in more than one
       directory.  See the description of the <b>-d </b>option for details.

   <b>Machine Credentials</b>
       <b>rpc.gssd </b>searches the default keytab, <i>/etc/krb5.keytab</i>, in the
       following order for a principal and password to use when
       establishing the machine credential.  For the search, rpc.gssd
       replaces &lt;hostname&gt; and &lt;REALM&gt; with the local system's hostname
       and Kerberos realm.

          &lt;HOSTNAME&gt;$@&lt;REALM&gt;
          root/&lt;hostname&gt;@&lt;REALM&gt;
          nfs/&lt;hostname&gt;@&lt;REALM&gt;
          host/&lt;hostname&gt;@&lt;REALM&gt;
          root/&lt;anyname&gt;@&lt;REALM&gt;
          nfs/&lt;anyname&gt;@&lt;REALM&gt;
          host/&lt;anyname&gt;@&lt;REALM&gt;

       rpc.gssd selects one of the &lt;anyname&gt; entries if it does not find
       a service principal matching the local hostname, e.g. if DHCP
       assigns the local hostname dynamically.  The &lt;anyname&gt; facility
       enables the use of the same keytab on multiple systems.  However,
       using the same service principal to establish a machine
       credential on multiple hosts can create unwanted security
       exposures and is therefore not recommended.

       Note that &lt;HOSTNAME&gt;$@&lt;REALM&gt; is a user principal that enables
       Kerberized NFS when the local system is joined to an Active
       Directory domain using Samba.  The keytab provides the password
       for this principal.

       You can specify a different keytab by using the <b>-k </b>option if
       <i>/etc/krb5.keytab</i> does not exist or does not provide one of these
       principals.

   <b>Credentials for UID 0</b>
       UID 0 is a special case.  By default <b>rpc.gssd </b>uses the system's
       machine credentials for UID 0 accesses that require GSS
       authentication.  This limits the privileges of the root user when
       accessing network resources that require authentication.

       Specify the <b>-n </b>option when starting <b>rpc.gssd </b>if you'd like to
       force the root user to obtain a user credential rather than use
       the local system's machine credential.

       When <b>-n </b>is specified, the kernel continues to request a GSS
       context established with a machine credential for NFSv4
       operations, such as SETCLIENTID or RENEW, that manage state.  If
       <b>rpc.gssd </b>cannot obtain a machine credential (say, the local
       system has no keytab), NFSv4 operations that require machine
       credentials will fail.

   <b>Encryption types</b>
       A realm administrator can choose to add keys encoded in a number
       of different encryption types to the local system's keytab.  For
       instance, a host/ principal might have keys for the <b>aes256-cts-</b>
       <b>hmac-sha1-96</b>, <b>aes128-cts-hmac-sha1-96</b>, <b>des3-cbc-sha1</b>, and
       <b>arcfour-hmac </b>encryption types.  This permits <b>rpc.gssd </b>to choose
       an appropriate encryption type that the target NFS server
       supports.

       These encryption types are stronger than legacy single-DES
       encryption types.  To interoperate in environments where servers
       support only weak encryption types, you can restrict your client
       to use only single-DES encryption types by specifying the <b>-l</b>
       option when starting <b>rpc.gssd</b>.
