       The filesystem checker is used to verify structural integrity of
       a filesystem and attempt to repair it if requested. It is
       recommended to unmount the filesystem prior to running the check,
       but it is possible to start checking a mounted filesystem (see
       <i>--force</i>).

       By default, <b>btrfs check </b>will not modify the device but you can
       reaffirm that by the option <i>--readonly</i>.

       <b>btrfsck </b>is an alias of <b>btrfs check </b>command and is now deprecated.

           <b>Warning</b>
           Do not use <i>--repair</i> unless you are advised to do so by a
           developer or an experienced user, and then only after having
           accepted that no <i>fsck</i> successfully repair all types of
           filesystem corruption. Eg. some other software or hardware
           bugs can fatally damage a volume.

       The structural integrity check verifies if internal filesystem
       objects or data structures satisfy the constraints, point to the
       right objects or are correctly connected together.

       There are several cross checks that can detect wrong reference
       counts of shared extents, backreferences, missing extents of
       inodes, directory and inode connectivity etc.

       The amount of memory required can be high, depending on the size
       of the filesystem, similarly the run time. Check the modes that
       can also affect that.
