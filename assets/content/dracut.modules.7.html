       dracut uses a modular system to build and extend the initramfs
       image. All modules are located in <i>/usr/lib/dracut/modules.d</i> or in
       <i>&lt;git-src&gt;/modules.d</i>. The most basic dracut module is <i>99base</i>. In
       <i>99base</i> the initial shell script init is defined, which gets run
       by the kernel after initramfs loading. Although you can replace
       init with your own version of <i>99base</i>, this is not encouraged.
       Instead you should use, if possible, the hooks of dracut. All
       hooks, and the point of time in which they are executed, are
       described in the section called “BOOT PROCESS STAGES”.

       The main script, which creates the initramfs is dracut itself. It
       parses all arguments and sets up the directory, in which
       everything is installed. It then executes all check, install,
       installkernel scripts found in the modules, which are to be
       processed. After everything is installed, the install directory
       is archived and compressed to the final initramfs image. All
       helper functions used by check, install and installkernel are
       found in in the file <i>dracut-functions</i>. These shell functions are
       available to all module installer (install, installkernel)
       scripts, without the need to source <i>dracut-functions</i>.

       A module can check the preconditions for install and
       installkernel with the check script. Also dependencies can be
       expressed with check. If a module passed check, install and
       installkernel will be called to install all of the necessary
       files for the module. To split between kernel and non-kernel
       parts of the installation, all kernel module related parts have
       to be in installkernel. All other files found in a module
       directory are module specific and mostly are hook scripts and
       udev rules.
