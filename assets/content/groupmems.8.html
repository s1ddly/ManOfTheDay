       The <b>groupmems </b>command allows a user to administer their own group
       membership list without the requirement of superuser privileges.
       The <b>groupmems </b>utility is for systems that configure its users to
       be in their own name sake primary group (i.e., guest / guest).

       Only the superuser, as administrator, can use <b>groupmems </b>to alter
       the memberships of other groups.
