       The <b>column </b>utility formats its input into multiple columns. The
       util support three modes:

       <b>columns are filled before rows</b>
           This is the default mode (required by backward
           compatibility).

       <b>rows are filled before columns</b>
           This mode is enabled by option <b>-x, --fillrows</b>

       <b>table</b>
           Determine the number of columns the input contains and create
           a table. This mode is enabled by option <b>-t, --table </b>and
           columns formatting is possible to modify by <b>--table-</b>*
           options. Use this mode if not sure.

       Input is taken from <i>file</i>, or otherwise from standard input. Empty
       lines are ignored and all invalid multibyte sequences are encoded
       by x&lt;hex&gt; convention.
