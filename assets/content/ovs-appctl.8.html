       Open vSwitch daemons accept certain commands at runtime to
       control their behavior and query their settings.  Every daemon
       accepts a common set of commands documented under <b>COMMON COMMANDS</b>
       below.  Some daemons support additional commands documented in
       their own manpages.  <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>in particular accepts a number
       of additional commands documented in <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ovs-vswitchd.8.html">ovs-vswitchd(8)</a>.

       The <b>ovs-appctl </b>program provides a simple way to invoke these
       commands.  The command to be sent is specified on <b>ovs-appctl</b>'s
       command line as non-option arguments.  <b>ovs-appctl </b>sends the
       command and prints the daemon's response on standard output.

       In normal use only a single option is accepted:

       <b>-t </b><i>target</i>
       <b>--target=</b><i>target</i>
              Tells <b>ovs-appctl </b>which daemon to contact.

              If <i>target</i> begins with <b>/ </b>it must name a Unix domain socket
              on which an Open vSwitch daemon is listening for control
              channel connections.  By default, each daemon listens on a
              Unix domain socket named
              <b>/usr/local/var/run/openvswitch/</b><i>program</i><b>.</b><i>pid</i><b>.ctl</b>, where
              <i>program</i> is the program's name and <i>pid</i> is its process ID.
              For example, if <b>ovs-vswitchd </b>has PID 123, it would listen
              on <b>/usr/local/var/run/openvswitch/ovs-vswitchd.123.ctl</b>.

              Otherwise, <b>ovs-appctl </b>looks for a pidfile, that is, a file
              whose contents are the process ID of a running process as
              a decimal number, named
              <b>/usr/local/var/run/openvswitch/</b><i>target</i><b>.pid</b>.  (The <b>--pidfile</b>
              option makes an Open vSwitch daemon create a pidfile.)
              <b>ovs-appctl </b>reads the pidfile, then looks for a Unix socket
              named <b>/usr/local/var/run/openvswitch/</b><i>target</i><b>.</b><i>pid</i><b>.ctl</b>, where
              <i>pid</i> is replaced by the process ID read from the pidfile,
              and uses that file as if it had been specified directly as
              the target.

              On Windows, <i>target</i> can be an absolute path to a file that
              contains a localhost TCP port on which an Open vSwitch
              daemon is listening for control channel connections. By
              default, each daemon writes the TCP port on which it is
              listening for control connection into the file <i>program</i><b>.ctl</b>
              located inside the configured <i>OVS_RUNDIR</i> directory. If
              <i>target</i> is not an absolute path, <b>ovs-appctl </b>looks for a
              file named <i>target</i><b>.ctl </b>in the configured <i>OVS_RUNDIR</i>
              directory.

              The default target is <b>ovs-vswitchd</b>.

       <b>-T </b><i>secs</i>
       <b>--timeout=</b><i>secs</i>
              By default, or with a <i>secs</i> of <b>0</b>, <b>ovs-appctl </b>waits forever
              to connect to the daemon and receive a response.  This
              option limits runtime to approximately <i>secs</i> seconds.  If
              the timeout expires, <b>ovs-appctl </b>exits with a <b>SIGALRM</b>
              signal.
