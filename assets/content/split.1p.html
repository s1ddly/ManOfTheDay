       The <i>split</i> utility shall read an input file and write zero or more
       output files.  The default size of each output file shall be 1000
       lines. The size of the output files can be modified by
       specification of the <b>-b </b>or <b>-l </b>options. Each output file shall be
       created with a unique suffix. The suffix shall consist of exactly
       <i>suffix_length</i> lowercase letters from the POSIX locale. The
       letters of the suffix shall be used as if they were a base-26
       digit system, with the first suffix to be created consisting of
       all <b>'a' </b>characters, the second with a <b>'b' </b>replacing the last <b>'a'</b>,
       and so on, until a name of all <b>'z' </b>characters is created. By
       default, the names of the output files shall be <b>'x'</b>, followed by
       a two-character suffix from the character set as described above,
       starting with <b>"aa"</b>, <b>"ab"</b>, <b>"ac"</b>, and so on, and continuing until
       the suffix <b>"zz"</b>, for a maximum of 676 files.

       If the number of files required exceeds the maximum allowed by
       the suffix length provided, such that the last allowable file
       would be larger than the requested size, the <i>split</i> utility shall
       fail after creating the last file with a valid suffix; <i>split</i>
       shall not delete the files it created with valid suffixes. If the
       file limit is not exceeded, the last file created shall contain
       the remainder of the input file, and may be smaller than the
       requested size. If the input is an empty file, no output file
       shall be created and this shall not be considered to be an error.
