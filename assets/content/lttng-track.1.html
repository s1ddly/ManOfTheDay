<pre>
       The <b>lttng track </b>commands adds one or more entries to a resource
       tracker.

       A resource tracker is a <i>whitelist</i> of resources. Tracked resources
       are allowed to emit events, provided those events are targeted by
       enabled event rules (see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/lttng-enable-event.1.html">lttng-enable-event(1)</a>).

       Tracker entries can be removed from the whitelist with
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/lttng-untrack.1.html">lttng-untrack(1)</a>.

       As of this version, the only available tracker is the <b>PID</b>
       <b>tracker</b>. The process ID (PID) tracker follows one or more process
       IDs; only the processes with a tracked PID are allowed to emit
       events. By default, all possible PIDs on the system are tracked:
       any process may emit enabled events (equivalent of <b>lttng track</b>
       <b>--pid --all </b>for all domains).

       With the PID tracker, it is possible, for example, to record all
       system calls called by a given process:

           # lttng enable-event --kernel --all --syscall
           # lttng track --kernel --pid=2345
           # lttng start

       If all the PIDs are tracked (i.e. <b>lttng track --pid --all</b>, which
       is the default state of all domains when creating a tracing
       session), then using the track command with one or more specific
       PIDs has the effect of first removing all the PIDs from the
       whitelist, then adding the specified PIDs.

   <b>Example</b>
       Assume the maximum system PID is 7 for this example.

       Initial whitelist:

           [0] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7]

       Command:

           $ lttng track --userspace --pid=3,6,7

       Whitelist:

           [ ] [ ] [ ] [3] [ ] [ ] [6] [7]

       Command:

           $ lttng untrack --userspace --pid=7

       Whitelist:

           [ ] [ ] [ ] [3] [ ] [ ] [6] [ ]

       Command:

           $ lttng track --userspace --pid=1,5

       Whitelist:

           [ ] [1] [ ] [3] [ ] [5] [6] [ ]

       It should be noted that the PID tracker tracks the numeric
       process IDs. Should a process with a given ID exit and another
       process be given this ID, then the latter would also be allowed
       to emit events.

       See the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/lttng-untrack.1.html">lttng-untrack(1)</a> for more details about removing entries.
