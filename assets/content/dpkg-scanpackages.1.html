       <b>dpkg-scanpackages </b>sorts through a tree of Debian binary packages
       and creates a Packages file, used by <b>apt</b>(8), <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dselect.1.html">dselect(1)</a>, etc, to
       tell the user what packages are available for installation. These
       Packages files are the same as those found on Debian archive
       sites and CD-ROMs. You might use <b>dpkg-scanpackages </b>yourself if
       making a directory of local packages to install on a cluster of
       machines.

       <b>Note: </b>If you want to access the generated Packages file with <b>apt</b>
       you will probably need to compress the file with <b>xz</b>(1)
       (generating a Packages.xz file), <b>bzip2</b>(1) (generating a
       Packages.bz2 file) or <b>gzip</b>(1) (generating a Packages.gz file).
       apt ignores uncompressed Packages files except on local access
       (i.e.  <b>file:// </b>sources).

       <i>binary-path</i> is the name of the tree of the binary packages to
       process (for example, <b>contrib/binary-i386</b>).  It is best to make
       this relative to the root of the Debian archive, because every
       Filename field in the new Packages file will start with this
       string.

       <i>override-file</i> is the name of a file to read which contains
       information about how the package fits into the distribution (the
       file can be compressed since dpkg 1.15.5); see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/deb-override.5.html">deb-override(5)</a>.

       <i>path-prefix</i> is an optional string to be prepended to the Filename
       fields.

       If more than one version of a package is found only the newest
       one is included in the output. If they have the same version and
       only differ in architecture only the first one found is used.
