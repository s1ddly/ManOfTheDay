       systemd-run-generator is a generator that reads the kernel
       command line and understands three options:

       If the <b>systemd.run= </b>option is specified and followed by a command
       line, a unit named kernel-command-line.service is generated for
       it and booted into. The service has <i>Type=oneshot</i> set, and has
       <i>SuccessAction=exit</i> and <i>FailureAction=exit</i> configured by default,
       thus ensuring that the system is shut down as soon as the command
       completes. The exit status of the command line is propagated to
       the invoking container manager, if this applies (which might
       propagate this further, to the calling shell â€” e.g.
       <b>systemd-nspawn</b>(7) does this). If this option is used multiple
       times the unit file will contain multiple <i>ExecStart=</i> lines, to
       execute all commands in order. The command is started as regular
       service, i.e. with <i>DefaultDependencies=</i> on.

       Use <b>systemd.run_success_action= </b>and <b>systemd.run_failure_action=</b>
       to tweak how to react to the process completing. In particular
       assigning "none" will leave the system running after the command
       completes. For further details on supported arguments, see
