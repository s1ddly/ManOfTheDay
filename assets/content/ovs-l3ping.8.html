       The <b>ovs-l3ping </b>program may be used to check for problems that
       could be caused by invalid routing policy, misconfigured firewall
       in the tunnel path or a bad NIC driver.  On one of the nodes, run
       <b>ovs-l3ping </b>in server mode and on the other node run it in client
       mode.  The client and server will establish L3 tunnel, over which
       client will give further testing instructions. The <b>ovs-l3ping</b>
       client will perform UDP and TCP tests.  This tool is different
       from <b>ovs-test </b>that it encapsulates XML/RPC control connection
       over the tunnel, so there is no need to open special holes in
       firewall.

       UDP tests can report packet loss and achieved bandwidth for
       various datagram sizes. By default target bandwidth for UDP tests
       is 1Mbit/s.

       TCP tests report only achieved bandwidth, because kernel TCP
       stack takes care of flow control and packet loss.

   <b>Client Mode</b>
       An <b>ovs-l3ping </b>client will create a L3 tunnel and connect over it
       to the <b>ovs-l3ping </b>server to schedule the tests. <i>TunnelRemoteIP</i> is
       the peer's IP address, where tunnel will be terminated. <i>InnerIP</i>
       is the address that will be temporarily assigned during testing.
       All test traffic originating from this IP address to the
       <i>RemoteInnerIP</i> will be tunneled.  It is possible to override
       default <i>ControlPort</i> and <i>DataPort</i>, if there is any other
       application that already listens on those two ports.

   <b>Server Mode</b>
       To conduct tests, <b>ovs-l3ping </b>server must be running.  It is
       required that both client and server <i>InnerIP</i> addresses are in the
       same subnet.  It is possible to specify <i>InnerIP</i> with netmask in
       CIDR format.
