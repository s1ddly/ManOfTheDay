       blktrace is a block layer IO tracing mechanism which provides
       detailed information about request queue operations up to user
       space. There are three major components: a kernel component, a
       utility to record the i/o trace information for the kernel to
       user space, and utilities to analyse and view the trace
       information.  This man page describes blktrace, which records the
       i/o event trace information for a specific block device to a
       file.

       The <b>blktrace </b>utility extracts event traces from the kernel (via
       the relaying through the debug file system). Some background
       details concerning the run-time behaviour of blktrace will help
       to understand some of the more arcane command line options:

       - blktrace receives data from the kernel in buffers passed up
         through the debug file system (relay). Each device being traced
         has a file created in the mounted directory for the debugfs,
         which defaults to <i>/sys/kernel/debug</i> -- this can be overridden
         with the <b>-r </b>command line argument.

       - blktrace defaults to collecting all events that can be traced.
         To limit the events being captured, you can specify one or more
         filter masks via the <b>-a </b>option.

         Alternatively, one may specify the entire mask utilising a
         hexadecimal value that is version-specific. (Requires
         understanding of the internal representation of the filter
         mask.)

       - As noted above, the events are passed up via a series of
         buffers stored into debugfs files. The size and number of
         buffers can be specified via the <b>-b </b>and <b>-n </b>arguments
         respectively.

       - blktrace stores the extracted data into files stored in the
         local directory. The format of the file names is (by default)
         <b>device</b>.<b>blktrace</b>.<b>cpu</b>, where <b>device </b>is the base device name (e.g,
         if we are tracing /dev/sda, the base device name would be <b>sda</b>);
         and <b>cpu </b>identifies a CPU for the event stream.

         The <b>device </b>portion of the event file name can be changed via
         the <b>-o </b>option.

       - blktrace may also be run concurrently with blkparse to produce
         <b>live </b>output -- to do this specify <b>-o - </b>for blktrace.

       - The default behaviour for blktrace is to run forever until
         explicitly killed by the user (via a control-C, or sending
         SIGINT signal to the process via invocation the kill (1)
         utility). Also you can specify a run-time duration for blktrace
         via the <b>-w </b>option -- then blktrace will run for the specified
         number of seconds, and then halt.
