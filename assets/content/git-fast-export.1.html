       This program dumps the given revisions in a form suitable to be
       piped into <i>git fast-import</i>.

       You can use it as a human-readable bundle replacement (see
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/git-bundle.1.html">git-bundle(1)</a>), or as a format that can be edited before being
       fed to <i>git fast-import</i> in order to do history rewrites (an
       ability relied on by tools like <i>git filter-repo</i>).
