       The <i>more</i> utility shall read files and either write them to the
       terminal on a page-by-page basis or filter them to standard
       output. If standard output is not a terminal device, all input
       files shall be copied to standard output in their entirety,
       without modification, except as specified for the <b>-s </b>option. If
       standard output is a terminal device, the files shall be written
       a number of lines (one screenful) at a time under the control of
       user commands. See the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section.

       Certain block-mode terminals do not have all the capabilities
       necessary to support the complete <i>more</i> definition; they are
       incapable of accepting commands that are not terminated with a
       &lt;newline&gt;.  Implementations that support such terminals shall
       provide an operating mode to <i>more</i> in which all commands can be
       terminated with a &lt;newline&gt; on those terminals. This mode:

        *  Shall be documented in the system documentation

        *  Shall, at invocation, inform the user of the terminal
           deficiency that requires the &lt;newline&gt; usage and provide
           instructions on how this warning can be suppressed in future
           invocations

        *  Shall not be required for implementations supporting only
           fully capable terminals

        *  Shall not affect commands already requiring &lt;newline&gt;
           characters

        *  Shall not affect users on the capable terminals from using
           <i>more</i> as described in this volume of POSIX.1‚Äê2017
