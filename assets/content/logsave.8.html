       The <b>logsave </b>program will execute <i>cmd_prog</i> with the specified
       argument(s), and save a copy of its output to <i>logfile</i>.  If the
       containing directory for <i>logfile</i> does not exist, <b>logsave </b>will
       accumulate the output in memory until it can be written out.  A
       copy of the output will also be written to standard output.

       If <i>cmd_prog</i> is a single hyphen ('-'), then instead of executing a
       program, <b>logsave </b>will take its input from standard input and save
       it in <i>logfile</i>

       <b>logsave </b>is useful for saving the output of initial boot scripts
       until the /var partition is mounted, so the output can be written
       to /var/log.
