<pre>
       The <b>look </b>utility displays any lines in <i>file</i> which contain <i>string</i>.
       As <b>look </b>performs a binary search, the lines in <i>file</i> must be
       sorted (where <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/sort.1.html">sort(1)</a> was given the same options <b>-d </b>and/or <b>-f</b>
       that <b>look </b>is invoked with).

       If <i>file</i> is not specified, the file <i>/usr/share/dict/words</i> is used,
       only alphanumeric characters are compared and the case of
       alphabetic characters is ignored.
