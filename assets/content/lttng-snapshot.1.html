       The <b>lttng snapshot </b>command manages the snapshot outputs and takes
       snapshots.

       A <i>snapshot</i> is a dump of the current sub-buffers of all the
       channels of a given tracing session. When a snapshot is taken,
       the memory dump is sent to the registered snapshot outputs.

       The tracing session should be created in <i>snapshot mode</i> to make
       sure taking snapshots is allowed. This is done at tracing session
       creation time using the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/lttng-create.1.html">lttng-create(1)</a> command.

       Note that, when a snapshot is taken, the sub-buffers are not
       cleared. This means that different recorded snapshots may contain
       the same events.

   <b>Snapshot outputs</b>
       Snapshot outputs are the destinations of snapshot files when a
       snapshot is taken using the <b>record </b>action.

       As of this version, only one snapshot output is allowed.

       A snapshot output can be added using the <b>add-output </b>action. The
       output destination URL is set using either the <i>URL</i> positional
       argument, or both the <b>--ctrl-url </b>and <b>--data-url </b>options. See
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/lttng-create.1.html">lttng-create(1)</a> to learn more about the URL format.

       A name can be assigned to an output when adding it using the
       <b>--name </b>option. This name is part of the names of the snapshot
       files written to this output.

       By default, the snapshot files can be as big as the sum of the
       sizes of all the sub-buffers or all the channels of the selected
       tracing session. The maximum total size of all the snapshot files
       can be configured using the <b>--max-size </b>option.

       Snapshot outputs can be listed using the <b>list-output </b>action.

       Snapshot outputs can be removed using the <b>del-output </b>action. The
       configured name can be used when removing an output, or an ID as
       listed by the <b>list-output </b>action.

   <b>Taking a snapshot</b>
       Taking a snapshot of the current tracing session is as easy as:

           $ lttng snapshot record

       This writes the snapshot files to the configured output. It is
       possible to use a custom, unregistered output at record time
       using the same options supported by the <b>add-output </b>action.

           <b>Note</b>
           Before taking a snapshot on a system with a high event
           throughput, it is recommended to first run <b>lttng stop </b>(see
           <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/lttng-stop.1.html">lttng-stop(1)</a>). Otherwise, the snapshot could contain
           "holes", the result of the tracers overwriting unconsumed
           trace packets during the record operation. After the snapshot
           is recorded, the tracers can be started again with <b>lttng</b>
           <b>start </b>(see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/lttng-start.1.html">lttng-start(1)</a>).
