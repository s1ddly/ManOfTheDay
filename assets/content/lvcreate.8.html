       lvcreate creates a new LV in a VG. For standard LVs, this
       requires allocating logical extents from the VG's free physical
       extents. If there is not enough free space, the VG can be
       extended with other PVs (<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/vgextend.8.html">vgextend(8)</a>), or existing LVs can be
       reduced or removed (<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/lvremove.8.html">lvremove(8)</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/lvreduce.8.html">lvreduce(8)</a>).

       To control which PVs a new LV will use, specify one or more PVs
       as position args at the end of the command line. lvcreate will
       allocate physical extents only from the specified PVs.

       lvcreate can also create snapshots of existing LVs, e.g. for
       backup purposes. The data in a new snapshot LV represents the
       content of the original LV from the time the snapshot was
       created.

       RAID LVs can be created by specifying an LV type when creating
       the LV (see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/lvmraid.7.html">lvmraid(7)</a>). Different RAID levels require different
       numbers of unique PVs be available in the VG for allocation.

       Thin pools (for thin provisioning) and cache pools (for caching)
       are represented by special LVs with types thin-pool and
       cache-pool (see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/lvmthin.7.html">lvmthin(7)</a> and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/lvmcache.7.html">lvmcache(7)</a>). The pool LVs are not
       usable as standard block devices, but the LV names act as
       references to the pools.

       Thin LVs are thinly provisioned from a thin pool, and are created
       with a virtual size rather than a physical size. A cache LV is
       the combination of a standard LV with a cache pool, used to cache
       active portions of the LV to improve performance.

       VDO LVs are also provisioned volumes from a VDO pool, and are
       created with a virtual size rather than a physical size (see
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/lvmvdo.7.html">lvmvdo(7)</a>).

   <b>Usage notes</b>
       In the usage section below, <b>--size </b><i>Size</i> can be replaced with
       <b>--extents </b><i>Number</i>. See descriptions in the options section.

       In the usage section below, <b>--name </b>is omitted from the required
       options, even though it is typically used. When the name is not
       specified, a new LV name is generated with the "lvol" prefix and
       a unique numeric suffix.

       In the usage section below, when creating a pool and the name is
       omitted the new LV pool name is generated with the "vpool" for
       vdo-pools  for prefix and a unique numeric suffix.

       Pool name can be specified together with <i>VG</i> name i.e.:
       vg00/mythinpool.
