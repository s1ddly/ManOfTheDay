       <b>localectl </b>may be used to query and change the system locale and
       keyboard layout settings. It communicates with <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/systemd-localed.8.html">systemd-localed(8)</a>
       to modify files such as /etc/locale.conf and /etc/vconsole.conf.

       The system locale controls the language settings of system
       services and of the UI before the user logs in, such as the
       display manager, as well as the default for users after login.

       The keyboard settings control the keyboard layout used on the
       text console and of the graphical UI before the user logs in,
       such as the display manager, as well as the default for users
       after login.

       Note that the changes performed using this tool might require the
       initramfs to be rebuilt to take effect during early system boot.
       The initramfs is not rebuilt automatically by localectl.

       Note that <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/systemd-firstboot.1.html">systemd-firstboot(1)</a> may be used to initialize the
       system locale for mounted (but not booted) system images.
