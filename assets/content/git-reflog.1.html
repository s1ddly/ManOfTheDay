       The command takes various subcommands, and different options
       depending on the subcommand:

           <i>git reflog</i> [<i>show</i>] [log-options] [&lt;ref&gt;]
           <i>git reflog expire</i> [--expire=&lt;time&gt;] [--expire-unreachable=&lt;time&gt;]
                   [--rewrite] [--updateref] [--stale-fix]
                   [--dry-run | -n] [--verbose] [--all [--single-worktree] | &lt;refs&gt;...]
           <i>git reflog delete</i> [--rewrite] [--updateref]
                   [--dry-run | -n] [--verbose] ref@{specifier}...
           <i>git reflog exists</i> &lt;ref&gt;

       Reference logs, or "reflogs", record when the tips of branches
       and other references were updated in the local repository.
       Reflogs are useful in various Git commands, to specify the old
       value of a reference. For example, <b>HEAD@{2} </b>means "where HEAD
       used to be two moves ago", <b>master@{one.week.ago} </b>means "where
       master used to point to one week ago in this local repository",
       and so on. See <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/gitrevisions.7.html">gitrevisions(7)</a> for more details.

       This command manages the information recorded in the reflogs.

       The "show" subcommand (which is also the default, in the absence
       of any subcommands) shows the log of the reference provided in
       the command-line (or <b>HEAD</b>, by default). The reflog covers all
       recent actions, and in addition the <b>HEAD </b>reflog records branch
       switching. <b>git reflog show </b>is an alias for <b>git log -g</b>
       <b>--abbrev-commit --pretty=oneline</b>; see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/git-log.1.html">git-log(1)</a> for more
       information.

       The "expire" subcommand prunes older reflog entries. Entries
       older than <b>expire </b>time, or entries older than <b>expire-unreachable</b>
       time and not reachable from the current tip, are removed from the
       reflog. This is typically not used directly by end users â€”
       instead, see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/git-gc.1.html">git-gc(1)</a>.

       The "delete" subcommand deletes single entries from the reflog.
       Its argument must be an <i>exact</i> entry (e.g. "<b>git reflog delete</b>
       <b>master@{2}</b>"). This subcommand is also typically not used directly
       by end users.

       The "exists" subcommand checks whether a ref has a reflog. It
       exits with zero status if the reflog exists, and non-zero status
       if it does not.
