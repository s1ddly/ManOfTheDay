       <b>pam_systemd </b>registers user sessions with the systemd login
       manager <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/systemd-logind.service.8.html">systemd-logind.service(8)</a>, and hence the systemd control
       group hierarchy.

       The module also applies various resource management and runtime
       parameters to the new session, as configured in the <b>JSON User</b>
       <b>Records</b><b></b>[1] of the user, when one is defined.

       On login, this module — in conjunction with
       systemd-logind.service — ensures the following:

        1. If it does not exist yet, the user runtime directory
           /run/user/$UID is either created or mounted as new "tmpfs"
           file system with quota applied, and its ownership changed to
           the user that is logging in.

        2. The <i>$XDG_SESSION_ID</i> environment variable is initialized. If
           auditing is available and <b>pam_loginuid.so </b>was run before this
           module (which is highly recommended), the variable is
           initialized from the auditing session id
           (/proc/self/sessionid). Otherwise, an independent session
           counter is used.

        3. A new systemd scope unit is created for the session. If this
           is the first concurrent session of the user, an implicit
           per-user slice unit below user.slice is automatically created
           and the scope placed into it. An instance of the system
           service user@.service, which runs the systemd user manager
           instance, is started.

        4. The "$TZ", "$EMAIL" and "$LANG" environment variables are
           configured for the user, based on the respective data from
           the user's JSON record (if it is defined). Moreover, any
           environment variables explicitly configured in the user
           record are imported, and the umask, nice level, and resource
           limits initialized.

       On logout, this module ensures the following:

        1. If enabled in <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/logind.conf.5.html">logind.conf(5)</a> (<i>KillUserProcesses=</i>), all
           processes of the session are terminated. If the last
           concurrent session of a user ends, the user's systemd
           instance will be terminated too, and so will the user's slice
           unit.

        2. If the last concurrent session of a user ends, the user
           runtime directory /run/user/$UID and all its contents are
           removed, too.

       If the system was not booted up with systemd as init system, this
       module does nothing and immediately returns <b>PAM_SUCCESS</b>.
