       <b>sfdisk </b>is a script-oriented tool for partitioning any block
       device. It runs in interactive mode if executed on a terminal
       (stdin refers to a terminal).

       Since version 2.26 <b>sfdisk </b>supports MBR (DOS), GPT, SUN and SGI
       disk labels, but no longer provides any functionality for CHS
       (Cylinder-Head-Sector) addressing. CHS has never been important
       for Linux, and this addressing concept does not make any sense
       for new devices.

       <b>sfdisk </b>protects the first disk sector when create a new disk
       label. The option <b>--wipe always </b>disables this protection. Note
       that <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/fdisk.8.html">fdisk(8)</a> and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/cfdisk.8.html">cfdisk(8)</a> completely erase this area by
       default.

       <b>sfdisk </b>(since version 2.26) <b>aligns the start and end of</b>
       <b>partitions </b>to block-device I/O limits when relative sizes are
       specified, when the default values are used or when
       multiplicative suffixes (e.g., MiB) are used for sizes. It is
       possible that partition size will be optimized (reduced or
       enlarged) due to alignment if the start offset is specified
       exactly in sectors and partition size relative or by
       multiplicative suffixes.

       The recommended way is not to specify start offsets at all and
       specify partition size in MiB, GiB (or so). In this case <b>sfdisk</b>
       aligns all partitions to block-device I/O limits (or when I/O
       limits are too small then to megabyte boundary to keep disk
       layout portable). If this default behaviour is unwanted (usually
       for very small partitions) then specify offsets and sizes in
       sectors. In this case <b>sfdisk </b>entirely follows specified numbers
       without any optimization.

       <b>sfdisk </b>does not create the standard system partitions for SGI and
       SUN disk labels like <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/fdisk.8.html">fdisk(8)</a> does. It is necessary to explicitly
       create all partitions including whole-disk system partitions.

       <b>sfdisk </b>uses <b>BLKRRPART </b>(reread partition table) ioctl to make sure
       that the device is not used by system or other tools (see also
       <b>--no-reread</b>). Itâ€™s possible that this feature or another <b>sfdisk</b>
       activity races with <b>udevd</b>. The recommended way how to avoid
       possible collisions is to use <b>--lock </b>option. The exclusive lock
       will cause udevd to skip the event handling on the device.

       The <b>sfdisk </b>prompt is only a hint for users and a displayed
       partition number does not mean that the same partition table
       entry will be created (if <b>-N </b>not specified), especially for
       tables with gaps.
