       This manual page documents the GNU version of <b>updatedb</b>, which
       updates file name databases used by GNU <b>locate</b>.  The file name
       databases contain lists of files that were in particular
       directory trees when the databases were last updated.  The file
       name of the default database is determined when <b>locate </b>and
       <b>updatedb </b>are configured and installed.  The frequency with which
       the databases are updated and the directories for which they
       contain entries depend on how often <b>updatedb </b>is run, and with
       which arguments.

       In networked environments, it often makes sense to build a
       database at the root of each filesystem, containing the entries
       for that filesystem.  <b>updatedb </b>is then run for each filesystem on
       the fileserver where that filesystem is on a local disk, to
       prevent thrashing the network.  Users can select which databases
       <b>locate </b>searches using an environment variable or command line
       option; see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/locate.1.html">locate(1)</a>.  Databases cannot be concatenated
       together.

       The <b>LOCATGE02 </b>database format was introduced in GNU findutils
       version 4.0 in order to allow machines with different byte
       orderings to share the databases.  GNU <b>locate </b>can read both the
       old and <b>LOCATE02 </b>database formats, though support for the old
       pre-4.0 database format will be removed shortly.
