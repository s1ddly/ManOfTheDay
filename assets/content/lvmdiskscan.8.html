       lvmdiskscan scans all SCSI, (E)IDE disks, multiple devices and a
       bunch of other block devices in the system looking for LVM PVs.
       The size reported is the real device size. Define a filter in
       <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/lvm.conf.5.html">lvm.conf(5)</a> to restrict the scan to avoid a CD ROM, for example.

       This command is deprecated, use <b>pvs </b>instead.
