       It traces the network path to <i>destination</i> discovering MTU along
       this path. It uses UDP port <i>port</i> or some random port. It is
       similar to <b>traceroute</b>. However, it does not require superuser
       privileges and has no fancy options.

       <b>tracepath -6 </b>is a good replacement for <b>traceroute6 </b>and classic
       example of application of Linux error queues. The situation with
       IPv4 is worse, because commercial IP routers do not return enough
       information in ICMP error messages. Probably, it will change,
       when they are updated. For now it uses Van Jacobson's trick,
       sweeping a range of UDP ports to maintain trace history.
