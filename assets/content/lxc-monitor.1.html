       <b>lxc-monitor </b>monitors the state of containers. The <i>name</i> argument
       may be used to specify which containers to monitor. It is a
       regular expression, conforming with posix2, so it is possible to
       monitor all the containers, several of them or just one. If not
       specified, <i>name</i> will default to '.*' which will monitor all
       containers in <b>lxcpath</b>.

       The <b>-P, --lxcpath</b>=PATH option may be specified multiple times to
       monitor more than one container path. Note however that
       containers with the same name in multiple paths will be
       indistinguishable in the output.
