<pre>

       A pattern may be followed by any number of modifiers, which are
       mostly single characters, though some of these can be qualified
       by further characters.  Following Perl usage, these are referred
       to below as, for example, "the <b>/i </b>modifier", even though the
       delimiter of the pattern need not always be a slash, and no slash
       is used when writing modifiers. White space may appear between
       the final pattern delimiter and the first modifier, and between
       the modifiers themselves. For reference, here is a complete list
       of modifiers. They fall into several groups that are described in
       detail in the following sections.

         <b>/8              </b>set UTF mode
         <b>/9              </b>set PCRE_NEVER_UTF (locks out UTF mode)
         <b>/?              </b>disable UTF validity check
         <b>/+              </b>show remainder of subject after match
         <b>/=              </b>show all captures (not just those that are set)

         <b>/A              </b>set PCRE_ANCHORED
         <b>/B              </b>show compiled code
         <b>/C              </b>set PCRE_AUTO_CALLOUT
         <b>/D              </b>same as <b>/B </b>plus <b>/I</b>
         <b>/E              </b>set PCRE_DOLLAR_ENDONLY
         <b>/F              </b>flip byte order in compiled pattern

         <b>/J              </b>set PCRE_DUPNAMES
         <b>/K              </b>show backtracking control names
         <b>/L              </b>set locale
         <b>/M              </b>show compiled memory size
         <b>/m              </b>set PCRE_MULTILINE
         <b>/N              </b>set PCRE_NO_AUTO_CAPTURE
         <b>/O              </b>set PCRE_NO_AUTO_POSSESS
         <b>/P              </b>use the POSIX wrapper
         <b>/Q              </b>test external stack check function
         <b>/S              </b>study the pattern after compilation
         <b>/s              </b>set PCRE_DOTALL
         <b>/T              </b>select character tables

         <b>/X              </b>set PCRE_EXTRA
         <b>/x              </b>set PCRE_EXTENDED
         <b>/Y              </b>set PCRE_NO_START_OPTIMIZE
         <b>/Z              </b>don't show lengths in <b>/B </b>output

         <b>/&lt;any&gt;          </b>set PCRE_NEWLINE_ANY
         <b>/&lt;anycrlf&gt;      </b>set PCRE_NEWLINE_ANYCRLF
         <b>/&lt;cr&gt;           </b>set PCRE_NEWLINE_CR
         <b>/&lt;crlf&gt;         </b>set PCRE_NEWLINE_CRLF
         <b>/&lt;lf&gt;           </b>set PCRE_NEWLINE_LF
         <b>/&lt;bsr_anycrlf&gt;  </b>set PCRE_BSR_ANYCRLF
         <b>/&lt;bsr_unicode&gt;  </b>set PCRE_BSR_UNICODE
         <b>/&lt;JS&gt;           </b>set PCRE_JAVASCRIPT_COMPAT

   <b>Perl-compatible modifiers</b>

       The <b>/i</b>, <b>/m</b>, <b>/s</b>, and <b>/x </b>modifiers set the PCRE_CASELESS,
       PCRE_MULTILINE, PCRE_DOTALL, or PCRE_EXTENDED options,
       respectively, when <b>pcre[16|32]_compile() </b>is called. These four
       modifier letters have the same effect as they do in Perl. For
       example:

         /caseless/i

   <b>Modifiers for other PCRE options</b>

       The following table shows additional modifiers for setting PCRE
       compile-time options that do not correspond to anything in Perl:

         <b>/8              </b>PCRE_UTF8           ) when using the 8-bit
         <b>/?              </b>PCRE_NO_UTF8_CHECK  )   library

         <b>/8              </b>PCRE_UTF16          ) when using the 16-bit
         <b>/?              </b>PCRE_NO_UTF16_CHECK )   library

         <b>/8              </b>PCRE_UTF32          ) when using the 32-bit
         <b>/?              </b>PCRE_NO_UTF32_CHECK )   library

         <b>/9              </b>PCRE_NEVER_UTF
         <b>/A              </b>PCRE_ANCHORED
         <b>/C              </b>PCRE_AUTO_CALLOUT
         <b>/E              </b>PCRE_DOLLAR_ENDONLY
         <b>/f              </b>PCRE_FIRSTLINE
         <b>/J              </b>PCRE_DUPNAMES
         <b>/N              </b>PCRE_NO_AUTO_CAPTURE
         <b>/O              </b>PCRE_NO_AUTO_POSSESS
         <b>/U              </b>PCRE_UNGREEDY
         <b>/W              </b>PCRE_UCP
         <b>/X              </b>PCRE_EXTRA
         <b>/Y              </b>PCRE_NO_START_OPTIMIZE
         <b>/&lt;any&gt;          </b>PCRE_NEWLINE_ANY
         <b>/&lt;anycrlf&gt;      </b>PCRE_NEWLINE_ANYCRLF
         <b>/&lt;cr&gt;           </b>PCRE_NEWLINE_CR
         <b>/&lt;crlf&gt;         </b>PCRE_NEWLINE_CRLF
         <b>/&lt;lf&gt;           </b>PCRE_NEWLINE_LF
         <b>/&lt;bsr_anycrlf&gt;  </b>PCRE_BSR_ANYCRLF
         <b>/&lt;bsr_unicode&gt;  </b>PCRE_BSR_UNICODE
         <b>/&lt;JS&gt;           </b>PCRE_JAVASCRIPT_COMPAT

       The modifiers that are enclosed in angle brackets are literal
       strings as shown, including the angle brackets, but the letters
       within can be in either case.  This example sets multiline
       matching with CRLF as the line ending sequence:

         /^abc/m&lt;CRLF&gt;

       As well as turning on the PCRE_UTF8/16/32 option, the <b>/8 </b>modifier
       causes all non-printing characters in output strings to be
       printed using the \x{hh...} notation. Otherwise, those less than
       0x100 are output in hex without the curly brackets.

       Full details of the PCRE options are given in the <b>pcreapi</b>
       documentation.

   <b>Finding all matches in a string</b>

       Searching for all possible matches within each subject string can
       be requested by the <b>/g </b>or <b>/G </b>modifier. After finding a match,
       PCRE is called again to search the remainder of the subject
       string. The difference between <b>/g </b>and <b>/G </b>is that the former uses
       the <i>startoffset</i> argument to <b>pcre[16|32]_exec() </b>to start searching
       at a new point within the entire string (which is in effect what
       Perl does), whereas the latter passes over a shortened substring.
       This makes a difference to the matching process if the pattern
       begins with a lookbehind assertion (including \b or \B).

       If any call to <b>pcre[16|32]_exec() </b>in a <b>/g </b>or <b>/G </b>sequence matches
       an empty string, the next call is done with the
       PCRE_NOTEMPTY_ATSTART and PCRE_ANCHORED flags set in order to
       search for another, non-empty, match at the same point. If this
       second match fails, the start offset is advanced, and the normal
       match is retried. This imitates the way Perl handles such cases
       when using the <b>/g </b>modifier or the <b>split() </b>function. Normally, the
       start offset is advanced by one character, but if the newline
       convention recognizes CRLF as a newline, and the current
       character is CR followed by LF, an advance of two is used.

   <b>Other modifiers</b>

       There are yet more modifiers for controlling the way <b>pcretest</b>
       operates.

       The <b>/+ </b>modifier requests that as well as outputting the substring
       that matched the entire pattern, <b>pcretest </b>should in addition
       output the remainder of the subject string. This is useful for
       tests where the subject contains multiple copies of the same
       substring. If the <b>+ </b>modifier appears twice, the same action is
       taken for captured substrings. In each case the remainder is
       output on the following line with a plus character following the
       capture number. Note that this modifier must not immediately
       follow the /S modifier because /S+ and /S++ have other meanings.

       The <b>/= </b>modifier requests that the values of all potential
       captured parentheses be output after a match. By default, only
       those up to the highest one actually used in the match are output
       (corresponding to the return code from <b>pcre[16|32]_exec()</b>).
       Values in the offsets vector corresponding to higher numbers
       should be set to -1, and these are output as "&lt;unset&gt;". This
       modifier gives a way of checking that this is happening.

       The <b>/B </b>modifier is a debugging feature. It requests that <b>pcretest</b>
       output a representation of the compiled code after compilation.
       Normally this information contains length and offset values;
       however, if <b>/Z </b>is also present, this data is replaced by spaces.
       This is a special feature for use in the automatic test scripts;
       it ensures that the same output is generated for different
       internal link sizes.

       The <b>/D </b>modifier is a PCRE debugging feature, and is equivalent to
       <b>/BI</b>, that is, both the <b>/B </b>and the <b>/I </b>modifiers.

       The <b>/F </b>modifier causes <b>pcretest </b>to flip the byte order of the
       2-byte and 4-byte fields in the compiled pattern. This facility
       is for testing the feature in PCRE that allows it to execute
       patterns that were compiled on a host with a different
       endianness. This feature is not available when the POSIX
       interface to PCRE is being used, that is, when the <b>/P </b>pattern
       modifier is specified. See also the section about saving and
       reloading compiled patterns below.

       The <b>/I </b>modifier requests that <b>pcretest </b>output information about
       the compiled pattern (whether it is anchored, has a fixed first
       character, and so on). It does this by calling
       <b>pcre[16|32]_fullinfo() </b>after compiling a pattern. If the pattern
       is studied, the results of that are also output. In this output,
       the word "char" means a non-UTF character, that is, the value of
       a single data item (8-bit, 16-bit, or 32-bit, depending on the
       library that is being tested).

       The <b>/K </b>modifier requests <b>pcretest </b>to show names from backtracking
       control verbs that are returned from calls to <b>pcre[16|32]_exec()</b>.
       It causes <b>pcretest </b>to create a <b>pcre[16|32]_extra </b>block if one has
       not already been created by a call to <b>pcre[16|32]_study()</b>, and to
       set the PCRE_EXTRA_MARK flag and the <b>mark </b>field within it, every
       time that <b>pcre[16|32]_exec() </b>is called. If the variable that the
       <b>mark </b>field points to is non-NULL for a match, non-match, or
       partial match, <b>pcretest </b>prints the string to which it points. For
       a match, this is shown on a line by itself, tagged with "MK:".
       For a non-match it is added to the message.

       The <b>/L </b>modifier must be followed directly by the name of a
       locale, for example,

         /pattern/Lfr_FR

       For this reason, it must be the last modifier. The given locale
       is set, <b>pcre[16|32]_maketables() </b>is called to build a set of
       character tables for the locale, and this is then passed to
       <b>pcre[16|32]_compile() </b>when compiling the regular expression.
       Without an <b>/L </b>(or <b>/T</b>) modifier, NULL is passed as the tables
       pointer; that is, <b>/L </b>applies only to the expression on which it
       appears.

       The <b>/M </b>modifier causes the size in bytes of the memory block used
       to hold the compiled pattern to be output. This does not include
       the size of the <b>pcre[16|32] </b>block; it is just the actual compiled
       data. If the pattern is successfully studied with the
       PCRE_STUDY_JIT_COMPILE option, the size of the JIT compiled code
       is also output.

       The <b>/Q </b>modifier is used to test the use of <b>pcre_stack_guard</b>. It
       must be followed by '0' or '1', specifying the return code to be
       given from an external function that is passed to PCRE and used
       for stack checking during compilation (see the <b>pcreapi</b>
       documentation for details).

       The <b>/S </b>modifier causes <b>pcre[16|32]_study() </b>to be called after the
       expression has been compiled, and the results used when the
       expression is matched. There are a number of qualifying
       characters that may follow <b>/S</b>.  They may appear in any order.

       If <b>/S </b>is followed by an exclamation mark, <b>pcre[16|32]_study() </b>is
       called with the PCRE_STUDY_EXTRA_NEEDED option, causing it always
       to return a <b>pcre_extra </b>block, even when studying discovers no
       useful information.

       If <b>/S </b>is followed by a second S character, it suppresses
       studying, even if it was requested externally by the <b>-s </b>command
       line option. This makes it possible to specify that certain
       patterns are always studied, and others are never studied,
       independently of <b>-s</b>. This feature is used in the test files in a
       few cases where the output is different when the pattern is
       studied.

       If the <b>/S </b>modifier is followed by a + character, the call to
       <b>pcre[16|32]_study() </b>is made with all the JIT study options,
       requesting just-in-time optimization support if it is available,
       for both normal and partial matching. If you want to restrict the
       JIT compiling modes, you can follow <b>/S+ </b>with a digit in the range
       1 to 7:

         1  normal match only
         2  soft partial match only
         3  normal match and soft partial match
         4  hard partial match only
         6  soft and hard partial match
         7  all three modes (default)

       If <b>/S++ </b>is used instead of <b>/S+ </b>(with or without a following
       digit), the text "(JIT)" is added to the first output line after
       a match or no match when JIT-compiled code was actually used.

       Note that there is also an independent <b>/+ </b>modifier; it must not
       be given immediately after <b>/S </b>or <b>/S+ </b>because this will be
       misinterpreted.

       If JIT studying is successful, the compiled JIT code will
       automatically be used when <b>pcre[16|32]_exec() </b>is run, except when
       incompatible run-time options are specified. For more details,
       see the <b>pcrejit </b>documentation. See also the <b>\J </b>escape sequence
       below for a way of setting the size of the JIT stack.

       Finally, if <b>/S </b>is followed by a minus character, JIT compilation
       is suppressed, even if it was requested externally by the <b>-s</b>
       command line option. This makes it possible to specify that JIT
       is never to be used for certain patterns.

       The <b>/T </b>modifier must be followed by a single digit. It causes a
       specific set of built-in character tables to be passed to
       <b>pcre[16|32]_compile()</b>. It is used in the standard PCRE tests to
       check behaviour with different character tables. The digit
       specifies the tables as follows:

         0   the default ASCII tables, as distributed in
               pcre_chartables.c.dist
         1   a set of tables defining ISO 8859 characters

       In table 1, some characters whose codes are greater than 128 are
       identified as letters, digits, spaces, etc.

   <b>Using the POSIX wrapper API</b>

       The <b>/P </b>modifier causes <b>pcretest </b>to call PCRE via the POSIX
       wrapper API rather than its native API. This supports only the
       8-bit library. When <b>/P </b>is set, the following modifiers set
       options for the <b>regcomp() </b>function:

         /i    REG_ICASE
         /m    REG_NEWLINE
         /N    REG_NOSUB
         /s    REG_DOTALL     )
         /U    REG_UNGREEDY   ) These options are not part of
         /W    REG_UCP        )   the POSIX standard
         /8    REG_UTF8       )

       The <b>/+ </b>modifier works as described above. All other modifiers are
       ignored.

   <b>Locking out certain modifiers</b>

       PCRE can be compiled with or without support for certain features
       such as UTF-8/16/32 or Unicode properties. Accordingly, the
       standard tests are split up into a number of different files that
       are selected for running depending on which features are
       available. When updating the tests, it is all too easy to put a
       new test into the wrong file by mistake; for example, to put a
       test that requires UTF support into a file that is used when it
       is not available. To help detect such mistakes as early as
       possible, there is a facility for locking out specific modifiers.
       If an input line for <b>pcretest </b>starts with the string "&lt; forbid "
       the following sequence of characters is taken as a list of
       forbidden modifiers. For example, in the test files that must not
       use UTF or Unicode property support, this line appears:

         &lt; forbid 8W

       This locks out the /8 and /W modifiers. An immediate error is
       given if they are subsequently encountered. If the character
       string contains &lt; but not &gt;, all the multi-character modifiers
       that begin with &lt; are locked out. Otherwise, such modifiers must
       be explicitly listed, for example:

         &lt; forbid &lt;JS&gt;&lt;cr&gt;

       There must be a single space between &lt; and "forbid" for this
       feature to be recognised. If there is not, the line is
       interpreted either as a request to re-load a pre-compiled pattern
       (see "SAVING AND RELOADING COMPILED PATTERNS" below) or, if there
       is a another &lt; character, as a pattern that uses &lt; as its
       delimiter.
