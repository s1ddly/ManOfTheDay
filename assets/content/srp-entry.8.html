       This utility generates an entry suitable for use in the
       /etc/ppp/srp-secrets file on a PPP EAP SRP-SHA1 authenticator
       ("server").  This file has the same basic layout as the other
       pppd(8) authentication files, /etc/ppp/pap-secrets and
       /etc/ppp/chap-secrets.  Thus, the entry generated has at least
       four main fields separated by spaces.  The first field is the
       authenticatee ("client") name.  The second is the server name.
       The third is the secret.  The fourth is the allowed (or assigned)
       IP address for the client, and defaults to "*".  Additional
       fields can contain additional IP addresses or pppd options; see
       pppd(8) for details.

       The third field has three subfields, separated by colons.  The
       first subfield is the index of the modulus and generator from
       SRP's /etc/tpasswd.conf.  The special value 0 is used to
       represent the well-known modulus and generator specified in the
       EAP SRP-SHA1 draft.  The second subfield is the password
       validator.  The third is the password salt.  These latter two
       values are encoded in base64 notation.
