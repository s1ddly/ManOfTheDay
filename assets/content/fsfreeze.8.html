       <b>fsfreeze </b>suspends or resumes access to a filesystem.

       <b>fsfreeze </b>halts any new access to the filesystem and creates a
       stable image on disk. <b>fsfreeze </b>is intended to be used with
       hardware RAID devices that support the creation of snapshots.

       <b>fsfreeze </b>is unnecessary for <b>device-mapper </b>devices. The
       device-mapper (and LVM) automatically freezes a filesystem on the
       device when a snapshot creation is requested. For more details
       see the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/dmsetup.8.html">dmsetup(8)</a> man page.

       The <i>mountpoint</i> argument is the pathname of the directory where
       the filesystem is mounted. The filesystem must be mounted to be
       frozen (see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/mount.8.html">mount(8)</a>).

       Note that access-time updates are also suspended if the
       filesystem is mounted with the traditional atime behavior (mount
       option <b>strictatime</b>, for more details see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/mount.8.html">mount(8)</a>).
