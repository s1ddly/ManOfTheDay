       <b>lxc-snapshot </b>creates, lists, and restores container snapshots.

       Snapshots are stored as snapshotted containers under the
       container's configuration path. For instance, if the container's
       configuration path is <i>/var/lib/lxc</i> and the container is <i>c1</i>, then
       the first snapshot will be stored as container <i>snap0</i> under the
       path <i>/var/lib/lxc/c1/snaps</i>.  If <i>/var/lib/lxcsnaps</i>, as used by LXC
       1.0, already exists, then it will continue to be used.
