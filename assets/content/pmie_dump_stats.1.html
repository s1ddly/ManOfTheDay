       Each <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmie.1.html">pmie(1)</a> process mantains a file of state and statistics in
       binary files in the <b>$PCP_TMP_DIR/pmie </b>directory, named with the
       process' PID.

       These files are used by the <b>pmcd </b>PMDA to instantiate the
       <b>pmcd.pmie </b>performance metrics.

       <b>pmie_dump_stats </b>is a stand alone utility that dumps the contents
       of these files in a terse, but script-friendly format.  It is
       designed for use in the <b>pmiectl</b>(1) script.
