       <i>gdiffmk</i> compares two <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/roff.7.html">roff(7)</a> documents, <i>file1</i> and <i>file2</i>, and
       creates an output which is <i>file2</i> with added margin character
       (<b>.mc</b>) requests that indicate the lines with differences.

       If the <i>file1</i> or <i>file2</i> argument is “<b>-</b>”, the standard input stream
       is read for that input.  If the <i>output</i> filename is present, the
       output is written there.  If it is “<b>-</b>” or absent, the output is
       written to the standard output stream.  “<b>-</b>” cannot be both input
       and output.
