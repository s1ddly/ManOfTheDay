       If REF names an installed application, flatpak runs the
       application in a sandboxed environment. Extra arguments are
       passed on to the application.

       If REF names a runtime, a shell is opened in the runtime. This is
       useful for development and testing.

       By default, flatpak will look for the application or runtime in
       all per-user and system installations. This can be overridden
       with the <b>--user</b>, <b>--system </b>and <b>--installation </b>options.

       flatpak creates a sandboxed environment for the application to
       run in by mounting the right runtime at /usr and a writable
       directory at /var, whose content is preserved between application
       runs. The application itself is mounted at /app.

       The details of the sandboxed environment are controlled by the
       application metadata and various options like <b>--share </b>and
       <b>--socket </b>that are passed to the run command: Access is allowed if
       it was requested either in the application metadata file or with
       an option and the user hasn't overridden it.

       The remaining arguments are passed to the command that gets run
       in the sandboxed environment. See the <b>--file-forwarding </b>option
       for handling of file arguments.

       Environment variables are generally passed on to the sandboxed
       application, with certain exceptions. The application metadata
       can override environment variables, as well as the <b>--env </b>option.
       Apart from that, Flatpak always unsets or overrides the following
       variables, since their session values are likely to interfere
       with the functioning of the sandbox:
           PATH
           LD_LIBRARY_PATH
           XDG_CONFIG_DIRS
           XDG_DATA_DIRS
           SHELL
           TMPDIR
           PYTHONPATH
           PERLLIB
           PERL5LIB
           XCURSOR_PATH

       Flatpak also overrides the XDG environment variables to point
       sandboxed applications at their writable filesystem locations
       below ~/.var/app/$APPID/:
           XDG_DATA_HOME
           XDG_CONFIG_HOME
           XDG_CACHE_HOME

       The host values of these variables are made available inside the
       sandbox via these HOST_-prefixed variables:
           HOST_XDG_DATA_HOME
           HOST_XDG_CONFIG_HOME
           HOST_XDG_CACHE_HOME

       Flatpak sets the environment variable <b>FLATPAK_ID </b>to the
       application ID of the running app.

       Flatpak also bind-mounts as read-only the host's /etc/os-release
       (if available, or /usr/lib/os-release as a fallback) to
       /run/host/os-release in accordance with the <b>os-release</b>
       <b>specification</b><b></b>[1].

       If parental controls support is enabled, flatpak will check the
       current userâ€™s parental controls settings, and will refuse to run
       an app if it is blocklisted for the current user.
