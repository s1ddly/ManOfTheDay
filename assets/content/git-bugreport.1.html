<pre>
       Captures information about the user’s machine, Git client, and
       repository state, as well as a form requesting information about
       the behavior the user observed, into a single text file which the
       user can then share, for example to the Git mailing list, in
       order to report an observed bug.

       The following information is requested from the user:

       •   Reproduction steps

       •   Expected behavior

       •   Actual behavior

       The following information is captured automatically:

       •   <i>git version --build-options</i>

       •   uname sysname, release, version, and machine strings

       •   Compiler-specific info string

       •   A list of enabled hooks

       •   $SHELL

       This tool is invoked via the typical Git setup process, which
       means that in some cases, it might not be able to launch - for
       example, if a relevant config file is unreadable. In this kind of
       scenario, it may be helpful to manually gather the kind of
       information listed above when manually asking for help.
