<pre>
       Creates a document id for a local file that can be exposed to
       sandboxed applications, allowing them access to files that they
       would not otherwise see. The exported files are exposed in a fuse
       filesystem at /run/user/$UID/doc/.

       This command also lets you modify the per-application permissions
       of the documents, granting or revoking access to the file on a
       per-application basis.
