       <i>gpinyin</i> is a preprocessor for <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/groff.1.html">groff(1)</a> that facilitates use of
       Hanyu Pinyin in <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/groff.7.html">groff(7)</a> files.  Pinyin is a method for writing
       the Mandarin Chinese language with the Latin alphabet.  Mandarin
       consists of more than four hundred base syllables, each spoken
       with one of five different tones.  Changing the tone applied to
       the syllable generally alters the meaning of the word it forms.
       In Pinyin, a syllable is written in the Latin alphabet and a
       numeric tone indicator can be appended to each syllable.

       Each <i>input-file</i> is a file name or the character “<b>-</b>” to indicate
       that the standard input stream should be read.  As usual, the
       argument “<b>--</b>” can be used in order to force interpretation of all
       remaining arguments as file names, even if an <i>input-file</i> argument
       begins with a “<b>-</b>”.  <b>-h </b>and <b>--help </b>display a usage message, while
       <b>-v </b>and <b>--version </b>show version information; all exit afterward.

   <b>Pinyin sections</b>
       Pinyin sections in <i>groff</i> files are enclosed by two <b>.pinyin</b>
       requests with different arguments.  The starting request is
              .pinyin start
       or
              .pinyin begin
       and the ending request is
              .pinyin stop
       or
              .pinyin end
       .

   <b>Syllables</b>
       In Pinyin, each syllable is represented by one to six letters
       drawn from the fifty-two upper- and lowercase letters of the
       Unicode basic Latin character set, plus the letter “U” with
       dieresis (umlaut) in both cases—in other words, the members of
       the set “[a–zA–ZüÜ]”.

       In <i>groff</i> input, all basic Latin letters are written as
       themselves.  The “u with dieresis” can be written as “\[:u]” in
       lowercase or “\[:U]” in uppercase.  Within <b>.pinyin </b>sections,
       <i>gpinyin</i> supports the form “ue” for lowercase and the forms “Ue”
       and “UE” for uppercase.

   <b>Tones</b>
       Each syllable has exactly one of five <i>tones</i>.  The fifth tone is
       not explicitly written at all, but each of the first through
       fourth tones is indicated with a diacritic above a specific vowel
       within the syllable.

       In a <i>gpinyin</i> source file, these tones are written by adding a
       numeral in the range 0 to 5 after the syllable.  The tone numbers
       1 to 4 are transformed into accents above vowels in the output.
       The tone numbers 0 and 5 are synonymous.

       The tones are written as follows.

       Tone     Description      Diacritic   Example Input   Example Output
       ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       first    flat             ¯           ma1             mā
       second   rising           ´           ma2             má
       third    falling-rising   ˇ           ma3             mǎ
       fourth   falling          `           ma4             mà
       fifth    neutral          (none)      ma0             ma
                                             ma5

       The neutral tone number can be omitted from a word-final
       syllable, but not otherwise.
