       <b>mkudffs </b>is used to create a UDF filesystem on a device (usually a
       disk). <i>device</i> is the special file corresponding to the device
       (e.g. <i>/dev/hdX</i>) or file image. <i>blocks-count</i> is the number of
       blocks on the device. If omitted, <b>mkudffs </b>automagically figures
       the filesystem size. The order of options matters. Encoding
       option must be first and options to override default settings
       implied by the media type or UDF revision should be after the
       option they are overriding.
